             Criminal Law Spring 2023 - Professor Harcourt

Exam opening paragraph:
Please start with a synthetic paragraph that summarizes the charges you would recommend, the
defenses that will arise, and the legal issues that the court will need to address. This paragraph
should give the judge a good idea of what is really going on, what to expect, and an idea of a
roadmap for the case

Read the procedurally posture carefully
   ● If verdict has been returned, question is whether the charge should be lowered, not if a higher
       charge should be granted
           ○ Prosecution would argue that that the charge should be what was given
           ○ Defense would want to lower it

                                       Punishment Theory
 Punishment: Suffering 1) purposely inflicted 2) by the state 3) becomeone one of its laws was violated

 In court, an attorney is tasked with explaining why a particular theory of punishment best serves a
 certain purpose
Justifications for punishment fall into two categories:
    1. Retributivist: persons who have committed crimes have acted immorally and must be
         punished to atone for the immoral action → Backwards looking: Attribute importance to
         offender’s behavior in the past
    2. Utilitarian: A utilitarian believes that justification lies in the useful purposes that punishment
         serves (deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation) → Forward looking: seek to justify
         punishment on the basis of the good consequences it is expected to produce in the future;
         Utilitarian approach includes deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation

Four rationales for Punishment:
   1. Retribution: Punishment to right a wrong – necessitates moral blameworthiness
   2. Deterrence: Punishment to send signal to others
   3. Incapacitation: Punishment as incapacitation to protect society from that “kind” of person
   4. Rehabilitation: Punishment so as to reform; make a person ethically adequate through moral
        training




Utilitarian Theories

Bentham: Punishment as an evil is not ok because it deliberately inflicts harm on a person; we only
want to punish if there is going to be some benefit from a forward looking perspective

Goal = Maximize social welfare
   ● All laws are in some way designed to maximize social welfare
    ●   Punishment is designed to achieve a social outcome
    ●   Theory rests on idea that pain is bad and pleasure s good, so life is about increasing pleasure
        and decreasing pain

Deterrence = Prevents future crimes
   ● Specific deterrence: Deter this specific individual/defendant from reoffending
   ● General deterrence: Deter others from acting like this defendant did by showing what
       punishment they’d receive if they did
   ● Bentham wants to only impose punishment as much as is necessary to change behavior →
           ○ Utilitarian theory uses punishment to shape conduct at the individual and societal level
           ○ But raises the question – are people rational?

Incapacitation = Keep a dangerous person off the street
   ● Physically prevent someone from committing a crime
   ● Certain people commit lots of crimes → selective incapacitation may solve this

Rehabilitation = teach a person how to function in society to prepare them for reintegration

Challenge: Don’t treat people as a means, treat that person as an end in themselves

Retribution Theories

Goal: Align punishment with blameworthiness/moral culpability – person who chooses to do wrong
acts deserves punishment and it should be imposed on them even if it serves no utilitarian purpose
    ● Positive retribution: Criminal must be punished for crime
    ● Negative retribution: only the guilty may be punished; guilt is necessary but not an
        automatically sufficient condition of just punishment

Kant: Morally reprehensible needs of an act triggers and justifies punishment
   ● Only punish if there is a moral wrong, you only punish to the extent of the moral wrong, and
       there must be proportionality intended to limit punishment
   ● Retributive approach builds on Kant’s work
           ○ Asks that you look at a standard of blameworthiness that is not related to utility or
               pragmatic decision-making
           ○ Deterrence as violation of moral autonomy of an individual because you’re treating
               them as a means to communicate something to

Limits punishment to those who commit crimes and are blameworthy
   ● Theories of punishment are imposed in a way to justify methods of punishment that are no
        longer compatible
            ○ Q: Are we trying to justify punishment or are we trying to explain away the way we
                punish today?
            ○ Q: Are we imposing meaning on a practice?
    ●   In the UK in the 17th century, punishment was used to fulfill the needs of the monarchy →
        Punishment is a way to maintain social order (raises Q: What kind of social order are we trying
        to maintain with our current forms of punishment?)
    ●   Foucault → How have forms of punishment changed over time and what have those changes
        represented?
             ○ How could we go from brutal punishment in the 1700s to the panopticon style of
                punishment we see today
             ○ Foucault addresses French punishment but we have seen dramatic changes in
                punishment practices in the U.S.

Foucault: Disciple and Punish. THe Birth of the Prison
   ● Naïve to believe that the law was made for all in the name of all -- it was made for the few and
      brought to bear upon others. Application of the laws does not consider everybody equally
   ● The law, which is supposed to be universal, is inadequate in that respect; it is the discourse of
      one class to another, where the two classes have neither the same ideas not the same words →
      Law language is overloaded w/ formality, not to be heard by those who speak the dialect of the
      market
   ● The success of the prison has been to specify a delinquency (here meaning, a controlled
      illegality).
           ○ The prison has been so successful that, after a century and a half of "failures," the
               prison still exists, producing the same results, and there is great reluctance to dispense
               with it.
           ○ The prison, while punishing, does not succeed in correcting. Instead it inspires
               punishment-reproduction.
   ● Advantages of Prison System:
           ○ An enclosed illegality that is possible to supervise.
           ○ Concentrated, supervised, disarmed illegality is useful as a political observatory
           ○ One should speak of "police--prison--delinquency" as an uninterrupted circuit →
               Delinquency's ambiguous status as an object and instrument for a police apparatus that
               worked both against and with it.

Harcourt: Post Modern Meditations on Punishment
   ● Advocates randomization at times because every theory makes leaps of faith; acknowledges
      that we don’t have a rational reason to punish one way and not the other
   ● Advocates against law and economics because it dehumanizes people


U.S. Changes in Punishment

    ●   We call prisons “correctional facilities” since in theory people are sent there for rehabilitation
        and their sentences were decided by a parole board → decide how long people would stay
        based on their rehabilitation needs
    ●   Now, we have actuarial sentences instead of ones that are truly individualized
    ●   Can we actually consider punishment to be a deterrent? How would a judge know if something
        was actually a deterrent?
    ●   Birth of prisons was the product of changing relations in society and how we govern →
        Panopticon reflects control, since the panopticon-style tower causes people to internalize
        discipline through the panoptic gaze

Model Penal Code

MPC §1.02.2 – Purpose of sentencing
  1. Deterrence
  2. Rehabilitation
  3. Fairness – protecting against arbitrary/cruel & unusual
  4. Adequate notice
  5. Individualization of treatment
          a. Punishment should fit the purpose/crime
          b. Can’t treat an individual as a means to an end – can’t punish them to accomplish
              something for society as a whole
          c. We can’t focus only on deterrence – can’t think about what is good for society over
              considering what is best for an individual

Proposed Revisions to MPC
   ● Still references major themes – rehabilitation, general deterrence
   ● Revisions focus on proportionality – balancing harm to victim and blameworthiness (A moral
       notice of retribution)
   ● Contains every theory of punishment
           ○ Does this make sense? Can you have the purpose of punishment promote all theories of
               punishment?
               The law typically includes everything in the MPC that a judge could potentially use as
               punishment

                                Criminal Law and Morality
Morality questions lead to constitutional questions about what should be protected under the right to
liberty – Here, the role of morality in criminal law and a person's constitutional rights collide

Debates about the Role of Morality in Criminal Law

Debate 1: Stuart Mill v. Lord Fitzjames Stephen
John Stuart Mill - “On Liberty”
   ● Essay has shaped how we think about liberty in the United States
   ● Addressed when the government can regulate something and which liberties should not be
        regulated
   ● Propositions: We should be entitled to certain types of freedom
            ○ Should not interfere with anyone's liberty unless society is trying to protect itself
                (protect social order/community)
            ○  Harm principle: Should not in any way limit someone unless they are going to cause
               harm to someone else
           ○ Certain interests out to be considered as rights and should not be infringed upon
Lord James Fitzjames Stephen
   ● Thesis: Criminal law doesn’t need to just look at harm, it can enforce morality (always have
       and always will – this is a key tenant)
   ● “There are acts of wickedness so gross and outrageous that, self-protection apart, they must be
       prevented as far as possible at any cost to the offender, and punished, if they occur, with
       exemplary severity

Debate 2: Hart-Devlin Debate
The underlying principles of debate #1 came back up in the 20th century on morality v. rights
Hart: Cosigns the simplest version of Mill’s harm principle
Lord Patrick Devlin - “Morals and the Criminal Law
   ● A legal moralist point of view – criminal law is based on moral principles and serves to uphold
        moral order
   ● “The law must base itself on Christian morals… without the help of Christian teaching, the law
        will fail”
   ● “The law exists for the protection of society/institutions so people can live together”
   ● Tolerate maximum individual freedom but express majority opprobrium in the criminal law
The debate:
   ● Hart/Mill: Harm principle = the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over
        any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others
   ● Devlin/Stephen: Legal moralism = the criminal law is always based on moral principles and
        serves to uphold a moral order – immoral activities should be criminalized because they are
        immoral

Harm principle prevailed in the sense that most people in the legal sphere think it prevails over legal
moralism
   ● People consider it inappropriate to just enforce morals – use “harm” to justify enforcing
       something on the grounds of morality
   ● Now, legal moralists have to fit their argument about prohibiting “immorality” and ideas of
       harm, not morality – examples:
           ○ Shift from drugs as victimless crimes but just immoral to “this is your brain on drugs”
           ○ Regulate pronography/sex work because it causes harm to those involved, not because
               it is immoral

Griswold v. Connecticut

Facts: A Connecticut law creates criminal penalties for the use of contraceptives. A group of healthcare
providers challenged the law as applied to married couples.

Issue: Whether the Connecticut law violates the Constitution
Holding: The law violates the Constitution, specifically the implied right of privacy

Reasoning
There is an implied right to privacy in the “penumbras” of the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth
Amendments and the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights
   ● The penumbras of the amendment give them life and meaning → Example: the right of
        association has been applied from the amendments
   ● NB: The “penumbras” language is not really used anymore and has been displaced by
        substantive due process and the “deeply rooted rule” discussed later

How we define morality matters
   ● Broad: Right of privacy (located in penumbras)
   ● Narrow: Right of families to obtain contraception after consulting their doctor
   ● Why does what we name something matter?
          ○ When you find a fundamental right (essential to concepts of ordered liberty + protected
              throughout history) you get strict scrutiny (like race in EPC context) – recall Strict
              Scrutiny: Needs to be a compelling state interest + narrowly tailored to justify
              infringement on that right
          ○ If not a fundamental right, rational basis review
                   ■ In Bowers, they found that morality was a sufficient basis to satisfy rational
                      basis review
                   ■ Harcourt says that this is where the Hart-Devlin debate is situated today – this
                      is where you argue whether morality justifies this infringement

Bowers v. Hardwick

Facts: A Georgia statute criminalized oral and anal sex – Hardwick was charged with violating the
statute and then challenged the statute’s constitutionality

Issue: Whether the U.S. Constitution provides a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy

Holding: No, the Constitution does not provide a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy;
Majority fails to find “right” of queer people “to engage in sodomy” → can be criminalized

Analysis
   ● Under pure harm principle, we would say that we need more than just a claim that the moral
       order will unravel to criminalize conduct → Sodomy shouldn’t be criminalized
   ● Under pure legal moralism, if this is beyond level of tolerance, it should be criminalized
   ● Decision sides with Devlin saying that the law is constantly rooted in morality

Lawrence v. Texas

Facts: A man is arrested under a Texas law that prohibits sodomy only as between two people of the
same sex

Issue: Whether this law is constitutional; were petitioners “free as adults to engage in private conduct
in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause”?
Holding: It is unconstitutional because it violates the due process clause of the 14A; Morality is not a
sufficient basis to criminalize this conduct (Adopted harm principle and was first time that SCOTUS
rejected Devlin)

Reasoning
   ● The right at issue is not really about a right to homosexual sodomy, but rather a right to make
       intimate decisions about your relationships with other people, which cuts to people’s basic
       autonomy
   ● The liberty interest protected by the DPC sweeps broadly enough to prevent a state from
       intruding on these decisions in order to impose a particular moral code
   ● Acknowledge the alternative equal protection argument, but nonetheless rules on substantive
       due process grounds and overruled Bowers

O’Connor Concurrence
Would leave Bowers as is and rule on this case under the equal protection clause

Scalia Dissent: Hypocritical in the wake of Casey; there is nowhere in opinion that this is a
fundamental right

Thomas Dissent: Law is silly, but his job is to decide on the constitutionality of cases not the
legitimacy of legislation

Dobbs v. Whole Jackson Women’s Health

Facts: A Mississippi law banned abortions except in medical emergencies after 15 weeks

Issue: whether the Mississippi law violates the constitutional right to a pre-viability abortion

Holding: No, the Constitution does not confer a right to obtain an abortion; Roe and Casey are
overruled; states may regulate or prohibit abortion and will only be subject to rational basis review;
Majority fails to find “the right to obtain an abortion,” “the right to privacy,” “the freedom to make
intimate personal choices” that are “central to personal dignity and autonomy” in the constitution

Reasoning
   ● History of criminalization → Against finding fundamental right
   ● Renames “right to choose” as “right to obtain an abortion”
   ● Countervailing interest in life of the fetus (morality/harm principle come in here) → Passes
       rational basis
            ○ This is how ALito distinguishes this case from other cases involving the right to
                autonomy
            ○ Is the resolution of whether the fetus has an interest/can be harmed a morality
                question? If answering that question requires a moral determination, then criminal law
                is enforcing morality
   ● Alito notes no right to privacy or freedom to make intimate personal choices
   ● Thomas says no substantive DP rights whatsoever

Decision raises questions about implications for other cases like Obergefell/Griswold
                    Constitutional Limitations to Criminal Law
Structure of criminal law regulation:




Goals of MPC

Three Constitutional Elements to Consider
   1. Legality: Cannot be punished for something unless there is a law saying you can’t do it
   2. Culpability: There must be an act that is criminal for it to be punished
   3. Proportionality: Only really comes up in the death penalty

To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute and offense (Legality)

To safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation as criminal (Culpability)

To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses (Proportionality)




Legality
Keeler v. Superior Court (California 1970)

Takeaway: Due process requires fair warning, which limits unforeseeable judicial expansion of
statutory interpretation

Facts: Ex-husband is accused of intentionally causing the death of a fetus who was not his child, but
conceived during his marriage with his ex-wife
Statute: CA Penal Code 187
Elements: 1. Unlawful killing of a human being (Actus rectus) 2. With malice aforethought (Mens rea)
    ● Defense: Statute says “human being” and legislature of 1850 did not consider a fetus to be a
        human being; legislature intended to exclude feticide from homicide
    ● Prosecution: Science and medical practices have advanced (viability) → Fetus could have
        survived outside the womb

Issue: Whether the fetus which petitioner is accused of killing, is a human being within the nature of
the statute

Holding: The legislature intended to have the term “human being” refer to a person who had been born
alive, and did not intend the act of feticide to be included; Judicial enlargement of §187 would not have
been foreseeable to this petitioner

Analysis
   ● The provision has not been amended since 1850, so the court has to determine the intent of the
       legislature at the time of its enactment → Court determines that the legislature intended to
       exclude from its reach the act of killing an unborn fetus
   ● Prosecution wanted to focus on viability – medical advancement means that a fetus can survive
       independently after a certain point
   ● While court may grant the idea behind that argument, they cannot join the conclusion due to
       jurisdictional and constitutional obstacles
            ○ The jurisdictional argument is focused on separation of powers
                    ■ Without statute, the penal code should not adapt to the common law
                    ■ §6 of the penal code intended for the legislative branch to have the power to
                         define crimes and fix penalties
                    ■ While killing a viable fetus may be deemed an offense, extending liability for
                         murder is only within the power of the legislature
                    ■ Court is trying to avoid criminalizing abortion at this stage, so does not want to
                         include feticide in definition of homicide
            ○ Constitutional argument is regarding the guarantee of due process
                    ■ First essential element of due process is fair warning of the act which is made
                         punishable as a crime → requirement for fair warning is reflected in the
                         constitutional prohibition against the enactment of ex post facto laws
                    ■ When a new penal statute is applied retrospectively, the defendant has no
                         advance notice consistent with due process
                    ■ No element of case law would give the defendant notice that the killing of an
                         unborn but viable fetus was prohibited by §187

Dissent: It was obvious that the defendant knew he wasn’t supposed to be doing what he did, so clearly
he had fair warning

Rogers v. Tennessee (Supreme Court 2001)
Takeaway: Judiciary can change common law rules and apply to case at bar if change was not 1)
unexpected or 2) unjustified/indefensible – no fair warning issue as long as prior 2 requirements are
satisfied

Facts: P stabbed victim (Bowdrey), who went into cardiac arrest, then into a coma. Victim died 15
months later. P was convicted of murder, but TN had a long-standing common-law rule that a homicide
could only be prosecuted as murder when the victim died within a year and a day of the defendants acts

Procedural History: Despite the year and a day rule, TN Supreme Court upheld murder conviction,
since original justifications were no longer applicable and abolished the rule in their decision.

Issue: Whether the TN Supreme Court decision violated the Due Process of Ex Post Facto clauses

Holding: It did not – there is no due process violation

Analysis
   ● Case directly relates to the Bouie decision (discussed in Keeler), which found that the due
       process restrictions on courts include the same ex post facto restrictions applicable to
       legislatures – Core concepts in Bouie included notice, foreseeability, and the right to fair
       warning
   ● In the context of common law doctrines, there often arises a need for revision as new
       circumstances and fact patterns present themselves
   ● Develops a new standard for ex post facto laws
           ○ Limited to unexpected and indefensible change
           ○ Argues that the law should be allowed to evolve and judicial decision making will be
                more fluid than statutory changes
   ● Examples of expected and defensible:
           ○ Abolition of ruel in other districts
           ○ Medical advances that make the rule irrelevant

Scalia dissent
   ● Obvious judicial overreach
   ● The majority misinterpreted what the warning was fair → It was fair warning of what
        constitutes a crime at the time of the offense
   ● The fact that the “year and a day” rule was outdated does not mean there was fair warning that
        it could be changed → Fair warning should be about the substance of the law

Phil Tomlin Case

Takeaway: Unforeseeable and indefensible retroactive change between commission of a crime and
trial violates due process right to fair notice

Facts: Charged with homicide at 22yo. Younger brother was killed (possibly an accident) and Tomlin
committed a revenge killing and the girlfriend of the person who killed his brother
   ● Acquitted on contract killing
   ● Timeline
           ○ Original trial in ‘78
           ○ Retried in ‘93 gets sentenced to life’ judge overrules and sentences to death
           ○ Reindicted in ‘94
Issue: The statute included double murder as a capital crime, but did not include it as an aggravated
circumstance – whether LWOP violates due process right to fair notice

Holding: yes, violates due process right to fair notice

Notes:
   ● “With aggravation” refers to an aggravating circumstance
           ○ Not aggravating circumstance here since it was not heinous or cruel, so he can't’ be
              sentenced to death or LWOP
           ○ Alabama Supreme Court made a bunch of changes to the statute that did allow him to
              be sentenced to death or LWOP → interpreted legislative intent to say he could be
              sentenced to LWOP
           ○ Court “departing downard” from death penalty sentence is an improper retroactive
              application of precedent
   ● 1981, a AL Supreme Court decision turned double intentional homicide into an aggravating
       circumstance allowing for LWOP
   ● Question for the UN: Is there a right to hope? Does life without parole violate that right?

Vagueness and Broken Windows
Two prongs that can make a statute vague
   1. Notice
           a. Textbook (p197) cases: Nash v. United States, United States v. Ragen, State v.
               Pomianek
           b. A defendant needs to have been given sufficient guidance or notice on how to conform
               to the law
   2. Encouragement of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement

Broken Windows: A recent theme in criminal justice that unrepaired damage in decaying
neighborhoods and “quality of life” offenses like spitting, littering, and public drinking and not trivial
matters, and to effectively control major crime requires police to enforce quality-of-life laws vigorously
even though such enforcement involves considerable discretion – Harcourt argues that this type of
policing has no effect on serious crime

City of Chicago v. Morales

Takeaway: An ordinance violates the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment if it is so vague that
it fails to provide sufficient notice to citizens regarding the type of conduct prohibited and fails to
provide adequate guidelines for law enforcement officers

Statute: Chicago City Council Gang Congregation Ordinance prohibiting “criminal street gang
members” from “loitering” with one another or any persons in any public place – elements of the
offense:
    ● Officer must reasonably believe that two or more persons in the “public place” are in a
         “criminal street gang”
    ● Persons must be loitering
    ● The officer must order “all” persons to disperse
    ● A person must disobey the dispersal order
Issue: Whether the Supreme Court of Illinois correctly held that the ordinance violates the Due Process
Clause of the 14th Amendment

Procedural history: IL Supreme Court held that the ordinance violates DPC since it is impermissibly
vague on its face and is an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties

Holding: The ordinance is unconstitutionally vague. There was too little notice to citizens and too
much discretion to police officers, allowing for arbitrary decisions/implementation

Note of the opinion: This was a plurality opinion; the majority stands for the proposition that the law is
arbitrary – too much discretion is given to the police

Analysis
   ● This type of law could be constitutional, just not in its current format – currently
       unconstitutional for two reasons:
           ○ Fails to provide sufficient notice so that ordinary people could understand what
               conduct it prohibits
           ○ May authorize and encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement
   ● Failure to provide specific notice – centers on definition of loitering
           ○ There is a common and accepted definition of loiter, but the definition in the ordinance
               does not
           ○ Loitering in this statute does not sufficiently join the term “loitering” with a second
               specific element of crime
           ○ City argues that loiterers are not subject to sanction until they fail to comply with a
               dispersal order so it cannot be too vague – court rejects
                   ■ Fair notice requirement is supposed to enable the ordinary citizen to conform
                        conduct to the law – can’t do that in this instance
                   ■ Terms of dispersal order actually adds to the vagueness of the order
   ● Lack of guidance to law enforcement officials may lead to arbitrary and discriminatory
       enforcement
           ○ Language orders police to issue dispersal order without investigating behavior further
               – ordinance can reach significant amounts of innocent conduct
           ○ IL Supreme Court found that it gave absolute discretion to police officers in
               determining what constitutes loitering

O’Connor Concurrence
   ● Focuses on lack of guidance to law enforcement
   ● Lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers
   ● There are alternatives that the city could implement that are not foreclosed by the majority
      ruling – provides options for construction that would be constitutional

Thomas Dissent
    ●   Focuses on dispersal order
    ●   Instances are arbitrary discrimination are the exception, not the rule, and as a result, not
        something that is appropriately addressed by the majority

Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville

Takeaway: Reflects value of clearly defined laws to limit police’s moment-to-moment decisions and
protect people's freedom

Facts: Four defendants challenged a vagrancy ordinance in Jacksonville. They were stopped and
considered suspicious. Other defendants had been stopped by police when walking down the street or
waiting for a friend

Holding: Statute is void for vagueness and violates 14A due process

Analysis
   ● Liberty is the constitutional issue at the center of this opinion
           ○ Statutes in question limit the ability to exist freely
           ○ The liberty issue translates into a question of due process of law but there is a need to
                balance safety with liberty
   ● This statute denies due process of law since it is not sufficiently articulated and does not limit
       the discretion of police → Cannot be deprived of liberty without notice and due process of law
   ● Looking at stops made under these laws, there is a clear pattern, but the pattern is arbitrary and
       applied discriminatorily

After the decision in Papachristou, states came up with creative ways to adopt vagrancy laws that were
constitutional → Broken Windows policing in NY is a clear example
    ● Enforced misdemeanors that were not typically enforced
    ● As a result, it is not challengeable because a crime was actually committed

Status Crimes

Robinson v. California

Takeaway: Criminalizing addiction alone violates 8th and 14th Amendment – criminal penalties may
only be imposed if a defendant has engaged in some behavior that society has an interest in preventing

Facts: The statute makes the “status” of narcotic addiction a criminal offense, for which the offender
may be prosecuted at a”any time before he reforms” – can be continuously guilty of this offense,
whether or not there has been possession within the state

Issue: Whether the provision of state law in question that makes it a criminal offense to be addicted to
narcotics is constitutional
Holding: A state law which imprisons a person who is an addict as a criminal, even though he has
never touched a narcotic within the state or been guilty of any irregular behavior there, inflicts a cruel
and unusual punishment in violation of the 8th and 14th amendment

Analysis
   ● Statute does not criminalize the use of narcotics for their purchase, sale of possession
   ● CA law has said that someone can be continuously guilty of the offense, whether or not they
       have possessed any narcotics within the state
   ● Defendant didn’t use narcotics in the state (no actus rectus)
   ● In light of contemporary human knowledge on addiction, criminalizing a disease like addiction
       is cruel and unusual punishment
   ● There are five ways to see a constitutional violation in this case:
            ○ No act = no proof that he did anything in California – a status crime
            ○ No jurisdiction = no proof that he did anything in CA
            ○ No voluntary act = addiction
            ○ Cruel + unusual punishment = addiction calls for treatment not punishment
            ○ Insufficient evidences of criminal activity

Douglas concurrence: The cruel and unusual punishment is the conviction of a crime, not the
confinement

Harlan concurrence: Addiction alone is not a crime, so the jury instructions were erroneous – allowed
the jury to find him guilty on no more proof than being present in California while addicted

White Dissent: Takes away the power of the state to deal effectively with addicts

Powell v. Texas

Takeaway: Punishment for an act – even as a result of an addiction – is not per se unconstitutional

Facts: Appellant was arrested and charged with being drunk in a public place; expert testified that
defendant knew difference between right and wrong when sober and first drink was voluntary w/ the
qualification that voluntary exercise was influenced by “compulsion” of alcohol

Statute: Texas Penal Code – Whoever shall get drunk or be found in a state of intoxication in any
public place, or at any private house except his own, shall be fined

Procedural History: Trial judge ruled as a matter of law that chronic alcoholism was not a defense to
the charge

Holding: Affirmed the finding of the trial court that appellant was guilty – does not violate cruel and
unusual punishment since there are not enough facts to find alcoholism as a disease and he took the act
of drinking in public
Analysis
   ● No agreement among medical professionals that alcoholism is a disease but it cannot be denied
       that overuse of alcohol is a major social and public health problem in the U.S.
   ● Appellant claimed that his conviction would violate the holding in Robinson → Court rejects
       because unlike in Robinson, appellant was not simply criminalized for being an alcoholic,
       instead he was engaging in public behavior that could lead to public health and safety issues
   ● Alcoholism raises questions of mens rea – can the appellants behavior be considered generated
       by a compulsion symptomatic of a disease?
   ● Court made a slippery slope argument regarding the extension → cannot apply the standard in
       a uniform way

Black concurrence: Does not buy into the compulsion/involuntariness argument put forth by Marshall

White concurrence: Can’t punish for alcoholism but can punish if an alcoholic fails to take feasible
precautions against committing a criminal act

Fortas dissent
   ● This is no different from Robinson – defendant was powerless to avoid drinking and punishing
       him for drinking is cruel and unusual
   ● Criminal penalties cannot be inflicted upon a person for being in a condition he is powerless to
       change → Statute imposes a penalty for alcoholism, a condition that Robinsion cannot control
   ● Once he became an addict, he was entirely powerless to avoid criminal guilt

                                 Elements of Criminal Law
Blackstone’s Commentary: Under English common law, to constitute a crime, you must have:
    1. Vicious will (Mens Rea)
    2. Committed a voluntary act (Actus Rectus)

Material v. Non-Material Elements
   ● Material Elements:
   ● Nonmaterial Elements: Elements unconnected with the harm or evil, incident to conduct,
        sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense


Types of Material Elements:
   A. Conduct
           a. The behavior in question
           b. Typically a verb ex. destroys
   B. Result
           a. Can be conflated with “conduct” but in theory is the outcome
           b. Ex. Destroy would be the conduct and the outcome
   C. Attendant Circumstance: Any material element that is not a result or conduct
           a. Typically a noun or adjective

When looking at a statute, using this chart can help apply:
                           Conduct                  Result                    Attendant
                                                                              Circumstances

 Actus Rectus

 Mens rea –
 explicit

 Mens rea –
 implied



Actus Rectus
To be convicted or punished for a crime, you need to have committed an act – Cannot be punished for
thoughts alone

On principal, criminal liability always requires an “actus rectus” – the commission of some voluntary
act that is prohibited by law

MPC

§1.13(2): “act” or “action” means a bodily movement, whether voluntary or involuntary

§1.13(9): “Element of an offense” means (i) such conduct) or (ii) such attendant circumstances or (iii) such a result of conduct
as:
     a. Is included in the description of culpability; or
     b. Establishes the required kind of culpability; or
     c. Negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or
     d. Establishes jurisdiction or venue

§2.01: Requirement of a Voluntary Act; Omission as Basis of Liability; Possession as an Act
     1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the
         omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable
     2) The following ARE NOT voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section
             a) A reflex or convulsion
             b) A bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;
             c) Conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;
             d) A bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the action, either
                   conscious or habitual
     3) Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:
             a) The omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or
             b) A duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law
     4) Possession is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing
         possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his
         possession

Voluntary Acts

A voluntary act is a movement of the body that is, in a minimal sense, willed or directed by the actor
   ● A voluntary act can be a result of a habit or inadvertent as long as the individual could have
       acted differently
   ● MPC §2.01(2)
An involuntary act is one over which the individual had no conscious control
    ● Examples include: unconsciousness, sleepwalking/somnambulism, epilepsy, bodily movements
       caused by being struck by another person
    ● Does not include those acts that the doer simply does not remember, or that the doer simply
       could not control his impulse to do, or those that are intentional but whose consequences are
       foreseen

Involuntary Acts are never blameworthy, nor are voluntary acts always blameworthy – why?
    ● Utilitarian: Involuntary behavior should not be criminalized because it cannot be deterred
    ● Retributivist: An individual who would not choose to do a wrongful act does not deserve
        punishment
    ● Other systems of care/control can be used for people perceived to pose an ongoing threat of
        harm by involuntary acts

Martin v. State (Alabama 1944)

Takeaway: Criminal liability may only be imposed when the unlawful conduct is committed
voluntarily

Facts
   ● Appellant (Martin) was convicted of being drunk on a public highway
   ● Was arrested at his home and then taken onto the highway, where he manifested a drunken
      condition by using loud and profane language

Statute: Elements:
    1. Drunk – not an act, a state of being
    2. On a public highway – not an act
    3. Being boisterous/indecent/profane – this is the act in question

Issue: Whether he was on the highway being boisterous voluntarily
    ● Prosecutor would argue: Voluntary act of drinking, chose to act in a boisterous way
    ● Defense: drunk and boisterous are not clearly causal, would need to connect intoxicated and
        involuntary

Holding: Reversed Martin’s conviction because “appearing in public” needs to be voluntary to support
a conviction

Analysis
   ● Plain terms of relevant statute presupposes voluntary appearance
   ● He was moved to the highway where the acts were committed, so it cannot be seen as
       voluntary (Defense team argument)
           ○ Prosecution would want to take a wide-time frame
           ○ Being drunk and loud are voluntary, so being taken out on the highway would be
               voluntary as well
   ● When does the voluntary act have to occur?
           ○ He voluntarily drank earlier, so does that count?
           ○ If he was drunk, could it be voluntary?

Holding: Conviction was contrary to announced principle and therefore erroneous – reversed and
rendered
People v. Newton (California 1970)

Takeaway: If someone is unconscious (either mentally or physically), their acts are not voluntary to
satisfy the actus rectus requirement

Facts
   ● Huey Newton was charged with murder of police officer who died from bullet wounds during
      the struggle that resulted from a traffic stop
   ● During the struggle, Newton was shot in the midsection before he fired fatal, point-black shots,
      at the officer
   ● Newton then ran away and appeared at the ER later
   ● Newton testified that after he was shot he was “unconscious or semiconscious”
           ○ Defense argued shock reaction to being shot
           ○ Expert testified that since he was shot in the abdomen, he could go into reflect shock
               where you become functionally unconscious – not a voluntary act
   ● Newton asserted prejudicial error since the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the subject
      of unconsciousness as a defense to a charge of criminal homicide

Holding: There was a prejudicial error in not instructing the jury on unconsciousness defense when
evidence of such involuntary unconsciousness had been produced

Rule: Where not self-induced, as by voluntary intoxication or the equivalent, unconsciousness is a
complete defense to the charge of criminal homicide

Analysis
   ● Expert witness testified that Newton’s recollections of being shot were compatible with the
       effects of certain types of gunshot wounds
   ● Unconsciousness does not need to reach the physical dimensions commonly associated with
       the term – It can exist where the subject is acting physically but is not conscious of acting

People v. Decina (Nebraska 1956)

Takeaway: Not all acts have to be voluntary for D to be liable. Here, although action that immediately
led to the accident was a result of involuntary activity (seizure), D voluntarily chose to drive knowing
his condition, so he is liable

Facts
   ● Defendant knew he was the subject of epileptic attacks that made it likely that he could lose
      consciousness for extended periods of time
   ● He operated a Buick sedan and then lost consciousness, causing him to drive onto the sidewalk
      and kill four people

Holding: Guilty of criminal negligence – court draws distinction between foreseeability from a known
condition and a heart attack (no liability)

Rule: A criminal defendant who disregards the consequences that can result from driving a vehicle
with knowledge of a health condition that can produce involuntary actions may be found guilty of
vehicular homicide

Analysis
    ●   He had knowledge and still chose to operate a car, making him culpably negligent – Relevant
        law says anyone driving in a reckless or culpably negligent manner that results in death, is
        guilty of criminal negligence
    ●   This is an instance where voluntary actions put the defendant in a position where his
        involuntary actions could cause harm
    ●   Hypothetical: Would be like someone drinking, in the hope that it wouldn't affect their driving,
        and then getting behind the wheel fo a car and hoping for the best

Omission

Failure of a person to act when he is under legal obligation and satisfies the actus rectus requirement
for crime

Basis for legal obligation:
   1. Relationship – ex. Parent must provide food, shelter, and clothing to child
   2. Statute – ex. Statute requiring medical providers to report suspected child abuse
   3. Contract to provide care – ex. Nursing homes
   4. Voluntary assumption of care that isolates the individual – ex. Taking a sick person into your
        home
   5. Creation of peril – ex. If you push someone into a lake who cannot swim, you must take
        reasonable steps to rescue that person
   6. Duty to control the conduct of another – ex. A business executive may have the duty to prevent
        a company driver from speeding
   7. Duty of a landowner – ex. A theater owner has reasonable duty to provide emergency exists for
        patrons

NOTE: A defendant must know the facts from which the duty to act has arisen – Defendant may nota
void criminal responsibility by claiming that he was unaware that a legal duty to act arose from those
facts

Jones v. U.S.

Takeaway: In order for a D to be convicted of an omission, the prosecution must prove that D was
under a legal duty to act

Facts
   ● Defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter
   ● Deceased was a 10-month old baby who was placed with the defendant, a family friend
   ● Shirley Green, the mother of the baby, potentially lived with the defendant
         ○ This matters because it impacts the duty
         ○ If mother had been living there, Jones may not have had a duty to care for the baby

Holding: Reversed and remanded conviction because trial court failed to provide jury instruction on
necessity for finding legal duty of care despite factual inconsistencies

Rule: The duty neglected must be a legal duty, and not a mere moral obligation. It must be a duty
imposed by law or by contract, and the omission to perform the duty must be the immediate and direct
cause of death

Analysis
    ●   Four circumstances create a duty that generates criminal liability
            ○ Statute imposes duty – not in the penal code
            ○ When one stands in a certain status relationship to another (Parent or legal guardian)
            ○ A contractual duty – a breach can create criminal liability
            ○ Seclusion – voluntarily assume care and then seclude from others
    ●   Assuming Jones was responsible for the child, it seems like she engaged in certain voluntary
        activities that led to the death of the child
    ●   Does performing any time of child care over time create an implicit duty to care for the child?
    ●   Law requires an act and excludes ommission unless there is a duty

Interpretive Construction in the Substantive Criminal Law - Mark Kelman

    ●   When we do law, we have these unconscious constructs/ways of arguing → you won’t see
        them clearly stated in a judicial opinion, but they are present
    ●   Can see a construct in every piece of how the opinion is realized → it is a tool of convincing
        the reader
    ●   Four unconscious constructs:
            ○ Broad and narrow time frames – ex. Status Crimes
            ○ Disjoined and unified accounts – ex. Involuntary acts
            ○ Broad and narrow views of intent – ex. Intent to kill v. intent to pull the trigger
            ○ Broad and narrow views of the defendant – ex. Reasonable person
    ●   Two conscious constructs
            ○ Free will v. determinism – ex. Insanity defense as determinist; provocation
            ○ Rules v. standards – ex. Papachristou case

Mens Rea
As explained in Blackstone's commentary, a crime requires an act and a will for it to be a crime; Mens
rea is the kind of awareness of intention that must accompany a prohibited act, under the terms of the
statute defining the offense

Mental states in common law (these don’t really exist anymore, but will be on the BAR)
   1. Specific intent crimes – intentional murder, assault, robbery, burglary
   2. Malice (extremely reckless) – Murder, arson
   3. General intent (generally aware it is illegal) – Battery
   4. Strict liability (No mens rea required) – administrative

Specific and General Intent

The two terms, specific intent and general intent, are often used to describe mens rea, but they are often
used in inconsistent and potentially misleading ways

Specific Intent
   ● The most common usage of specific intent identifies actions that must be done with some
        specified further purpose in mind
   ● Another usage of specific intent describes a crime that requires the defendant to have actual
        knowledge (Subjective awareness) of some particular fact or circumstance in addition to
        knowledge of his or her conduct

General Intent
     ●    The most common usage of general intent refers to an instance where the defendant can be
          convicted if what in ordinary speech we would call a voluntary action
     ●    General intent can also refer to a crime for which the awareness of the attendant circumstances
          need not be proved. In this circumstance, a lesser mental state (Reckless or negligence) will
          suffice

Presumptions in proving awareness and intent

Most forms of mens rea involve a defendant's internal thoughts and perceptions, so unless the
defendant admits the crucial mental facts, the prosecutor must prove mens rea indirectly, through
circumstantial evidence and inferences that can be drawn from it

Presumptions are constitutional only when there is confidence that across all criminal cases in general,
the presumed fact will always be present when the fact is used to trigger the presumption is present

Permissive inferences are when the judge informs the jury about a factual conclusion that is permitted
by not required to draw. They are allowed more flexibly than presumptions and occur when the
conclusion is “more likely than not” to be true under the circumstances of the particular case

MPC §202: General Requirements of Culpability

1.Minimum Requirements of Culpability: A person is not guilty of an offense unless he has acted purposefully, knowingly,
recklessly, or negligently, a the law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense
2. Categories of mens rea:
     1. Purposely. A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an offense when:
                a. if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in
                      conduct of that nature or to cause such a result; and
                b. if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or
                      he believes or hopes that they exist.
     2. Knowingly. A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when:
                a. if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances, he is aware that his
                      conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist; and
                b. if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will
                      cause such a result.
     3. Recklessly. A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards
           a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be
           of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor's conduct and the circumstances
           known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would
           observe in the actor's situation.
     4. Negligently. A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of
           a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be
           of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct
           and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person
           would observe in the actor's situation.
3. Culpability Required Unless Otherwise Provided. When the culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an
offense is not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly with respect
thereto.
4. Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All Material Elements. When the law defining an offense prescribes the
kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the material elements
thereof, such provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.
5. Substitutes for Negligence, Recklessness and Knowledge. When the law provides that negligence suffices to establish an
element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness
suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely or knowingly. When acting
knowingly suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely.
6. Requirement of Purpose Satisfied if Purpose Is Conditional. When a particular purpose is an element of an offense, the
element is established although such purpose is conditional, unless the condition negates the harm or evil sought to be
prevented by the law defining the offense.
7. Requirement of Knowledge Satisfied by Knowledge of High Probability. When knowledge of the existence of a
particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its
existence, unless he actually believes that it does not exist.
8. Requirement of Wilfulness Satisfied by Acting Knowingly. A requirement that an offense be committed wilfully is
satisfied if a person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further
requirements appears.
9. Culpability as to Illegality of Conduct. Neither knowledge nor recklessness or negligence as to whether conduct
constitutes an offense or as to the existence, meaning or application of the law determining the elements of an offense is an
element of such offense, unless the definition of the offense or the Code so provides.
10. Culpability as Determinant of Grade of Offense. When the grade or degree of an offense depends on whether the
offense is committed purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, its grade or degree shall be the lowest for which the
determinative kind of culpability is established with respect to any material element of the offense.


 Mens Rea            Conduct                      Attendant Circumstances                Result of Conduct

 Purposefully        Conscious object             Aware or believes or hopes             Conscious object

 Recklessly          Consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk

 Negligently         Should be aware of substantial and unjustifiable risk – gross deviation from standard
                     of care

Proving the levels of mens rea per MPC:
Purposely:
   ● Defendant had “purpose” with regard to the attendant circumstance – “be aware or hope or
       believe” that fact is true
   ● Must entertain the conscious object to achieve the proscribed result
Knowingly:
   ● Key distinction from purposeful: in purposeful, actor desires a specific result
   ● Here, actor foresees that the result is highly likely but doesn’t care whether it occurs or not
Recklessly:
   ● Risk foreseen by the defendant must be



For every act element, there should be a corresponding mens rea element
Example: Manslaughter in First Degree

 Word/Language                Act/Body                                        Mental/Mind

 physical injury
 To a person < 11 yo     Attendant circumstance                 Think about whether, as defense
                         (Background fact)                      counsel, you could add an element of
                                                                mens rea here to make it harder for
                                                                the prosecution to prove

 Defendant recklessly    Conduct (An act)                       Reckless
 engages in conduct
 which creates grave
 risk of physical
 injury

 And thereby causes      Result of conduct (Result of an act)
 the death of a person
To establish a mens rea for the element of the 11yo, defense would want to argue that at a minimum it
should have been a mens rea of recklessness – would want this included in jury instructions; would rely
on MPC §2.02(3) to say that when a mens rea is not proscribed, you can say that at a minimum there
should be recklessness

Regina v. Cunningham

Takeaway: Mens rea of malice/maliciousness requires at least recklessness

Facts: Defendant unlawfully and maliciously caused Sarah Wade to smell a certain noxious thing (coal
gas) that put her life at risk

Issue: Whether the act, which was clearly unlawful, was also malicious within the meaning of §23 of
the Offenses against the Person Act (1861)

Statute: Whoever shall unlawfully and maliciously administer to or cause to be administered or to be
taken by any other person… shall be guilty of felony
    ● Defense counsel: Mens rea is necessary and that appellant must intend to do the particular type
        of harm done

Holding: Allows the appeal and quashes the conviction – trial court erred in jury instructions by saying
malice meant wickedness

Analysis
   ● Elements of malice
           ○ An actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that inf act was done; or
           ○ Recklessness as to whether such harm would occur or not
   ● In opinion of the court, the word “maliciously” in a statutory crime postulates foresight of
       consequence
   ● Trial judge defined “maliciously” too simply – it does not just mean wicked; Court of Appeals
       puts forth the proposition that malice refers not to wickedness but instead to “foresight of
       consequences”
   ● Court finds that it should be left to the jury to decide whether, even if our appellant did not
       intend the injury to Mrs. Wade, he foresaw that the removal of the gas meter might cause injury
       to someone but nevertheless removed it
NOTE: The definition of malice, as referring to foresight of the consequence, is generally the default
rule in the common law – to be convicted of malice, the common law requires that the defendant be
aware that his actions posed a substantial risk of causing prohibited harm

Regina v. Faulkner

Takeaway: Maliciousness requires being intentional and wilful; can’t transfer intent from lesser
primary felony to the collateral felony

Facts: The defendant, who was a sailor, went to the hold of his ship to steal rum and lit a match to see
better. Some of the rum caught on fire and the fire spread, fully destroying the ship. He was charged
with violating the Malicious Damage Act by “maliciously setting fire to the ship.

Crime: 1) maliciously 2) setting fire to a ship
   ● Conduct: Setting fire
   ● Attendant circumstance: A ship
   ● Mens rea: Maliciously

Procedural History: The jury instructions stated that although there was no intention, if he was found
guilty of stealing the rum and the fire took place, he should be found guilty.

Issue: If, while a person is engaging in a felony, they accidentally do some collateral act, that if done
intentionally would be unlawful, should they be found guilty?

Holding: The direction given to the jury was erroneous and the conviction should be quashed – the
defendant can’t be convicted for an act that is the unintended and unforeseeable consequence of a lesser
offense. In order to maliciously set fire to the ship, the defendant must have acted intentionally and
wilfully
Accused knew that the injury would be the probable result of the unlawful act and yet did the act
anyway, reckless of the consequences

Analysis:
   ● The Crown has contended that while a person is engaged in committing a felony and
       accidentally does some collateral act, which if done willfully would be another felony, he is
       guilty of the latter felony – Judge in the appeal is not comfortable with such a broad
       proposition
   ● To be an offense under the Act in question, the act done must be intentional and wilful
   ● The jury instructions incorrectly directed them to find a guilty verdict upon the simple ground
       that firing the ship was a felony, with no attention paid to malice

Concurrence: No authority has been cited for a proposition as extensive as the one put forward by the
crown – not warranted by law

State v. Hazelwood

Takeaway: Sometimes civil negligence can be sufficient to satisfy mens rea of criminal negligence

Facts: Defendant, the captain of the Exxon Valdez, ran ship aground onto a reef and spilled 11 million
gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.

Statute: It is an offense for any person to “discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the discharge of
petroleum… upon the waters or land of the state except… as the department may by regulation permit
    ● When committed negligently, the offense was designated a misdemeanor

Procedural History: At trial, Hazelwood urged that the statute should require proof of criminal
negligence. This view was rejected by the trial judge and instructed the jury to use the civil definition
of negligence. He was convicted.

Holding: The simple or ordinary civil negligence standard is inadequate to protect Hazelwood’s
interests. The trial court was not erroneous in adopting an ordinary negligence standard

Analysis
   ● Criminal negligence requires a greater risk – this standard is only met when the risk is of such a
       nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard
       of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation
   ● When deciding the level of intent, the minimum for a particular offense is a question of when
       an expectation of individual conformity is reasonable .

Dissent: A punishment of imprisonment is sufficiently severe that it should not be ordinary imposed
for conduct that only involves civil negligence
    ● Notions of fundamental fairness require a showing of more than “failure to act reasonably”
        before a defendant may be subject to imprisonment
    ● Mere negligence is insufficient to justify an award of punitive damages

Santillanes v. New Mexico

Takeaway: Sometimes criminal negligence must be found to find a negligence mens rea – retributivist
approach: statue is meant to punish conduct that is morally culpable

Facts: Defendant cut his nephews neck with a knife during an altercation and was convicted of child
abuse.

Procedural History: Jury instructions defined negligence sufficient to support civil liability as one
which a reasonably prudent person would see as involving an unreasonable risk of injury

Statute: Defined child abuse as “negligently causing a child to be placed in a situation that may
endanger the child’s life or health”

Holding: Instruction was erroneous – civil negligence cannot be used here

Analysis:
   ● When moral condemnation and social opprobrium attach to the conviction of a crime, the
       crime should reflect a mental state warranting such contempt
   ● Mens rea should be higher than the civil one to justify accompanying “social opprobrium”
   ● The scope of the statute is interpreted to punish conduct that is morally culpable → Mens rea
       element of negligence in the child abuse statute requires a showing of criminal negligence
       instead of ordinary civil negligence
Elonis v. United States

Takeaway: When there is no clear mens rea, use the statutory text to interpret one into the statute. If
one cannot be read into the statute, apply the default rules of the jurisdiction

Facts: After his wife left him, P posted on facebook songs that contained violent language and imagery
as well as threats to his wife. He also posted additional violent language directed against fellow
employees, FBI agents who met with him, and children of local schools

Statute: It is a crime to transmit in interstate commerce “any communication containing any threat…
to injure the person of another

Procedural History: P requested that jury instructions make clear that the government must prove he
intended to communicate a true threat. District Court denied, informing them that a statement is a true
threat when a defendant makes a statement that a reasonable person would interpret as a threat

Issue: Whether the statute requires that the defendant be aware of the threatening nature of the
communication

Holding: Elonis’ conviction cannot stand – mens rea is required; in this case, a finding of at least
negligence, if not recklessness, was required to convict

Analysis
   ● The fact that the statute does not specify a mental state, however, does not mean none exists –
       wrongdoing must be conscious to the criminal
   ● While exceptions exist, the general rule is that a guilty mind is a necessary element in the
       indictment and proof of every crime – criminality requires a minimum of negligence
   ● Civil law reasonable person standard is not compatible with the criminal “mens rea” standard
   ● A guilty mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime

Concurrence/Dissent: Default should be recklessness

                                    The Law of Homicide
The law of homicide from scratch:
   1. Someone dies
            a. When someone dies, the state has an obligation to determine the cause of death →
               determination is made by a medical examiner
            b. One classification is homicide: A death that occurred as a result of human intervention
               **Homicide does not necessarily mean murder
   2. Within the category of deaths considered homicide, some become criminal homicide, defined
       as the unlawful killing of another person (It can also result in civil liability – wrongful death)
   3. Criminal homicide is further categorized
            a. The grading of criminal homicide is dependant on the mens rea of the perpetrator
            b. All murders are homicide, but not all homicides are murder
Model Penal Code Definitions of Homicide

Criminal Homicide: Purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causing the death of another
human being – another human being = born and alive; Criminal homicide is murder, manslaughter, or
negligent homicide

Murder: Homicide committed purposely and knowingly; Homicide committed recklessly under the
circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life; Presumed if engaged in or
an accomplice to a violent felony but rebuttable

Manslaughter: Homicide committed recklessly OR homicide which otherwise would have been murder
but which is committed under extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable
explanation or excuse

Negligent Homicide: Homicide committed negligently

MPC §210.1 – Criminal Homicide

1) A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he purposefully, knowingly, reckless, or negligently causes the death of another
human being
2) Criminal homicide is murder, manslaughter, or negligent homicide



Intentional Killings

Voluntary Manslaughter = What would otherwise be considered murder + legally adequate
provocation?
    ● What is an adequate provocation?
            ○   For provocation to be adequate, it must be calculated to inflame the passion of a
                reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than
                reason (Girouard)
            ○ MPC approach: Defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance
                (Casassa)
    ●    Cooling time?
            ○ Common law: Significant lapse between provocation and killing renders provocation
                inadequate
            ○ MPC: allows for more simmering than common law (Casassa)
    ●    Provocation that causes D to act in heat of passion acts as an excuse/affirmative defense
            ○ Some jurisdictions use provocation as a partial excuse/justification
            ○ Legally adequate provocations are an example of where the norms of our culture are
                enforced in criminal law

We ask two questions about any category of crime:
    ● What distinguishes a criminal from a non-criminal?
    ● What factors warrant a greater or lesser punishment when behavior qualifies as criminal?
The principal focus in this section is on the severity of punishment authorized for homicides that are
criminal

Homicide that seems to be a product of carelessness or extraordinary provocation is typically met with
a fine or a few months in jail; on the other end of the extreme, some defendants who kill receive the
death penalty or LWOP
Two problems in determining how much punishment can be imposed:
     ● Substantive: which factors determine whether punishment will be more severe
     ● Institutional: Which decision-making institution (Trial judge or jury) has the authority to make
         the controlling assessment of the facts

Prior to the Model Penal Code, most American jurisdictions maintained a law or murder built around
the common law → reforms in PA in 1794 were designed to confine the death penalty, which was
previously mandatory on conviction of any common-law murder, to particularly heinous homicides

Murder

Blackstone's commentary defined murder as: When a person, of sound mind, unlawfully kills someone
with either expressed or implied malice aforethought
    ● Actus rectus: Unlawful killing
    ● Mens rea: Malice aforethought
In common law, malice aforethought included:
    1. Premeditated: Formed plan ahead of time; presence of deliberation
    2. Intent to cause death
    3. Intent to inflict serious bodily harm
    4. Extreme recklessness and indifference to life
    5. Felony-murder: death occurred during the course of a felony
In common law, the major distinction was between murder and manslaughter – a lot of crimes were
murder and people were regularly sentenced to death (no sense of marginal deterrence)

MPC §210.2 – Murder

1) Except as provided in Section 210.3.1.b, criminal homicide constitutes murder when:
     a. It is committed purposely or knowingly; or
     b. It is committed under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Such recklessness
          and indifference ar presumed if the actor is engaged or is an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to
          commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or
          threat of force, arson, burglary, kidnapping, or felonious escape
2) Murder is a felony of the first degree

Morality on gradation in murder charge

    ●    Dilemma in State v. Forrest is probably one of the reasons that MPC abandoned pre-meditation
         → Prior reflection may reveal uncertainty rather than depravity
    ●    The law is trying to balance black letter law with moral notions which reflect cultural
         assumptions
    ●    Blacksone designated the worst homicide crimes in a very particular way – ex. Servant killing
         master, wife killing husband ⇒ For Blackstone, gradation depended on the relationship
         between the victim and the perpetrator

Today, gradation translates into very simple jury instructions → Case turns on pattern jury instructions

Factors to consider in determining if a killing was premeditation:
    1. Facts regarding behavior prior to the killing to see if it demonstrates planning behavior (Plan)
    2. Prior relationship between killer and victim (motive)
    3. Evidence that the method of killing was so particular to show it was part of a plan (manner)

Court prefers presence of all 3, but will accept:
   A. Extreme evidence of a plan; OR
   B. Evidence of a motive in conjunction with evidence of a plan or manner

State v. Guthrie (W. Va. 1995)

Takeaway: Premeditation requires weighing/considering/reflecting on the decision to kill – look at
behavior, motive (including relationship), and manner of killing
*shows jurisdictional split with Carroll case

Facts: Defendant stabbed a co-worker with a knife in the neck after the coworker made fun of him.
Defendant suffered from “a host of psychiatrist problems'' and had testified that he suffered a panic
attack the morning of the crime and had no excuse for his overreaction
Procedural Posture: Defendant appeals jury verdict finding him guilty of first-degree murder and his
sentence to serve a life sentence with parole

Issue: Whether the instructions on murder are wrong and confusing (Instructions referred to as
Schrader instructions)– Defendant argues they were improper because the terms “wilful, deliberate,
and premeditated were equated with a mere intent to kill”

Holding: Schrader instructions wrongly equate premeditation with intent to kill – reverse and remand
for a new trial; Premeditation must include some time to contemplate the decision to kill, which
requires more than an instant

Analysis
   ● The problem of the instructions as stated on p. 457 is that they inadequately inform the jury of
       the difference between first- and second- degree murder
           ○ Within the instructions as they stood at the time of trial, the definitions of
                premeditation and deliberation are confusing, if not meaningly
           ○ To prove premeditation, the state only had to show that the intention came “into
                existence for the first time at the time of such killing” – completely eliminates the
                distinction between first- and second- degree murder
           ○ Premeditation requires some question regarding reflection → need to have formed an
                intent
   ● Premeditation and deliberation should be defined in a way to give the jury guidance and
       reasonable discretion
           ○ Not measured by a particular period of time, there must be some period between the
                formation of the intent to kill and the actual killing indicating an opportunity to reflect
                on the intention to kill after it is formed
           ○ The accused must kill purposefully after contemplating the intent to kill

Commonwealth v. Carroll (PA 1963)

Takeaway: Premeditation can occur in the moments before a homicide; short length of time and
general lack of planning doesn’t preclude finding premeditation

Facts: Defendant shot his wife, who had a history of mental illness, during a fight

Elements of premeditation
   ● Planning: Gun was on the shelf
   ● Manner: Depends on whether the gun was there on purpose
   ● Motive: Clear frustration in the relationship and potential history of DV

Procedural Posture: On appeal, the defendant contends that the crime amounted only to
second-degree murder and that the conviction should be duly reduced or he should have a new trial
Issue: Should evidence of defendant’s good character and evidence that homicide was not premeditated
or intentional require the court to fix the degree of guilt no higher than 2nd degree murder

Holding: This was clearly willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder – affirmed sentence
Just as courts should not abdicate their task of determining criminal responsibility to psychiatrist, they
also cannot remit their right to determine the intent or state of mind of an accused in a homicide

Analysis
   ● Standard for first-degree murder:
           ○ Any kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing
           ○ Intent to constitute murder in the first degree may be found from a defendant’s words
                or conduct or from the attendant circumstances together with all reasonable inferences
                from them – can be inferred by use of a deadly weapon
   ● Defendant arguments on appeal:
           ○ Insufficient time for premeditation – court relies on idea that there is no such thing as
                too short a time for premeditation
           ○ The time and place of the crime and lack of escape plan mitigate against finding
                premeditation – this is a jury argument and the circumstances do not negate
                premeditation
           ○ Psychiatrist opinion on the defendant's state of mind – most “earnestly pressed
                contention” and judge provides three answers rejected this:
                    ■ Neither a judge or jury has to believe any of the testimony of the defendant or
                        witness
                    ■ The opinions of psychiatrists are formed by statements made by the defendant
                        and they do not need to be believed
                    ■ A psychiatrists opinion is entitled to very little weight, especially when the
                        defendant’s own actions contradict that
   ● Judge finds it clear that the defendant was provoked by his wife, he remembered the gun was
       there, deliberately took it down from the shelf, and shot her
   ● Cites Commonwealth v. Tyrrell to rebuke the psychiatrist again:
           ○ Society would be unprotected by criminals if the law permitted blind impulse to
                excuse, justify, or reduce the charge on a murder
           ○ Courts should not abdicate their function and duty of determining criminal
                responsibility to a psychiatrist

Note on Carroll v. Guthrie

These two cases exemplify the split in American jurisdictions on the meaning of premeditation:
   ● Carroll Approach equates premeditation with any intent to kill; in the case of intentional
       killings, it eliminates the distinction between two degrees of murder
   ● Guthrie Approach distinguishes between mere intent to kill and intent + Premeditation

State v. Forrest
Metrics of premeditation:
   ● Planning: Brought the shotgun to the hospital
   ● Manner: Very emotional – shows reflection
   ● Motive: Help his father end his life

Notes: This is clearly premeditated, but raises question of whether he is more deserving of severe
punishment thant Carroll and Guthrie

Manslaughter

In common law, manslaughter was unlawful killing without express or implied malice
    ● Voluntary: Upon sudden heat of passion; imperfect self-defense
    ● Involuntary: Unlawful manner without due caution and circumspection (think recklessness)

MPC §210.3 – Manslaughter

1) Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when:
     a. It is committed recklessly; or
     b. A homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional
         disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse
         shall be determined from the viewpoint of the person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances as he believes
         them to be

Intentional Murder v. Voluntary Manslaughter – Heat of Passion

Many cases toggle between murder and the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter (engaged in a
homicide with the intent to kill

Question is whether there is provocation causing intent, which makes it voluntary manslaughter →
Ask: Would a reasonable person have acted in this way
So what would count as sufficient provocation to justify a charge of manslaughter?
   ● Extreme assault or battery
   ● Injury or serious abuse of close relative of defendant
   ● Mutual combat
   ● Unlawful arrest
   ● Discovery of adultery

Feminist criticisms is that in many instances, these cases reduce blameworthiness in a way that excuses
violence

Spectrum of Subjective/Objective
 Standard                              Definition

 “Sincerely believes”                  Purely subjective

 MPC Self-Defense §3.04                Subjective, but belief has to be non-negligently and non-recklessly
                                formed

 MPC Manslaughter               “The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be
 §210.3(1)(b)                   determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation
                                under the circumstances as he believes them to be”

 “Believes and reasonable to
 him”

 Reasonably believes

 Believes and the belief is     ADD: Reasonableness standard is a bit subjective
 reasonable

 Believes and the belief is     ADD: Reasonableness standard is a bit objective
 reasonable

 Reasonable person              Purely objective (Girouard case)



Criminal law is an imperialist project
   ● It “reflects” moral standards of blameworthiness
   ● In crim, notions of harm inevitably reflect moral ideas of right and wrong → Functionally
       imposes a particular normative vision on society

Girouard v. State

Takeaway: As a matter of law, words alone are never adequate provocation for heat of passion
defense/excuse; Only a few specific circumstances can serve as legally adequate provocation
(Categorical approach)

Facts: A recently married military couple. Wife resumed a relationship with ex-boyfriend. Couple got
into a fight, where the wife compared D to her abusive father, and stated that she reported him for
abuse. Wife then asked what D would do about it, and he stabbed her

Procedural Posture: D waived right to jury trial and was convicted of 2nd degree murder

Issue: Whether words alone are provocation sufficient to downgrade a charge to voluntary
manslaughter

Holding: No they are not – narrow holding since the facts of this case do not warrant broadening
previously recognized categories

Analysis
   ● No matter how inflammatory words are, they are not sufficient to prove murder
    ●   Words can be adequate if they are accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and
        ability to cause defendant bodily harm
    ●   D was in no real danger from his wife and therefore words are not sufficient
    ●   Court relies on an objective standard of reasonableness → Does not focus on the particulars of
        the person in question, instead considers how a reasonable person would act
    ●   Societal necessity also dictates the holding → stating that words were sufficient could have a
        slippery slope impact

Rule: Words are sufficient provocation if they are both
   1. Calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the
       moment from passion rather than reason AND
   2. Accompanied by conduct indicating a preset intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily
       harm

Maher v. People

Takeaway: Provocation is a jury question (Minority view)

Facts: Maher was charged with assault with intent to kill Hunt after Maher discovered that Hunt was
sleeping with his wife.

Procedural posture: The court ruled the evidence of Hunt sleeping with Maher’s wife as inadmissible
and convicted Maher of assault with intent to murder

Issue: Whether the proposed evidence would have tended to reduce the killing from murder to
manslaughter if homicide has ensued, which would reduce the charge from assault with the intent to
murder to simple assault and battery

Holding: The evidence should have been admitted and the jury should have been allowed to decide

Analysis
   ● We should consider a reasonable person in defining provocation
   ● This type of matter should go to the jury with proper instructions → Jury should have the
       evidence and be able to compare to a reasonable person standard

People v. Casassa

Takeaway: Analysis for heat of passion combines subjective and objective →
   1. Was this particular defendant in some emotional distress?
   2. Was the fact that the defendant was in emotional distress reasonably justifiable by looking at
      the situation from the defendant’s point of view?
Facts: D was stalking the victim after she rejected him. He stalked her and then tried to offer her a gift.
When she rejected the gift, he stabbed her several times and then drowned her to ensure she was
deceased

Procedural Posture: Charged with 2nd degree murder. Waived a jury trial and made a claim that he
was under extreme emotional disturbance

Issue: Whether the charge can be reduced to manslaughter by the defendant demonstrated extreme
emotional disturbance (EED)

Holding: EED can reduce a charge but the D cannot prove EED – excuse of extreme emotional distress
was not reasonable here → Affirm conviction

Analysis
   ● New York has adopted the model penal code – 2 components
         ○ D must act under EED ← subjective, defendant dependant
         ○ There was a reasonable excuse for EED ← a mostly objective question
   ● Court pushes the standard towards objectivity
         ○ MPC was intentionally ambiguous about what a reasonable excuse for EED means
         ○ Court punts opinion to the jury → Do the circumstances generate sympathy among
            ordinary citizens

Unintended Killings

Defining Unintended Killings:
   ● Actions not intended to result in death but can still generate different levels of blameworthiness
   ● People v. Dellinger: Malice is implied when the killing results for an intentional act performed
       by a person that knows their conduct endangers the life of another
   ● MPC: An unintended killing is murder when committed recklessly (Under circumstances
       manifesting extreme indifference to human life)

Degree of disregard for standard of care can swing from civil negligence all the way to murder

MPC:
  ●     Civil negligence → no liability
  ●     Reasonable person should have been aware → Criminal negligence
  ●     Recklessness (conscious disregard) → Manslaughter
  ●     Manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life/gross recklessness → murder

Common Law
   ● Negligent homicide
   ● Involuntary manslaughter
   ● Murder (Extreme recklessness)
Murder

Unintentional Murder:
   ● “Malice on the part of the killer”; specific intent to take life (Malone)
   ● Unintended killings are murder when committed recklessly and “under circumstances
       manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life” (MPC 2.02(2)(c))

Distinguishing manslaughter from unintentional murder:
    ● Common Law: Distinguishes based no how wicked and depraved the killing seemed to be –
        raises issues of subjectivity of judge and jury
    ● MPC: Requires recklessness; omits bitter and abusive common law language (Doesn’t
        necessarily get rid of the subjectivity problem)

Commonwealth v. Malone

Takeaway: What may otherwise be manslaughter is raised to murder when there’s gross recklessness
for which actor must reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to result

Note: A act that toggles between involuntary manslaughter and murder

Facts: D (17yop) brought a gun and loads with with a bullet brought by the 13yo victim
   ● D thought that the revolver turned clockwise, so 3 shots wouldn’t release the bullet – didn’t
        intend to shoot
   ● Story is confusing with how guns actually work

Issue: Did Malone’s actions constitute malice?

Holding: It was an extreme gross act of recklessness → puts it into the category of 2nd degree murder
Rule: Malice is present where an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which they must
reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to result, showing reckless and wanton disregard for
the consequences

Analysis
   ● Gross recklessness – act where one must reasonably anticipate that death of another is likely to
       result
   ● Death of victim resulted from an act intentionally done by D, in reckless and wanton disregard
       of the consequences – Court relies heavily on probability of death occurring
   ● Lack of motive for D does not exculpate the accused – motive is relevant but not necessary in a

Manslaughter and Negligent Homicide

Involuntary Manslaughter: Is either “merely” reckless (but not the result of a “depraved mind”) or
“criminally negligent” killing
NOTE: If defendant is merely reckless, the death is manslaughter, not murder
Difference between manslaughter and negligent homicide (MPC)
    ● Manslaughter: Actor was “reckless” (consciously disregarded substantial and unjustifiable risk)
    ● Negligent homicide: Actor should have been aware of such a risk

§210.4 – Negligent Homicide

1) Criminal homicide constitutes negligent homicide when it is committed negligently
2) Negligent homicide is a felony of the third degree

Commonwealth v. Welansky

Takeaway: Uses subjective AND objective standard

Facts: Nightclub fire in Boston – owner of club is charged
   ● Was not present at night of incident
   ● Over 1,000 people were in nightclub, which had a max capacity of 650
   ● Bartender saw a light off and told 16yo barback to fix it – barback lit a match help see and
        when he blew out the match, fabric on the wall lit on fire, causing an accident

Holding: Affirmed conviction for involuntary manslaughter

Rule: Recklessness is present where defendant was aware of but disregarded a grave risk to others OR
where a person didn’t know they were disregarding a risk but an ordinary man under the same
circumstances would have realized the gravity of the danger

Analysis
   ● Commonwealth based its case on involuntary manslaughter through wanton or reckless
       conduct
   ● Act element: Causing death
          ○ This is an omission case
          ○ In the present case, there is a duty of care for the safety of business visitors invited to
               premises which the defendant controls, wanton or reckless conduct may consist of
               intentional failure to take such care in disregard of the probable harmful consequences
               to them or of their right to care
          ○ Court focused on problem with exists – prevented people from getting out of the club
   ● Mens Rea: Recklessness
          ○ Standard for recklessness: To distinguish between recklessness and negligence, grave
               danger to others must have been apparent and the defendant must have chosen to run
               the risk rather than alter his conduct so as to avoid the act or omission which caused
               the harm
          ○ Person does not have to be wilfully reckless, but their actions that are deemed reckless
               have to be intentional

People v. Hall
MPC formula of manslaughter

Takeaway: A risk of death that has less than 50% chance of occurring can still be substantial, and thus,
disregarding it can still be reckless

Facts: While skiing in Vail, D collided with victim who sustained traumatic brain injuries and later
died

Statute: Reckless manslaughter requires that a person “recklessly cause the death of another person” –
conduct is reckless when the action consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that day
may result (MPC §2.02)

Procedural Posture: At preliminary hearing, county court found that D’s conduct did not rise to the
level of dangerous to uphold a conviction for manslaughter. On appeal, District Court found that for
conduct to be reckless, it must have been “at least more likely than not” that death would result – did
not find that so affirmed county court

Issue: What is a substantial and unjustifiable risk?

Holding: Overturn lower ruling – specific facts in this case support a reasonable inference that Hall
created a substantial and unjustifiable risk that he would cause another’s death; does not address guilt
just holds that the People presented sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that Hall committed
reckless manslaughter

Analysis
   ● Charge of reckless manslaughter requires that a person “recklessly cause the death of another
       person” – for conduct to be reckless, the actor must have consciously disregarded a substantial
       and unjustifiable risk that death could result from his actions
   ● The district court erroneously constructed recklessness – a risk of death that has less than 50%
       chance of occuring can still be a substantial risk depending on the circumstances of a particular
       case
   ● Facts in this case support a finding that there was a substantial risk → Then ask if a reasonable
       jury could find that Hall’s creation of a substantial risk was unjustified
   ● Hall had the knowledge and training to understand the risk he was causing
   ● Key distinction between recklessness and negligence → Awareness

State v. Williams

Takeaway: Civil/tort negligence resulting in death can be the basis for involuntary manslaughter

Facts: Parents were charged with manslaughter for negligently failing to supply their child with
necessary medical attention
Statute: In Washington, involuntary manslaughter is committed if the death of the victim is the
proximate result of simple negligence → Court applies reasonable person standard to negligence

Procedural Posture: Were found guilty and received 3 years in prison

Holding: Under standard of how a man of reasonable prudence would act, the defendants were on
notice concerning the symptoms of the baby’s illness – failure to seek medical fare is ordinary
negligence and such negligence is sufficient to support a conviction of statutory manslaughter

Analysis
   ● Understanding the standard
            ○ Concept of simple or ordinary negligence describes a failure to exercise the “ordinary
              caution” necessary to make the defense of excusable homicide – ordinary caution is the
              kind of caution that a man of reasonable prudence would exercise under the same or
              similar conditions
                   ■ Unlike MPC, this case uses objective standard of negligence
                   ■ Uses civil liability bump up to manslaughter
            ○ Standard: If defendant, even if acting with good intention, fails to measure up to the
              conduct required of a man of reasonable prudence, he is guilty of ordinary negligence
   ● In this case, a lot turns on the timeline between when the child gets sick and when the child
       dies
            ○ Evidence suggests that there was nothing that could be done after Sept 5th – so period
              of time we need to consider is when the level of illness may not have been as clear
            ○ Act or omission? This is an omission – so why are they liable? There is a special
              relationship between parent and child, which imposes a duty
   ● Although defendants did not understand significance or seriousness of symptoms, there is no
       evidence that they were not physically or financially unable to obtain a doctor

Felony-Murder

Felony-Murder Rule: Any death occurring during the course of a felony is murder
    ● The only effect of the felony murder doctrine is to relieve the prosecutor of proving mens rea
       with regard to death
    ● Felony-murder rule only applies when the act of killing is done in furtherance of the felony –
       there are three instances where the requirement is not so clear:
           ○ When lethal act arguably occurs after commission of the felony
           ○ When lethal act is arguably unrelated to the felony
           ○ When lethal act is committed by someone resisting the felony

Common law:
   ● Causing death in the course of perpetrating another felony
   ● A strict liability offense in the sense that it doesn't require a distinct mens rea to kill; rather, the
     intent to commit felony substitutes for the mens rea that resulted in the death of a victim
Current rule: The felony-murder rule only applies when the act of killing is done in furtherance of the
felony

Theories of Felony-Murder


                                          Agency Theory                              Proximate Cause Theory

 Definition                               Doctrine of felony-mruder does             Liability under felony-murder
                                          not extend to a killing if                 rule is attached for any death
                                          attributable to the act of                 proximately resulting from the
                                          someone outside of the                     unlawful activity
                                          unlawful enterprise

 Central Issue                            The identity of the actual killer          Whether the killing is within
                                                                                     the foreseeable risk in
                                                                                     committing the felony



Model Penal Code Approach to Felony-Murder: §210.2.1.b

    ●   Assume recklessness if engaged in a felony, but allows rebuttal – not as protective as you’d think
    ●   Unlikely that judge will lift presumption of recklessness as a matter of law and jury instructions are confusing
        regarding that presumption

Regina v. Serné

Takeaway: Any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the
purpose of committing a felony which causes death, should be murder

Facts: Serné was indicted for murder of his son – alleged that he wilfully set a house on fire and that
caused the death of the boy

Issue: Whether setting the house on fire and causing the death of the boy can be considered murder

Holding: By setting the house on fire while the family was it in, Serné is guilty of murder just like he
would have been if he had stabbed the boy

Analysis
   ● One of the meanings of the definition of murder is the killing of another person by an act done
       with an intent to commit a felony
   ● To be guilty of felony-murder, must be done with intent to commit a felony – ex. Setting house
       on fire to cheat insurance company, or by conduct which to their knowledge was likely to cause
       death
   ● Judge notes that current definition of felony-murder may be too wide – proposed definition:
       Reasonable to say that any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death,
       done for the purpose of committing a felony, should be murder (Looking at spirit of law)
People v. Stamp

Takeaway: Felony murder doctrine not limited to foreseeable deaths; “a felon is instead held strictly
liable for all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony”
    ● As long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the robbery, the felony-murder rule
         applies whether or not the death was a natural/probable consequence of the robbery
    ● Stamp takes his victim as he finds him – unforeseeable extent of injury doesn’t matter
    ● Very harsh version of felony-murder rule

Note: Early U.S. Felony-Murder Law – Strict Liability

Facts: Defendant burglarized the business premises and robbed victim at gunpoint – after about 10
minutes, victim began experiencing chest pains and then had a heart attack. Doctors testified that the
fright of the robbery caused this

Holding: Court upheld defendant’s conviction of first-degree murder

Analysis
   ● Felony-murder doctrine is not limited to deaths which are foreseeable – a felon is strictly liable
       for all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of a robbery
   ● As long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the robbery, the felony- murder rule
       applies, whether or not the death was a natural or probable cause of the robbery

State v. Canola

Takeaway: Felony murder (in this state) requires that the murder occur in furtherance of the felony;
court ascribes to agency theory – reduces extent of felony murder (less harsh as compared to Serne and
Stamp)

Facts: Owner of a jewelry store attempted to resist an armed robbery perpetrated by 4 robbers. In the
skirmish, the owner and one of the robbers were fatally shot

Procedural Posture: Defendant was indicted on two courts of murder, one for the owner and one for
the co-felon – found guilty of both during trial for murder

Issue: Under NJ law, can a defendant be found guilty of felony-murder when during his robbery of a
store, one of the robbery victims shoots one of the defendant's accomplices

Holding: The second count of murder, for the death of the co-defendant is struck; NJ law does not
permit finding a defendant is guilty of felony murder when their accomplice was killed by the victim of
the felony

Analysis
     ●    Agency Theory of felony murder: Conventional foundations for felony-murder would not
          find the defendants liable in this case – traditional theory does not extend to killing if directly
          attributed to the act of one other than the defendant or those associated with the unlawful
          enterprise (if owner of store shot and killed co-felon)
     ●    Proximate Cause Theory: Contrary view would attach liability for any death proximately
          resulting from unlawful activity
     ●    Precedent:
               ○ Commonwealth v. Almeida: First stated the proximate cause theory
               ○ Commonwealth v. Redline: Court held against liability – in order to convict for
                   felony-murder, killing must have been done by defendant or an accomplice acting in
                   furtherance of the felony
               ○ Commonwealth ex rel. Smith v. Meyers: Overruled Almeida – inappropriate to apply
                   the tort-based proximate cause theory to felony-murder
               ○ Shield Cases
                        ■ Taylor v. State: A person could not be held liable for homicide unless the act is
                            either actually or constructively committed by him
                        ■ Keaton v. State: A defendant is responsible for the “reasonable, natural, and
                            probably result of his act” of placing deceased in danger of his life
     ●    Progressive thought in criminal jurisprudence favors restricting felony-murder rule – it is
          regressive to extend the application of the felony-murder rule to lethal acts of third persons not
          in furtherance of the felonious scheme

Dicta: Result would be different if the deceased were used as a shield

Sullivan Dissent
    ● Majority ruling means that even if an innocent person is killed during the commission of na
        armed robbery, the felon would bear no criminal responsibility of any kind for that killing so
        long as it was not at the hand of a felon
    ● Appears to go against legislative intent

Note: This is eventually overturned when New Jersey passes a statute adopting Sullivan’s dissent

Issues of Causation

There doesn’t always need to be a causation between the injury and harm BUT when a statute defines a
crime with a cause element, that element must be found by the factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt

Homicides are the most frequent source of causation problems – when an intended death occurs in an
unintended way or the unintended death occurs in an unlikely way, the law must distinguish variations
that preclude liability from variations that do not preclude liability

§2.03 – Causality

1) Conduct is the cause of a result when:
     a.   It is the antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred; and
     b.   The relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or
          by the law defining the offense
2) When purposely or knowingly causing a particular result is an element of the offense, the element is not established if the
actual result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor unless:
     a. The actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as the case may be, only in the respect that a different
          person or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or contemplated would have
          been more serious or more extensive than that caused; or
     b. The actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or
          accidental in its occurrence to have a just bearing on the actor’s liability or on the gravity of his offense
3) When recklessly or negligently causing a particular result is the element of an offense, the element is not established if the
actual result is not within the risk of which the actor is aware or, in the case of negligence, of which he should be aware,
unless:
     a. The actual result differs from the probable result only in the respect that a different person or different property is
          injured of affected or that the probable injury or harm would have been more serious or more extensive than that
          caused; or
     b. The actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as the probable result and is not too remote or accidental
          in its occurrence ot have a [just] bearing on the actor’s liability or on the gravity of his offense
4) When causing a particular result is a material element of an offense for which absolute liability is imposed by law, the
element is not established unless the actual result is a probable consequence of the actor’s conduct

Causation Analysis




Vocabulary for Causation

Causation requirement has two components: Defendant's wrongful act must be both the factual cause
and the proximate cause of the relevant harm

Factual: “But for” requirement
    ● Harm would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant’s act
    ● Question of fact
    ● Necessary, but not sufficient, cause
Proximate: Must have a close relationship to the resulting harm
   ● Question of law – legal conclusion
   ● Assigned based on ideas of fairness and justice
           ○ Loaded with ideas of foreseeability – if it was so extraordinary that you wouldn’t think
              it would happen, then probably not proximate causation
           ○ Not too remote or accidental
   ● “A possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated” (Acosta)
   ● “Should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to his acts” (Arzon)

Intervening Cause
    ● Interrupts the chain of causation
    ● May render defendant not liable

People v. Acosta

Takeaway: Can hold a defendant criminally liable when the result was not highly extraordinary (low
bar) – opinion notes that there is not a uniform test for when something is a proximate cause

Facts: D stole a car and it resulted in a car chase – during the chase, Acosta engaged in egregious
driving tactics and the two helicopters following him crashed, causing three deaths.

Procedural Posture
D appeals conviction contending:
   1. There was insufficient evidence his conduct was the proximate cause of the deaths
   2. There was insufficient evidence of malice

Issue: Did Acosta cause the deaths? Can awareness of the dangers on the ground be imputed to dangers
in the air? Was the helicopter pilot’s illegal maneuver an intervening cause that disrupts the causal
chain that justifies holding Acosta responsible?

Holding: But for Acosta’s conduct of fleeing the police, the helicopters would not have been in a
position for a crash – Acosta was the factual and proximate cause of the deaths but was reduced from
murder to manslaughter because no malice/mens rea

Analysis
   ● The term Proximate Cause is historically used to separate results for which an actor will be
       held responsible from those not carrying such responsibility
   ● Threshold question: Whether the defendant’s act was an “actual cause” of the victim’s injury –
       It is a “but for” test
            ○ Difficult to generate a logical verbal formula to produce uniform results
            ○ Standard should exclude extraordinary results and allow the trier of fact to determine
                 the issue on the particular facts of the case using “the common sense of the common
                 man as to common things”
   ● Proximate Cause:
            ○   Result in this case was NOT highly extraordinary – was a possible consequence which
                might have been reasonably contemplated
            ○ Appreciable probability that one of the pursuers, in the heat of the case, may act
                negligently or recklessly
            ○ It hasn’t happened before because of flying skill, not because it’s highly extraordinary
    ●   On issue of malice – court found insufficient proof of malice required for murder conviction

Dissent: The law does not assign blame to an otherwise blameworthy actor when neither the
intervening negligent conduct nor the risk of harm was foreseeable (Cites Palsgraff)

People v. Arzon

Takeaway: Independent intervening cause does not absolve Arzon because his act put fireman in a
position where he was “particularly vulnerable to a separate but independent force”

Facts: D allegedly intentionally set fire to a couch causing a serious fire in a building. Firemen
eventually withdrew but were enveloped by dense smoke from independent fire that broke out on
second floor – no evidence to implicate D’s responsibility in 2nd fire but combination of smoke and
fire made escape difficult and caused injuries that eventually killed a fireman

Procedural Posture: D appeals, claiming the evidence before the grand jury is insufficient to support a
contention of murder – murder requires a causal link between the underlying crime and the death

Holding: Denied motion to dismiss murder courts
   ● Foreseeable that firemen would respond to the situation, thus exposing them to life-threatening
       danger
   ● At the very least, defendant’s act placed the deceased in a position where he was particularly
       vulnerable to the separate and independent force

Rule: An individual is criminally liable if his conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the death, and
the ultimate harm is something which should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to his acts
– need not be the “sole and exclusive” cause

Analysis
   ● An obscure or merely probable connection between a defendant’s conduct and another person’s
       death is not enough to support a charge of murder
   ● The defendant’s conduct does not need to be the sole and exclusive factor in the victim’s death
       – People v. Kibbe & People v. Stewart: An individual is criminally liable if his conduct was a
       sufficiently direct cause of the death and the ultimate harm is something which should have
       been foreseen as being reasonably related to his acts

                                          Death Penalty
Understanding Death Penalty Law

The laws surrounding DP have changed a lot over time
3 stages of DP Law:
    1. Antebellum Period: Automatic death penalty for most felonies
    2. Mid-19th Century:
             a. Relies on jury discretion – pendulum swing from mandatory sentencing to complete
                discretion
             b. Constitutional challenges
                   i.    McGautha v. California – Due process violation? No
                  ii.    Furman v. Georgia – Eighth Amendment violation? Yes since arbitrary,
                         random, “wanton and freakish” application of death penalty
    3. Post-Gregg (Present-era): guided jury discretion

Challenges to Capital Punishment over time

Challenges began in earnest in the 1970s due to the opening from the Warren Court that constitutional
practices can be used to challenge procedures

McGautha v. CA (1971): Jury discretion in DP cases in inevitable – no violation

Furman v. GA: DP violates the 8th Amendment of U.S. Constitution
   ● 8th A was incorporated into the 14A DP Clause
   ● Key theme of opinions: We don’t really understand why people were sentenced to death, but
      we think it’s by race
   ● Concurrences
           ○ Stewart: Randomness
           ○ Douglas: Concerned with discriminatory admissibility
           ○ White: Infrequent → Doesn’t promote public purpose
           ○ Marshall & Brennan: All death penalty is unconstitutional
                   ■ Marshall
                            ● Constitutionality hinges on an informed citizenry and the citizenry was
                               not informed enough → one theory is that 8th A needs to reflect public
                               opinion to define cruel and unusual
                            ● Challenged retributive and utilitarian argument for DP
                                   ○ Retribution is not a valid purpose of punishment
                                   ○ DP is not a deterrent → LWOP is sufficient but Majority
                                       responds that deterrence is a necessary element of human
                                       dignity
                   ■ Brennan: Doesn’t comport with human dignity
   ● Dissents: Burger, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist
           ○ “Long traditional and continued acceptance”
           ○ Leave it to the legislature
A lot of people thought Furman would be the end of DP
    ● DP was being abolished around the world – Had to abolish DP to join EU – so international
         climate seemed perfect to abolish
    ● BUT in response to Furman, states adopted new statutes instead of abolition

State responses Post-Furman

Pyramid Statue – Held constitutional in Gregg v. Georgia
    ● An aggravating factor raises the killing to first degree murder
    ● Then only those who have those aggravating circumstances bump up to be considered for death
       penalty – in theory the addition of the bottom three strip away any arbitrariness




Weighing Statues – Held constitutional in Proffitt v. Florida
   ● There has to be an enumerated aggravating circumstance found by jury to put someone to death
   ● Mitigating circumstances are not considered
   ● Provides the jury with aggravating/mitigating circumstances and tells the jury they have to
        weigh them against each other in a particular way (Ex. Alabama statutes) – must weigh
        circumstances individually
Special Questions Statutes – Held constitutional in Jurek v. Texas
   ● Asks 3 questions and if answered in a certain way, the sentence is automatically death

Mandatory Death Statute – Struck down in Roberts v. Louisiana and Woodson v. North Carolina

Guided discretion is allowed – concerns:
   ● We want consistency, but we also want individualized sentencing
   ● How do you reconcile categories with individualization? Gregg compared to Atkins/Roper
   ● Middleground of narrowing/channeling juror’s discretion sot here are patterns
   ● Scalia/Thomas: individualized sentencing is not required by constitution
    ●   Blackmun: Because of fundamental inconsistency, just abolish death penalty – you can’t have a
        fair, constitutional imposition of the death penalty

Death Penalty Process Today

    ●   Bifurcated Proceedings: Guilt v. penalty
    ●   Judge/Jury Sentencing (or both)
    ●   Aggravator/Mitigators or special questions
    ●   Individual sentencing determination
    ●   Appellate review
    ●   Stages of collateral review

Gregg v. Georgia

Takeaways:
   ● Death penalty does not per se constitute “cruel and unusual punishment” in violation of 8th and
      14th Amendment
   ● Death penalty for crime of murder does not per se constitute “cruel and unusual punishment” in
      violation of 8th and 14th Amendment
   ● Address previous problems with juries by providing guided discretion

Facts: Gregg was convicted on two courts of armed robbery and one count of murder

Procedural Posture: Under guidelines created in response to Furman, jury imposed death sentence

Issue: Whether punishment of death for crime of murder is, under all circumstances, “cruel and
unusual” in violation of the 8th Amendment

Holding: Punishment of death does not invariably violate the constitution

Analysis
   ● Definition of cruel and unusual punishment is something that will evolve with society BUT
       public perception of standards of decency with respect to criminal sanctions are not conclusive
   ● Elements of excessive:
           ○ Punishment must not involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain
           ○ Must not be grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime
   ● Presumption: Validity of state statutes – cannot require that the legislature select the least
       severe penalty, so long as the penalty selected is not cruelty inhumane or disproportionate to
       the crime involved
   ● 8th A Standard:
           ○ Evolving standard of decency
           ○ Excessiveness = unnecessary/wanton infliction of pain AND grossly out of proportion
               to the severity of the crime
    ●   States ARE able to enact statutes that avoid imposition of death penalty in an arbitrary and
        capricious manner → therefore not all jury sentencing is arbitrary

Marshall Dissent: Reminds of us dignity of wrongdoer; the purported justifications for death penalty
are insufficient

Atkins v. Virginia

Takeaway: Sentencing mentally disabled people to death violates the 8th Amendment – Example of a
categorical decision, also seen in Roper

Facts: Petitioner was convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and capital murder. Psychological
evaluation shows that P has intellectual disabilities

Issue: Does imposing the death penalty on people with mental disabilities violate the 8th Amendment?

Holding: Yes, it violates the 8th amendment in that it is excessive and disproportionate

Analysis
   ● 8th A prohibits excessive sanctions – cannot be excessive or disproportionate
   ● Factors that led Stevens to decide it was no longer morally reasonable to apply DP to those
       with intellectual disabilities:
           ○ Changes within state → General trend away from DP for this group at state legislative
                level, reflecting popular opinion
           ○ Logic and purposes of death penalty are diminished
           ○ Cannot accurately assess impact of severe punishment
           ○ International changes → world movement away from DP
           ○ Amicus briefs from multiple groups opposing this
   ● Factors show evolving standard of moral decency away from executing people with intellectual
       disabilities

Scalia Dissent
   ● Not convinced by social changes → Texualist approach with some originalism
   ● Looks at words Cruel and Unusual
            ○ Not unusual: Just because only 1-3% of executions are of intellectually disabled
               people, that doesn’t make it unusual, just makes it uncommon
            ○ What did “Cruel and unusual” mean at the time the constitution was written?

Race and the Death Penalty

In early American law, the race of the victim was determinative in who got prosecuted and their charge;
From 1619 - Reconstruction, there were no formal distinctions based on personhood and who was
entitled to protection under the law
Federal legislation was critical to protecting Black people and give them access to the courts when they
faced problems
    ● Former confederate states were forced by the letter of the law to accept Black people as
        citizens, causing a lot of tension and violence
    ● 14th A was a product of the 39th Congress
             ○ Called witnesses to testify about violence people faced → Black Americans were
                 facing violence without an avenue for redress in State Courts
             ○ 14A was designed to provide EP and due process for when Black people were accused/
                 convicted of a crime

Tools of re-enslavement of Black Americans
   ● Black Codes – some were racially explicit and some were neutral on their face but
        prosecutorial discretion led to the over criminalization of Black Americans
   ● Convict leasing, sharecropping, and peonage
   ● Corresponded with shift from primarily white people in prisons to primarily Black people

Despite efforts of 14A, Criminal law replaced property law (Chattel slavery) as a powerful creator of
racial hierarchy
    ● Behavior that is considered “criminal” is clearly governed by social norms
    ● Who is prosecuted is also governed by normas → the data in McCleskey shows this in
         providing evidence on who prosecutors want to give DP to and who jurors find guilty
    ● Use of DP for rape demonstrates the racially discriminatory nature of capital punishment in the
         United States
             ○ Data from DPIC – 89% of those executed for rape only were Black and 97% occured
                 in former confederate states → All were white-victim cases
             ○ In Coker v. GA, Supreme Court found that you could not get DP for rape only, since it
                 was administered in a clearly discriminatory way
    ● 1930s saw a decrease in lynching and an increase in death penalty

Arbitrariness challenge to DP under 8A
   ● Furman v. GA plurality opinion
             ○ DP applied arbitrarily
             ○ Uneven, infrequently, and selectively applied against Black people
             ○ States took this opinion and tweaked their legislation to address these issues
   ● Gregg v. GA: DP is ok as long as there is guidance to decision makers – mandatory sentencing
        is never ok
   ● Current argument: It fails to punish “the worst of the worst” crimes, largely relying on
        irrelevant factors like quality of counsel, geography, and race of the victim and/or defendant

McCleskey v. Kemp

Facts: McCleskey is a Black man convicted of two counts of armed robbery and one court of murder –
Arose out of robbery of furniture store and killing of a white police officer during the course of the
robbery
Issue: Whether a complex statistical study that indicted a risk that racial considerations enter into
capital sentencing determinations proves that petitioner McCleskey’s capital sentence is
unconstitutional under the 8th or 14th Amendments

Analysis
McCleskey’s argument draws on the Baldus Study → The race of the victim and defendant impacts the
death penalty; in the study, researchers isolate variables to see how the race of victim/defendant factor
into the decision to seek the death penalty

14A EPC Challenge
   ● McCleskey is receiving different treatment because he is Black – the decision to charge the
      crime as capital is impacted by the race of the victim
          ○ A white victim increases the seeking of capital punishment regardless of the race of the
              defendant
          ○ Combination of a white victim and a Black defendant (like the one we see in this case)
              dramatically increases the chance that a prosecutor will seek capital punishment
   ● Court requires “purposeful discrimination” in an EPC violation → intent requirement
          ○ Diffused discretion makes it impossible to find an exact moment of discrimination
          ○ The numbers show disparate impact → Courts find that this is not enough
          ○ So what would constitute specific discriminatory intent?
                  ■ Sentencing guidelines designed to target Black people → Maybe show it in the
                       comments on the record that they want to write legislation in a way that
                       sentencing more Black people to death
                  ■ Prosecutors could have memorialized their intent
   ● Statutorily, Congress has allowed for discriminatory impact data to be sufficient in employment
      discrimination cases → Why can't the court adopt this?

8A Cruel and Unusual Punishment Challenge
   ● Discretion being allowed in DP cases is antithetical to the role of discretion
   ● Decision seems to say that there is a risk of being arbitrary, but the risk does not rise to the
       level of being constitutionally unacceptable → Assumes study is valid, but risk is not sufficient

TLDR: Asking for too much justice → Finding for McCleskey would challenge the entire criminal
justice system, since racism is pervasive throughout

McCleskey Today
  ● Court seems to think that racial discrimination in administering the death penalty is inevitable
  ● State of WA v. Gregory – state courts can acknowledge racial discrimination claims; get more
      protection out of state constitution than federal constitution as interpreted by SCOTUS
  ● Jury selection
          ○ Some states don’t have peremptory strikes
            ○   Batson lets us bring claims of racial discrimination in jury selection as long as the facts
                are specific to the case at hand

Death Penalty Improvement Post-McCleskey

1. Consider how we could have re-written McCleskey – instead of requiring actual intent, look at big
picture
2. Abolition
3. Rethink intent – implicit intent due to unconscious racism
4. Litigate race under McCleskey to find something guns
5. Batson v. Kentucky model – use a three prong test to challenge the disparity and require a
race-neutral reason from prosecutor
6. Black on Black representation (Alexis Hoag) – Expand 6A right to counsel of choice to indigent
defendants to specifically benefit Black defendants

Representation of Counsel

Gideon v. Wainwright (SCOTUS, 1963): 6th Amendment is fully incorporated to apply to the states –
for felony crimes, the right to counsel applies in every case

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) claim must be brought in post-conviction/collateral review
because it can’t be decided just on the record (new evidence needs to be brought in)

Strickland v. Washington (SCOTUS, 1984) – Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Standard
    1. Performance was deficient – fell below objective standard of reasonableness as measured under
        prevailing professional norms (presumption of evidence, or of tactical decision), AND
    2. That deficiency prejudiced the defense (did it make a difference)
             a. Judge retrying the case without all the evidence
             b. Possibility of harmless error
Not fleshed out until 2001 – found to relate to lack of presentation of mitigation of evidence at penalty
phase, but court is retreating from finding IAC

Deference is given to last state court decision to decide this issue (AEDPA)

                                 Justifications and Excuses
Justified: You did the “right” thing given the circumstances; this wasn’t wrongdoing

Excused: It was not the right thing to do, admit it was bad, but don’t accept full responsibility or even
any responsibility

Notes
   ● MPC jurisdictions don’t really use these decisions anymore
    ●   Excuses are partial justifications – excusable but don’t want to encourage it; might excuse
        liability completely or partially
    ●   Fair warning matters more for justification (more clearly spelled out)
    ●   Burden is on prosecution to say something isn’t justified but on defendant to say they should be
        excused
    ●   Extending justifications to third parties makes more sense than extending excuses
    ●   Implications for this distinction:
            ○ Do we conceive of it as wrongdoing? If a justification, no
            ○ Legality and fair warning – If justified, it should be more spelled out
            ○ Who bears the burden of proof?
            ○ Does it extend to 3rd parties?

Self Defense

Requires: 1) A threat of 2) Imminent, unlawful 3) Serious bodily harm 4) to which there are, or appear
to be, no reasonable alternatives to the defendant except use of force

Deadly Force: Defendant can use deadly force in response to a threat of deadly force – these are not
the same legal concepts
    ● Use deadly force: MPC 3.11(2) – Whenever person knowingly creates a substantial risk of
       inflicting great bodily harm
    ● Threat of deadly force: MPC 3.04(2)(b), 3.06(3)(d) – any threat to inflict great bodily harm,
       even if the harm might not be life threatening

Mistake and Reasonableness: Defendant could be mistaken in his belief that he is about to be
attacked, or about the need to use deadly force to repel the attack, or in his belief that retreat is not
likely to be successful ⇒ If defendant’s belief is both wrong and unreasonably, most jurisdictions
will not allow a claim of self-defense

Potential issues in self-defense cases:
    ● Objective v. Subjective belief standard
    ● Imminence of harm
    ● Necessity to protect from harm
    ● Mistake re: Deadly force
     ●    Deadly force
     ●    Provocation
     ●    Duty to retreat
     ●    Time framing

MPC §3.09: If subjective belief is formed in a negligent or reckless manner – key question is whether
he formed his subjective belief recklessly or negligently

If a prima facie determination of self-defense is made, then the burden is on the prosecution to show
that it was not a justifiable use of force

§3.04: use of Force in Self-Protection

(1) Use of Force Justifiable for Protection of the Person: Subject to the provisions of this Section and of Section 3.09, the use
of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the
purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.
(2) Limitations on Justifying Necessity for Use of Force.
     a. The use of force is not justifiable under this Section:
               i.     to resist an arrest that the actor knows is being made by a peace officer, although the arrest is unlawful; or
              ii.     to resist force used by the occupier or possessor of property or by another person on his behalf, where the
                      actor knows that the person using the force is doing so under a claim of right to protect the property,
                      except that this limitation shall not apply if
                            1. the actor is a public officer acting in the performance of his duties or a person lawfully assisting
                                  him therein or a person making or assisting in a lawful arrest; or
                            2. the actor has been unlawfully dispossessed of the property and is making a re-entry or reception
                                  justified by Section 3.06; or
                            3. The actor believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily
                                  injury.
     b. The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this Section unless the actor believes that such force is necessary to
          protect himself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat;
          nor is it justifiable if:
               i.     the actor, with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily injury, provoked the use of force against
                      himself in the same encounter; or
              ii.     the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating or
                      by surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right thereto or by complying with a
                      demand that he abstain from any action that he has no duty to take, except that:
                            1. the actor is not obliged to retreat from his dwelling or place of work, unless he was the initial
                                  aggressor or is assailed in his place of work by another person whose place of work the actor
                                  knows it to be; and
                            2. a public officer justified in using force in the performance of his duties or a person justified in
                                  using force in his assistance or a person justified in using force in making an arrest or preventing
                                  an escape is not obliged to desist from efforts to perform such duty, effect such arrest or prevent
                                  such escape because of resistance or threatened resistance by or on behalf of the person against
                                  whom such action is directed.
     c. Except as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Subsection, a person employing protective force may estimate
          the necessity thereof under the circumstances as he believes them to be when the force is used, without retreating,
          surrendering possession, doing any other act that he has no legal duty to do or abstaining from any lawful action.
(3) Use of Confinement as Protective Force: The justification afforded by this Section extends to the use of confinement as
protective force only if the actor takes all reasonable measures to terminate the confinement as soon as he knows that he safely
can, unless the person confined has been arrested on a charge of crime.
§3.09: Reckless or Negligent Use of Otherwise Justifiable Force

** Imperfect Self-Defense: not a binary yes guilty or no guilty – instead, it can lead to a variety of charges

1) The justification afforded by Sections 3.04 to 3.07, inclusive, is unavailable when:
      a. the actor's belief in the unlawfulness of the force or conduct against which he employs protective force or his belief
           in the lawfulness of an arrest which he endeavors to effect by force is erroneous; and
      b. This error is due to ignorance or mistake as to the provisions of the Code, any other provision of the criminal law or
           the law governing the legality of an arrest or search.
2) When the actor believes that the use of force upon or toward the person of another is necessary for any of the purposes for
which such belief would establish a justification under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 but the actor is reckless or negligent in having
such belief or in acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief which is material to the justifiability of his use of
force, the justification afforded by those Sections is unavailable in a prosecution for an offense for which recklessness or
negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.
3) When the actor is justified under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 in using force upon or toward the person of another but he recklessly
or negligently injures or creates a risk of injury to innocent persons, the justification afforded by those Sections is unavailable
in a prosecution for such recklessness or negligence towards innocent persons.

NOTE: If it comes up under §3.09.2, the justification is available for such recklessness or negligence – charge will then be any
mens rea that has to do with negligence/recklessness

MPC 3.09 imposes limits on the Use of Force, providing a type of imperfect self-defense whereby the defense is
unavailable-for an offense for which recklessness or negligence suffices to establish culpability-if the actor is negligent or
reckless in believing it was necessary to use physical force, or in acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief that is
material to the justifiability of his use of force.

MPC v. NY Self-Defense Law

MPC 3.04
  ● Use of force is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary to
      protect himself against use of unlawful force
  ● Limitations:
          ○ Not justified if resisting arrest which actor knows is made by a peace officer or
              resisting force claiming right of her property
          ○ Not justified unless actor believes force is necessary to protect himself against death,
              serious, bodily harm, kidnapping or rape BUT NOT JUSTIFIABLE IF
                  ■ Actor provoked, with purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm, or
                  ■ Actor knows he can avoid necessity of deadly force by retreating

NYPL 35.15
  ● A person may use physical force when and to the extent he reasonably believes such to be
      necessary to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or
      imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person
  ● May not use deadly physical force unless he:
          ○ Reasonably believes that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical
              force OR
          ○ Reasonably believes that such person is committing or attempting to commit a
              kidnapping, forcible rape, or robbery
NOTES:
  ● What does “reasonably believes” mean? – Whether the defendant’s conduct was that of a
     reasonable man in defendant’s situation
  ● NYPL adds “reasonable” before believes
  ● Both have notions of reasonableness
  ● NYC is binary – you are either guilty or not
  ● MPC has a multi-prong possibility – if negligent, you can be convicted for a variety of things

U.S. v. Peterson

Used to develop standard of self defense – the right of self-defense only arises when the necessity
begins and equally ends with necessity

Takeaway: Self-defense is available as a justification when actor reasonably believes defensive force is
necessary; it doesn’t require that the use of force be truly necessary – the actor just needs to reasonably
believe that defensive force is necessary

Conditions for using deadly force in self-defenses:
   1. There must have been a threat, actual or apparent, of the use of deadly force against the actor
        (Question of Fact);
   2. Threat must have been unlawful and immediate (Question of Fact);
   3. Actor must have believed that he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm and
        that his response was necessary to save himself (Purely Subjective); AND
   4. These believes must have been honestly entertained and objectively reasonable in light of the
        circumstances (Purely Objective)

Note: Self-defense can either be a justification or excuse, depending on whether the actor’s reasonable
belief was in fact well-founded

People v. Goetz

Takeaway: “Reasonably” must be interpreted objectively and cannot be solely based on the
defendant’s own subjective interpretation (blends objective and subjective standard) – the objectivity of
defendant’s belief may be informed by circumstances of the case (like the defendant’s past experiences)

Facts: Four kids were in subway car with defendant who had a concealed weapon, which he began
carrying after he was mugged a few years prior
    ● One of the kids walked up to Goetz and demanded money from him – defendant shot each of
        the kids and shot with the intention to kill them
    ● No evidence that the kids were armed, but some had screwdrivers in their coats
    ● Admitted to the police that he shot them and told cops he would have shot the kids more times
        if he had enough bullets
Procedural Posture: Prosecutor gave grand jury instructions that it should consider Goetz’s conduct in
light of what a reasonable person would believe – Does reasonableness consider the person's subjective
belief? Based on these instructions, the indictment was dismissed by the lower court

Statute: NYPL 35 lays out situations where one can use deadly physical force upon another:
    a. He reasonably believes that such other person is using or about to use deadly force
    b. He reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit a felony

Issue: Whether the standard for self-defense is a reasonable person standard or a standard that is
subjective to the individual

Holding: Indictment should be reinstated – doesn’t mean he is guilty, but means the case will go back
to court

Analysis
   ● NY adopted much of the MPC, but crucially added language of “reasonably” before believes
       → Interpreting NYPL to say “reasonable to him” would render “reasonably” meaningless and
       would allow subjective views to completely exonerate him
   ● The interpretation of the lower court would allow citizens to set their own standards for
       permissible use of force
   ● A reasonableness inquiry happens with regard to the actual circumstances of the particular
       incident, and includes past experiences of the defendant


Battered Women Syndrome

A cycle of “learned helplessness” developed over a period of cycles involving beatings, reconciliation,
and growing tension, causing people to believe that there is no escape

State v. Norman

Takeaway: To claim BWS as a perfect self-defense, the threat must be something concrete and material
at the time of the use of force, not an ongoing, consistent threat of abuse

Facts: Norman was badly abused during 25-year marriage; she shot husband while he was asleep and
was charged with first-degree murder
   ● At trial, she presented evidence of suffering from battered wife syndrome as proof of perfect
        self-defense
   ● Note: on day before she killed husband, he had beaten her really badly – she clearly felt like
        she was out of other options

Procedural Posture: Convicted of voluntary manslaughter – defendant appealed; Court of Appeals
found that jury could have reasonably found that she killed her husband in self-defense
Holding: Jury could not have reasonably found she killed her husband in self-defense; defendant in
present case was not entitled to jury instruction on perfect or imperfect self-defense → no new trial

Analysis
RULE: Self-defense can be perfect or imperfect
   ● Perfect: Self-Defense:, viewed in light most favorable to the defendant, tends to show that at
        the time of the killing it appeared to the defendant and she reasonably believed it to be
        necessary to kill her husband to save herself from imminent death or great bodily harm
   ● Imperfect Self-Defense: When defendant is the initial aggressor, but without intent to
        kill/seriously injure, and decedent escalates confrontation where defendant reasonably believes
        there’s imminent threat of death/great bodily harm – reduced liability
The facts of this case do not show that the defendant could have reasonably believed herself to be under
imminent threat of great bodily harm since the spouse was asleep

Duty to Retreat

Traditional view: Only use deadly force when you’ve exhausted every chance to flee – some
jurisdictions still use this to an extent but have an exception for an intruder in your home (Castle
exception)

Stand Your Ground Statutes: Permit actor to meet force with deadly force, even in public spaces
where retreat is possible
SYG Case: State v. Smiley (FL, 2006)
   ● Smiley (Cab driver) gave ride home to someone who exited the vehicle then pulled a knife;
        Smiley shot the man even though he could have driven away
   ● FL Common law required retreat at this time – so he was convicted of first degree murder
   ● Outcome likely would have been different if the event had occurred

The “Castle” Exception:
   a. INtruders: In jurisdictions requiring retreat before deadly force may be used, an exception is
      invariably made when the defendant is attacked in his own home by the intruder
   b. Guests: Only a few states require a homeowner to retreat in this situation
   c. Co-occupants: Causes a lot of disagreement in the courts, but MPc resorts that co-occupants
      can use deadly force rather than retreat

George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin (Self-Defense in Florida)

Facts: TM was walking home at night with a hoodie on – GZ was racist and called 911; after calling
911, GZ followed TM even though dispatcher told him not to; GZ claimed that he was punched in the
face

Statutes
    ● 776.012: Justified in using force, except deadly force, when and to the extent that the person
        reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend against imminent use
            ○   Can use deadly force without duty to retreat if Reasonably believes that such force is
                necessary to prevent imminent death
    ●   The justification is not available to any person who
           ○ Is attempting to commit, committing, or escaping from a felony
           ○ Initially provokes use of force UNLESS person reasonably believes they are in
                imminent danger and have exhausted other options

Procedural Posture – Charges and Jury Instructions
Stand Your Ground law delayed arrest – then Zimmerman waived his right to an immunity hearing

GZ was charged with 2nd degree murder under FL law and was tried for 2nd degree murder and
manslaughter
2nd Degree Murder Charge
    ● Standard for 2nd Degree according to jury instructions:
            ○ TM is dead
            ○ Death was caused by GZ
            ○ The killing was unlawful
    ● Mens Rea: Depraved mind – bellow are possible mens reas that could attach to a depraved
        mind:
            ○ Act that ordinary person knows would kill or harm another
            ○ Act done with evil intent
            ○ Act indicates indifference to ordinary life
Manslaughter Charge
    ● Standard for manslaughter per jury instructions
            ○ ™ is dead
            ○ GZ intentionally committed an act or acts that caused death of TM
    ● Jury instructions do not include a mens rea
    ● Recall: Can’t be guilty of manslaughter for a merely negligent act → without conscious intent
        to harm it would be negligence though?
TLDR: The jury instructions in this case were a disaster and it is hard to imagine how a jury could have
actually made sense of this

How does the self-defense statute in FL work?
  ● Stand Your Ground Law
          ○ Not required to retreat when threatened in force
          ○ Subjective factor “Reasonably Believes” works the same way as it does in NYPL
          ○ Justified in using deadly force with no duty to retreat if the person reasonably believes
              that the use of force is necessary to prevent death or harm
  ● How does provocation work?
          ○ Ask whether GZ was engaging in a forcible felony (assault) → If yes, he could not
              claim OR
          ○ If he initially provoked use of force, he cannot use force UNLESS:
                   ■ Force is so great that GZ reasonably believed there was imminent danger
                     ■   Exhausted reasonable means to escape the danger → if he provokes, SYG goes
                         away (Similar to duty to retreat under MPC)
    ●   GZ could have invoked immunity due to a different section of the statute, which would have
        led to a hearing, but he did not, so it was treated like a typical self-defense case

Outcome
GZ was acquitted of charge under FL self-defense statute, not the immunities provision of the statute
What did the decision turn on?
   ● NOT about immunities
   ● Belief standard → Reasonableness: When did he reasonably believe he as at risk of imminent
       harm
   ● Provocation → If he provoked, did he exhaust every reasonable means to leave

Law Enforcement Use of Deadly Force (Omavi Shakur)

The law authorizes both police officers and citizens to use force to stop crime

Police ca use legal force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent a felon from escaping
arrest but lethal force can’t be used to prevent escape of a misdemeanor

SCOTUS has held that it is an unreasonable seizure of a person in violation of the 4th Amendment
for the police deadly force to apprehend a fleeing felon unless
    1. Deadly force is necessary to prevent escape;
    2. If practical, a warning is given;
    3. The officer has probable cause to believe the felon poses a serious threat of death or serious
        bodily injury to others if not apprehended

Only need to believe force is necessary to use it under MPC – really hard for the prosecution to show
that they have a mens rea of knowledge or intent based on this

MPC 3.09 imposes limits on the Use of Force, providing a type of imperfect self-defense whereby the
defense is unavailable-for an offense for which recklessness or negligence suffices to establish
culpability-if the actor is negligent or reckless in believing it was necessary to use physical force, or in
acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief that is material to the justifiability of his use of
force.

Bradley Blackshire Case

Facts: Bradley had prior trauma with gun violence; officer pointed gun in his face and when Bradley
slowly started to drive away, the officer shot 14 times

Obstacles for civil litigation:
   1. To get municipal liability, the municipality had to indemnify the officer (not all states require
       this)
    2. Disposition of the jury matters → The jury pool plays a big role in the outcome of cases

In Blackshire case, there was an investigation, but prosecutor did not think there was sufficient
evidence – multiple counts:
    ● Constitutional Tort → Violated 4A using excessive force
    ● Failure to provide medical care
    ● Failure to intervene
*Policies of the police department played a major role in this incident

Note on monetary v. non-monetary liability:
   ● The city in Blackshire was willing to settle on bad training policies → Asked for $5 million
   ● Asked for performance improvement → more training (Could be something abolitionists fight
       against, since it does mean more resources going to police department
   ● Asked PD to film a video of Blackshire’s mother talking about the incident to show to recruits
       for the next 10 years
   ● Agreed to dismiss claims against the officer if he agreed to engage in restorative justice
       practices with the family

Grand Juries
   ● A tool that predominantly serves to protect police officers instances of police shootings
   ● A practice dominated by the procession – not an even handed approach
   ● RECALL: Grand juries DO NOT give verdicts

Constitutional Limits on Law Enforcement USe of Force
Tennessee v. Garner: Police can’t use deadly force unless officer has probable cause (reasonable
suspicion) to believe the suspect poses a significant threat to officers or others and it is necessary to
prevent escape

Graham v. Connor: Police can’t use non-deadly force unless objective reasonable police officer on the
scene, under all the circumstances, including severity of the crime, would have done the same thing
(objective)

Scott v. Harris: Police cannot ram cars

                                      Necessity and Duress
Actus Rectus: The law has rejected non voluntary act argument (Defendant under pressure is not
choosing act)
Mens Rea: Defendant might argue that he never subjectively thought about the risk because he was
consumed by a concern for his own safety… defendant could argue no mens rea as to the result (an
element negation)

There are three types of compulsion defenses:
    1. Necessity – someone felt like they had no choice
          a. Framed as an excuse
          b. Example: Natural disaster
          c. Focuses on the subjective feeling of having no choice
    2. Choice of lesser evils – social welfare is increased if we choose the lesser evil
          a. A justification
          b. Focuses on objective welfare maximization
    3. Duress – Idea of gun to the head; you have no choice
          a. Closer to necessity because of subjective belief
          b. Threat is “Do this act or else”

Note on Necessity v. Duress: Necessity does not require threat of death or serious bodily harm; As
long as the defendant actually inflicts less harm than he was threatened with, the claim of necessity can
be made

Necessity/Choice of Lesser Evils

Genuine necessity rests of the unavailability of alternatives that would avoid both evils, and that
typically when the evil is not imminent, some such alternative will be available, but it is a mistake to
erect imminence as an absolute requirement, since there may be situations in which an otherwise illegal
act is necessary to avoid an evil that may occur in the future

Common Law Elements of Necessity:
  a. A treat (usually from a natural source) of
  b. Imminent injury to the person or property
  c. For which there are no (reasonable) alternatives except the commission of a crime;
  d. The defendants acts must prevent an equal or more serious harm;
  e. The defendant must not have created the conditions of his own dilemma

Imminence:
  ● Not really clear what imminent means
  ● Cardozo suggests that no act is ever “necessary” at the time it is committed, because relief
      might come the very second the act is done

Choice of Evils: Someone (usually a defendant) is threatened with serious harm and chooses (to the
extent that one chooses in a situation) to inflict harm in a way that would otherwise be deemed criminal

Statutory Definitions of Necessity/Lesser of evils

MPC Section 3.02: Actor believes “the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater
than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged
    ● “Believes” = subjective
    ● “Greater” = Objective *comment says it is not enough simply that the defendant believes it to
        be greater
    ●   Feeling of necessity and lesser of evils

NYPL 35.05: Such conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or
private injury which is about to occur through no fault of the actor
    ● No feeling of “greater than”/lesser of evils, just necessity
    ● Compared to IL and MPC: “No fault of actor” is added – clean hands

Regina v. Dudley

Facts: 3 men and cabin boy were stranded during a shipwreck – Two of the men killed the cabin boy
and they ate him; the third never consented to killing the cabin boy

Charge: Dudley and Stephens were charged with murder of the cabin boy – third man on the boat
ended up as prosecution witness

Holding: Death sentence – was later commuted; law and morality are coextensive, but only the king
can give mercy

Reasoning:
   ● At the time, self defense was the only available defense → Court considered necessity and goes
       through the possible necessity defenses but ultimately rejects them
   ● Although morality does not technically equal legality, cannot absolutely divorce those two
       concepts → Court ties this to the sacrifice of Christ then argues that the captain should have
       sacrificed himself

Notes from class discussion:
   ● Could we have resolved this case using a utilitarian/lesser evil approach?
             ○ Parker was less experienced sailor and wouldn't have helped them get to safety
             ○ Parket doesn’t have a family, so there is less of a loss
             ○ BUT Parker is younger nad has more life ahead of him
   ● Is there any deterrence value of the death sentence here? Probably not – unlikely that people in
        this circumstance in the future would, under threat of starvation, but deterred because of the
        threat of later potentially being sentenced to death
   ● Harcourt says: Maybe social welfare maximizing could be a defense (choice of two evils) if the
        metric to choose was morally right

People v. Unger

Facts: Unger escaped from prison because he was threatened by a fellow inmate and then assaulted by
other inmates

Issue: Whether it was an error for the court to instruct the jury that it must disregard the reasons given
for defendant’s escape and to conversely refuse to instruct the jury on the statutory defenses of
compulsion and necessity
Legal Standard for Escape in Illinois: The accused was without blame in occasioning or developing
the situation and reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private injury
greater than the injury which might reasonably result from their own conduct
    ● Sounds like lesser of two evils: Injury greater than the injury that might reasonably result from
         his own conduct
    ● Also sounds like necessity: Reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to prevent

Holding: Not adopting Lovercamp as conjunctive – relevant but not required; affirm remand for new
trial where jury is allowed to consider Unger’s reasons for escape

Analysis
   ● Typically the courts have been reluctant to permit defenses of compulsion and necessity for
       prison escapes – based in public policy concerns
           ○ BUT in this case, they find that necessity is an appropriate defense → Defendant’s
                testimony was sufficient to raise the affirmative defense from the IL statute
           ○ The testimony means that D was entitled to have a jury consider the defense on basis
                of his testimony
   ● The State wants the court to apply a more stringent test → Lovercamp Standard: An escapee is
       entitled to necessity jury instruction if the following conditions are met:
           ○ Prisoner is faced with specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack, or substantial
                bodily injury in the immediate future
           ○ No time for complaint to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints
           ○ No time or opportunity to resort to the courts
           ○ No evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other “innocent”
                persons in the escape AND
           ○ IMmediately alerts proper authorities when they have attained a position of safety
                **UNGER FAILS TO MEET THIS PRONG
   ● Courts calculus of harms (According to Harcourt)
           ○ Imminence of harm to be avoided
           ○ Likelihood that illegality will avoid harm
           ○ Mitigating harms of illegality
           ○ Where there other alternatives to avoid harm
   ● Court in this case rejects Lovercamp as a conjunctive test – don’t need to meet every one of the
       prongs to establish a meritorious necessity defense

Dissent: A holding this broad raises major public policy concerns and we need clear boundaries like
the ones set forth in the Lovercamp standard

Note: In United States v. Bailey (1980), the Supreme Court held, contrary to Unger but in accord with
Lovercamp, that a prerequisite for invoking the necessity defense in a federal prosecution for prison
escape is that the defendant make a bona fide effort to surrender or return “as soon as the duress or
necessity had lost its coercive force”
United States v. Schoon

Takeaway: Necessity can never be proved in a case of indirect civil disobedience

Facts: In 1989, 30 people, including appellants, protested the U.S. involvement in El Salvador and
were arrested

Procedural Posture: At trial, appellants asserted a necessity defense, contending that their acts in
protest of American involvement in El Salvador were necessary to avoid further bloodshed in that
country

Issue: Whether the district court improperly denied the appellants a necessity defense

Holding: The necessity defense is inapplicable in cases like this

Analysis
   ● To invoke defense of necessity, defendants must show:
           ○ They were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evils
           ○ They acted to prevent imminent harm
           ○ They reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the
               harm to be averted
           ○ They had no legal alternatives to violating the law
           ○ *NOTE: This is a conjunctive test and a court can preclude invocation of necessity
               defense if proof is deficient with regard to any of the four elements
   ● Applying the standard to the facts of this case:
           ○ Petitioning Congress to change a policy is always a legal alternative in these cases,
               regardless of the likelihood of the success, so committing a crime isn’t necessary
           ○ Protested harm is never imminent
           ○ The law/policy being protested is actually legal, so it is not a harm
           ○ There is not a nexus between the action and the harm sought to be prevented
   ● Court affirms lower court on public policy grounds → There is a problem with recognizing a
       necessity defense in indirect civil disobedience cases

Duress

Typically is a “gun to the head” scenario

Common Law Elements of Duress:
  a. A well-founded fear, generated by
  b. A threat from a human being of
  c. An imminent (or “immediate”)
  d. Serious bodily harm or death
  e. To himself (or sometimes a near relative)
  f. Not of his own doing
§2.09 – Duress

1) It is an affirmative defense that the actor engaged in the conduct charged to constitute an offense because he was coerced to
do so by the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable
firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.
2) The defense provided by this Section is unavailable if the actor recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was
probable that he would be subjected to duress. The defense is also unavailable if he was negligent in placing himself in such a
situation, whenever negligence suffices to establish culpability for the offense charged.
3) It is not a defense that a woman acted on the command of her husband, unless she acted under such coercion as would
establish a defense under this Section. [The presumption that a woman, acting in the presence of her husband, is coerced is
abolished.]
4) When the conduct of the actor would otherwise be justifiable under Section 3.02, this Section does not preclude such
defense.

State v. Toscano

Facts: Chiropractor charged with false insurance claims
   ● Defense: Under duress - A man named Leonardo had threatened Toscano and his wife
   ● Admits to having committed the crime

Procedural Posture: At trial, judge granted State’s motion to exclude any further testimony regarding
duress and chose not to charge the jury on that defense

Issue: Whether the trial judge was incorrect in excluding testimony regarding duress and not charging
the jury with instructions related to duress

Holding: Reverses the decision of the trial judge and remands for a new trial so that Toscano can
present a duress defense

Analysis
   ● New Jersey does not have an applicable standard defining the defense of duress – relying on
       common law principles
           ○ At common law, duress was only available when alleged coercion involved use of
                threat of harm which is “present, imminent, and pending”
           ○ To excuse crime, the threat must induce fear in a man of ordinary fortitude and courage
                → Objective standard
           ○ At common law, a third party receiving threats can justify duress
   ● This court takes a more broad view than the common law → Under some circumstances, a
       minor criminal offense must be excused even if the threat is unlikely to result in death or
       serious bodily injury
   ● Rule Adopted: Defendant engaged in conduct because he was coerced to do so by the use of, or
       threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of
       reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist
   ● Compare to MPC:
           ○ Says the same about “reasonable firmness”
            ○    MPC says duress is unavailable if the person was reckless or negligent in putting
                 themselves into the situation – imposing mens rea to question of getting oneself into
                 that situation

Insanity

In the criminal process, mental incapacity can be a defense to a criminal charge, or it can preclude the
guilty plea, trial, sentencing, or execution of a defendant

KEY QUESTION: What forms of mental incapacity should provide a complete defense to criminal
responsibility?

Definitions
Mental Illness: a medical term, used by clinicians, to refer to a disorder recognized by the therapeutic
community for purposes of diagnosis and treatment

Insanity: Refers to a mental state, existing at the time of a criminal offense, that is considered sufficient
to preclude criminal responsibility

Incompetence: Refers to a person’s mental state at the time of a legal proceeding
    ● A person who lacks sufficient mental capacity to understand or participate in the relevant legal
      proceeding is deemed incompetent
    ● Need to be competent to stand trial – MPC 4.04: No person who, as a result of mental disease
      or defect lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own
      defense shall be tried so long as insanity endures
          ○ Defendant must have sufficient present ability to consult with lawyer with a degree of
               rational understanding
          ○ Focus on rational and factual often neglects mood disorders

Involuntary Medication: Asks whether a defendant can be forcibly medicated to be competent to stand
trial → to uphold involuntary medication, a court must find:
     1. The government has an important interest in trying the defendant for the crime at issue
     2. Forced medication is likely to render the defendant competent and unlikely to have side effects
        that interfere with ability to assist defense counsel
     3. Alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results
     4. Treatment is in the defendant’s best medical interest in light of her condition

It is cruel and unusual punishment to execute an insane person (Ford v. Wainwright) and the 8th
Amendment forbids the execution of a person with mental retardation, even if they are not insane
under the Ford standard (Atkins v. Virginia)

§4.01 - Mental Disease or Defect Excluding Responsibility
1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental
disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his
conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law
2) As used in this Article, the terms “mental disease or defect” do not include an abnormality
manifested only be repeat criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct

Yates v. State

Take Away Questions: What sort of evidence can prove insanity? What role do experts play?

Facts: Yates drowned her five children in a bathtub in an attempt to save them from Satan

Procedural Posture: Court rejected her insanity defense despite having multiple mental health
professionals testify that she was experiencing a psychotic episode at the time of the incident

Statute: Texas §8.01
    ● Affirmative defense to prosecution that, at time the conduct was charged, actor didn't know
        conduct was wrong
    ● Term “mental disease or defect” does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated
        or otherwise antisocial conduct
Complication for defense: Mrs. Yates said certain things that showed she had knowledge of what hse
was doing and that they’d be perceived as morally wrong – appeared that she was not able to stop
herself

Appeal: Appellate court reversed on the ground that the lone expert who testified against the guilty
plea suggested she fabricated the defense based on a law and order episode about a woman who
drowned her children – no episode existed

On retrial, Yates was found not guilty by reason of insanity because the expert testimony was false

M'Naghten's Case

Takeaways
   ● Defendant is presumed sane unless proven otherwise
   ● Burden of proof for defendant:
          ○ At time of act, D was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind,
            as not to know the nature and quality of the act they were doing OR
          ○ If they did know the nature and quality of the act, they didn’t know it was wrong

Facts: D was indicted for murder of Secretary of Prime Minister – M’Naghten had gone to London to
shoot the the Prime Minister and shot the Secretary by mistake

Procedural Posture: Judge charged the jury by saying the question is whether the prisoner had use of
his understanding, so as to know what he was doing a wrong or wicked act

Issue: Whether defendant will be found not guilty by reason of insanity, if he did not know of
appreciate the nature or quality of the criminal act he committed

Holding: Yes

Rule: Those who are irresponsible under the test are plainly beyond the reach of the influence of the
law, and their condemnation would be futile and injust

Analysis
   ● Jurors ought to be told that every person is presumed to be sane and responsible for their
       crimes until the opposite is proved to their satisfaction
   ● To establish the insanity defense, need to clearly prove that, at time of committing the act, the
       accused was operating under such a defect of reason, to not know the nature or quality of the
       act being committed; or if he knew he was doing it, he would have to not know that what he
       was doing was wrong

Note on response to M’Naghten
    ●   Rule was too focused on cognition (knowing) and not whether it the defendant could control
        their behavior – too narrow of a ruling since even if the defendant knew what they were doing
        was wrong, maybe they couldn't help it
    ●   Fails to consider irresistible impulse

Blake v. United States

Facts: Blake was charged with bank robbery – was discharged from Navy after suffering an epileptic
seizure; then received psychiatric treatment and he began drinking; He robbed the bank shortly after a
legal hearing where he tried to get himself relieved of certain state prison release restrictions
    ● At trial, there was psychiatric testimony that established a severe form of mental illness
    ● Once the hypothesis of insanity was established, the burden shifted to the prosecution to
         establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Blake was sane at the time of the commission of the
         crime

Procedural Posture: Appellant urges that the definition of insanity given to the jury was outmoded
and prejudicial

Issue: Whether the trial judge charged the jury with the correct definition of insanity – should they
have used the MPC standard or the Davis Standard

Holding: The lower court should have used the “substantial capacity” standard like in the MPC

Analysis
   ● The district court charged them with the Davis definition of insanity, while the defense
       objected and proposed substituting the MPC instead
           ○ Davis: Requires an absolute loss of control – need to be unconscious, incapable of
               distinguishing right and wrong, or with a complete destruction of his will
           ○ MPC: Substantial capacity standard – person lacks substantial capacity either to
               appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform conduct with regulations of the
               law
   ● The facts, as read favorably to the government, does not show complete mental disorientation
       under the absolute standard required by Davis
   ● Court finds that he could not have prevailed under the Davis standard but might have prevailed
       under a substantial lack of capacity charge

U.S. v. Lyons

Takeway: Courts had become more punitive towards defendants with evidence of “insanity” after
Hinckley was acquitted

Facts: D was indicted for knowingly and intentionally securing controlled narcotics; suffered from
painful ailments and took narcotics as prescribed then eventually became addicted
Issue: Whether evidence of addiction supports finding of lack of substantial capacity

Holding: No, evidence of narcotic addiction alone, raises not issues of a mental illness that can serve as
a basis for the insanity defense; but withdraws recognition of volitional prong of insanity defense and
concludes that if Lyons wants to offer evidence to satisfy the cognitive prong, he can

Analysis
   ● RULE: A person is not responsible for criminal conduct on the grounds of insanity only if at
       the time of that conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he is unable to appreciate the
       wrongfulness of that conduct
   ● Court previously adopted the MPC definition of insanity in Blake, but reexamines that standard
       today – Specifically looks at Volitional prong of insanity defense (lack of capacity to conform
       conduct with requirements of the law, does not comport with current medical standards
   ● New definition: A person is not responsible for criminal conduct on grounds of insanity only if
       at the time of the conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, he is unable to appreciate
       the wrongfulness of that conduct
            ○ Psychiatrists believe that we no longer have sufficient scientific bases for measuring a
                person’s capacity or self-control
            ○ Most room for error in insanity defense when looking at substantial capacity
            ○ For people who are actually experiencing psychosis, the volitional test is redundant
                since most individuals fail the cognitive test
   ● Creates presumption that all criminal impulses are resistable

Dissent: Relies on theories of punishment
    ● Collective conscious does not allow punishment where it cannot impose blame
    ● Court rested decision to redefine insanity and to narrow the defense on “policy considerations”
            ○ Policy considerations are based on stereotypes and misunderstandings about what
                insanity actually looks like
            ○ Frequency and success rate of insanity pleas were grossly overstated by the majority –
                it is rarely made and very rarely successful
            ○ Also perception that a plea of insanity leads to release is based on an assumption which
                is false – if insanity plea is successful, it almost always leads to a hospitalization
    ● Majority based decision on a “belief held by a majority of psychiatrists” which lacks expert
        evidence


Kahler v. Kansas

Takeaway: Due process doesn’t require states to have an insanity defense (other than the defense of not
having the mens rea, which isn’t exactly the same thing)

Facts: Case is about the modified insanity-defense statute in Kansas, which provided that a criminal
defendant could offer evidence of mental illness to show that they lacked the required criminal intent,
or mental state, to commit the charged crime; Kansas law recognized a lack of cognitive capacity
regarding the nature and quality of a defendant’s conduct as a valid insanity defense
    ● Kahler murdered four people then turned himself into the police
    ● Filed a pretrial motion regarding Kansas’s treatment of the insanity defense → DP clause of
        14A requires availability of insanity defense for circumstances in which a defendant could not
        distinguish right from wrong due to mental illness

Statute: Under Kansas law, a jury can only consider mental disease or defect as a defense insofar as it
shows that the defendant lacked the mens rea required as an element to the crime

Issue Whether the due process clause of the 14th Amendment requires states to adopt the
moral-incapacity test for criminal defendants who assert an insanity defense

Holding: No, the due process clause does not require states to adopt moral-incapacity test

Analysis
   ● A state law violates DP clause if it offends some fundamental principle of justice rooted in the
       traditions and conscious of our people
   ● Kansas rejected moral-incapacity test but kept the cognitive capacity test; Kahler was able to
       offer evidence of mental illness as a mitigating circumstance of reduce moral culpability
   ● Based on his ability to offer evidence, Kansas statute does not violence due process because it
       still permits the consideration of mental illness as a complete bar to criminal liability and
       permitted evidence of mental illness to be presented at sentencing for mitigation purposes

                                     Expanding Liability
At common law, attempts were misdemeanors – Today, the usual punishment for attempt is a reduced
fraction of the punishment for the completed crime BUT some states have moved away from that, by
making the punishment the same for the attempt as for the crime attempted, unless it is a crime
punishable by life imprisonment or death

Relevant MPC Provisions:
2.06: Liability for Conduct of Another; Complicity
5.01: Criminal Attempt

Attempt

Attempt is a way of charging someone for an inchoate crime – a crime that did not lead to the intended
require

Mens Rea issue: Did you intend to commit the crime OR to engage in conduct that would have resulted
in the crime had you succeeded?
     ●    Conduct: Defendant must purposely engage in all elements of the conduct made criminal by
          the crime attempted
     ●    Result: Defendant acted with the purpose or belief that his act would cause a particular result
     ●    Circumstance: The mens rea for circumstances required by the target crime is required for an
          attempt

Actus Rectus issue: How far along in the crime must you have been? What must you have done?
NOTE: Threat alone is insufficient and the MPC requires that the actor take “a substantial step”
before being convicted of an attempt

Why criminalize attempts for reckless homicide?
  ● Some jurisdictions allow for attempted reckless homicide – Can't logically intend something
       that’s reckless, but criminal law doesn’t need to be logical, can be administration of categories
       based on beliefs about culpability
  ● Justification for attempt liability for attempted reckless homicide: Equally culpable, just moral
       luck as to result/whether someone dies → Attempt liability criminalizes actions that would
       have been criminal had they killed someone

§5.01 – Criminal Attempt

1) Definition of Attempt. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise
required for commission of the crime, he:
     a. (Conduct Crime) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances
           were as he believes them to be; or
     b. (Result crime; Mens Rea: purpose or knowledge) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or
           omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause such result without further
           conduct on his part; or
     c. (Behaving in a way that culminates in a crime) purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the
           circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct
           planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.
2) Conduct Which May Be Held Substantial Step Under Subsection (1)(c). Conduct shall not be held to constitute a
substantial step under Subsection (1)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.
Without negativing the sufficiency of other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose,
shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law:
     a. lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime;
     b. enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its
           commission;
     c. reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime;
     d. unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle or enclosure in which it is contemplated that the crime will be committed;
     e. possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, which are specially designed for such
           unlawful use or which can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;
     f. possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, at or near the place
           contemplated for its commission, where such possession, collection or fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the
           actor under the circumstances;
     g. soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime.
3) Conduct Designed to Aid Another in Commission of a Crime. A person who engages in conduct designed to aid another to
commit a crime which would establish his complicity under Section 2.06 if the crime were committed by such other person, is
guilty of an attempt to commit the crime, although the crime is not committed or attempted by such other person.
 4) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. When the actor's conduct would otherwise constitute an attempt under Subsection
(1)(b) or (1)(c) of this Section, it is an affirmative defense that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise
prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
The establishment of such defense does not, however, affect the liability of an accomplice who did not join in such
abandonment or prevention.

NOTE: Within the meaning of this Article, renunciation of criminal purpose is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in
part, by circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the actor's course of conduct, which increase the probability
of detection or apprehension or which make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose. Renunciation is not
complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the
criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.

People v. Rizzo

Facts: Rizzo and three others planned to rob a man named Charles Rao for the payroll; at the time of
arrest, neither Rao nor another man who carried the payroll were at the location of the arrest – at this
time, the defendants had not found or seen the man they intended to rob

Issue: Whether or not the steps which the defendant had taken up to the time of his arrest amounted to
the commission of a crime

Holding: The defendants were not guilty of an attempt to commit robbery since they had not found or
reached the presence of the person that they intended to rob

Analysis
   ● An act, done with intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect its commission, is
       an attempt to commit that crime
           ○ “Tending” is indefinite, but means to exert activity in a particular direction
           ○ Can say that any act in preparation to commit a crime may be said to have a tendency
               towards its accomplishment
   ● The law has recognized that there are many acts that are technically preparing to commit a
       crime, but are too remote to constitute the crime of attempt → Whether the activity leads to
       attempt depends on the proximity to the success of the crime
   ● Law has to be practical and therefore only considers acts which are so near to its
       accomplishment it’s very likely the crime would have occurred without interference
   ● Applying to this case
           ○ For it to be robbery, they would have had to take money from Rao → So the question
               is whether the acts described in the facts came dangerously close to taking Rao’s
               property
           ○ The court determines they were not → they never found him and could not make an
               attempt to rob him; the defendants planned to commit a crime, but never had the
               opportunity

Note on Proximity Test: The proximity test does not require the defendant to take the last step or do an
unequivocal act before an attempt had been committed. Instead, it allowed the jury to weigh several
factors, including:
    ●   Seriousness of the offense
    ●   Community resentment
    ●   Closeness in space and time to completing the crime

McQuirter v. State

Facts: Appellant is a Black man who was found guilty of an atttempt to commit assault with rape

Issue: Whether the trial court erred in refusing the general affirmative charge and in denying the
motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence

Holding: It was sufficient to warrant the submission of the question of the defendant’s guilt to the jury
and was ample to sustain the judgment of conviction

Analysis:
   ● To justify conviction for an attempt to commit an assault with intent to rape, the jury must be
       satisfied beyond a reasonable double that the defendant itneded to have sexual intercourse with
       the victim against their will or by putting fear in them
   ● Intent is determined by the jury based on facts and circumstances adduced in the trial
   ● To determine question of intention, jury may consider social conditions and customs founded
       upon racial differences

Note: This case shows pattern of racial discrimination against Black men who have engaged with white
women → False confessions

Equivocality Test: Looks not to how far the defendant has gone, but to actions only – if the actions of
the defendant exhibit criminal intent on their face, defendant can be punished with attempt

Complicity

Complicity: Imposes criminal responsibility on individuals for a crime committed by someone else,
usually because these secondary actors have intentionally helped or encouraged the primary actor to
commit the crime
    ● Another theory to prove a substantive crime
            ○ Not a separate crime, like attempt or conspiracy, just a way of proving that someone is
                 guilty of the substantive crime in their own name
            ○ Indictment does not say charged with aiding and abetting (the crime is not aiding and
                 abetting), indictment charges with the crime that you are aiding and abetting
    ● Accessory after the fact does not merge with the crime – responsible for being an accessory
        after the fact
    ● Same level of punishment – you are charged with the same substantive offense
    ● Principal does not need to be convicted for an accomplice to be convicted
    ● Complicity can join with attempt – Can be held with complicity if the crime wasn’t completed
        ex. Charged with attempted murder through a theory of complicity
Principles and Accessories:
    ● Principal in the First Degree (P1): Individual who personally commits the crime or uses an
       innocent agent to commit the crime
    ● Innocent Agent: Commits criminal act but lacks capacity to commit a crime or mens rea for
       the crime and is fooled or forced to commit a criminal act
    ● Principal in the Second Degree (P2): Individual who intentionally helps or encourages P1 to
       commit the crime and is actually present at the crime scene or is constructively present
    ● Accessory before the Fact (A-BTF): Someone who intentionally helps P1 beforehand, but is
       not present when P1 commits the crime
    ● Accessory after the Fact (A-AFT): Someone who, though not part of the planning or
       commission of the crime committed by P1, intentionally renders aid after the crime

Punishment
   ● Complicity or aiding and abetting is NOT a crime – accomplices get convicted of the crime
      committed by the principal
   ● The maximum punishment that can be given to an accomplice is the same maximum
      punishment as given to the principal

Actus Rectus for Complicity
   ● Aiding and Abetting
   ● Mere presence is insufficient (Hicks) – language needs to demonstrate intent (it is the intent
       that matters, not the words)
   ● Nexus: Defendant cannot be guilty of aiding and abetting if there is no connection with the
       principle who was committing the crime

Mens Rea for Complicity
Conduct: Accomplice must have as her purpose that P will engage in the conduct elements of the
objective crime
Circumstances: Seems courts may decide whether purpose as to circumstances is required for
conviction or simply the same culpability or mens rea towards circumstances as is required for object
crime
Result: MPC requires same culpability or mens rea towards the result as would be required for
conviction of P for the object offense

Withdrawal of Aid: An accomplice may withdraw previously provide assistance and avoid criminal
responsibility if he terminates his complicity before the principal commits the offense and:
    a. Completely deprives the aid of its effectiveness, or
    b. Gives timely warning to the police, or
    c. Otherwise makes a “proper effort to prevent the commission of the crime”

Note on McVay and Roebuck: there is a distinction between conduct elements nad result elements in
accomplice liability
     ●    For accomplice liability, accomplice must have specific intent to further the underlying conduct
          committed by the principle
     ●    Regarding the result, the accomplice need only have the mens rea requirement for the result
          element of the substantive offense

§2.06 - Complicity

1) A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he is
legally accountable, or both.
2) A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:
     a.     acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he causes an innocent or
           irresponsible person to engage in such conduct; or
     b. he is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by the Code or by the law defining the offense; or
     c. He is an accomplice of such other persons in the commission of the offense.
3) A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:
     a. with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he
                i.   solicits such other person to commit it; or
               ii.    aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it; or
              iii.   having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, fails to make proper effort so to do; or
     b. His conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity.
4) When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an
accomplice in the commission of that offense, if he acts with the kind of culpability, if any, with respect to that result that is
sufficient for the commission of the offense.
5) A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular offense himself may be guilty thereof if it is committed by the
conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, unless such liability is inconsistent with the purpose of the
provision establishing his incapacity.
6) Unless otherwise provided by the Code or by the law defining the offense, a person is not an accomplice in an offense
committed by another person if:
     a. he is a victim of that offense; or
     b. the offense is so defined that his conduct is inevitably incident to its commission; or
     c. he terminates his complicity prior to the commission of the offense and
                i.   wholly deprives it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense; or
               ii.   gives timely warning to the law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the
                     commission of the offense.
7) An accomplice may be convicted on proof of the commission of the offense and of his complicity therein, though the
person claimed to have committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted or has been convicted of a different
offense or degree of offense or has an immunity to prosecution or conviction or has been acquitted.

Individual States on Complicity

NYPL 20.00: When one person engages in conduct which constitutes an offense, another person is
criminally liable for such conduct when, acting with the mental culpability required for the commission
thereof, he solicits, requests, commands, importunes, or intentionally aids such person to engage in
such conduct

Illinois 720 ILCS 5/5-2: Ap person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when either before
or during the commission of an offense, and with the intent to promote or facilitate such commission,
he solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid, such other person in the planning or commission of
the offense
California Jury Instructions:
    ● Those who, with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the one who does directly and actively
        commit or attempt to commit the crime, aid and abet in its commission or who, whether present
        or not at the commission or attempt commission of the crime, advise and encourage its
        commission
    ● A person aids and abets the commission of a crime if, with knowledge of the unlawful purpose
        of the perpetrator of the crime, he aids, promotes, encourages, or instigates by act or advice the
        commission of such a crime

State v. Gladstone (roll logs!)

Takeaway: Aider and abetting does not have to be physically present at the commission of the crime to
be held as guilty as the principal, but his conviction depends on proof that he did something in
association or connection with the principal to accomplish the crime

Facts: Case involved three individuals: Thompson, Kent, and Gladstone (Defendant); Thompson was
hired by Tacoma PD to attempt to purchase weed from Gladstone; When Thompson visited Gladstone
to buy week, D said that he did not have enough os ell, but directed him to Kent to buy

Procedural Posture: Jury found defendant guilty of aiding and abetting Robert Kent in sale of
marijuana

Issue: Whether Gladstone can be charged with aiding and abetting Kent in selling marijuana to
Thompson

Holding: No, there is no evidence of a relationship between the two parties that would allow for the
inference of aiding and abetting

Analysis
   ● Case is missing the vital element between the accused the the party whom he is charged with
       aiding and abetting in the commission of a crime → no indication in the evidence that
       Gladstone encouraged Kent to sell Thompson
   ● There can be no aiding and abetting unless one associates himself with the venture, participates
       in something he wishes to bring about, and seeks, by his action, to make it succeed

State v. McVay

Takeaway: A defendant could be an accessory before the fact to an involuntary manslaughter he never
had any intention of committing through his negligent conduct (focusing on conduct)

Facts: Three indictments for manslaughter were brought against the captain of the Mackinac as
principles and against Kelley as accessory before the fact; Boiler producing steam burst and killed three
people
Issue: Whether a defendant may be indicted and convicted of being an accessory before the fact to the
crime of manslaughter arising through criminal negligence as set forth in the indictment

Holding: A jury could find that Kelley, knowing the possible danger to human life, recklessly and
willfully advised the captain to take a chance by negligent action or failure to act

Analysis
   ● Kelley contends that since manslaughter is “without malice” and “involuntary” , eh cannot be
       legally indicted → Since manslaughter is sudden and unpremeditated, it cannot be maliciously
       incited before the crime is committed
   ● Court agrees that there can be no accessory before the fact when killing results from sudden
       and unpremeditated blow, you cannot broadly state that premeditation is inconsistent with
       every charge of manslaughter
   ● RULE: There is no inherent reason why, prior to the commission of such a crime, on may not
       aid, abet, counsel, command, or procure the doing of the unlawful act or the lawful act in an
       negligent manner
   ● Kelley could have intentionally directed and counseled the grossly negligent act which resulted
       in the crime

Commonwealth v. Roebuck

Takeaway: Accomplice need not always intend the result of the underlying crime; No intention is
required to be considered extremely reckless

Facts: Victim was lured to apartment complex where he was ambushed, shot, and mortally wounded –
appellant participated in organizing the events, but did not shoot the victim

Procedural Posture: Appellant was found guilty at a bench trial – argued that accomplice liability
attaches only when the defendant intends to facilitate or promote an underlying offense; since 3rd
degree murder is an unintentionally killing committed with malice, finding someone as an accomplice
would be to accept that the accused intended to aid an unintentional act

Relevant Statute: PA Statute mirrors MPC §2.06(4): When causing a particular result is an element of
an offense, an accomplice in the conduct causing such a result is an accomplice in the commission of
that offense, if he acts with the kind of culpability, with respect to that result, that is sufficient for the
commission of the offense

Issue: Whether it is possible, as a matter of law, to be convicted as an accomplice to third-degree
murder

Holding: Yes, it is possible

Analysis
    ●   State argues that accomplice liability applies to murder in the third degree because the shared
        criminal intent motivates the conduct, which establishes criminal culpability
    ●   Mens Rea provisions for accomplice (MPC): “Accomplice in conduct” and acts with the mens
        rea sufficient for commission of the underlying offense
            ○ “Commission of offense” focuses on conduct, not the result → Accomplice does not
                 have to intend the results essential to completed crime
            ○ Accomplice is held accountable for contributing to conduct to the degree his
                 culpability equals what is required to support liability of principal actor
    ●   It Roebuck intended to engage in the conduct that led to the death, it doesn’t matter that he
        didn’t intend the death/to shoot, IF he was extremely reckless with the result

Concurrence: Accomplice to third degree murder does not intend to aid in intentional murder, instead
he intends to aid a malicious act which results in a killing

People v. Luparello

Takeaway: Foreseeable consequences doctrine – Liability is extended to reach the actual crime
committed, rather than the planned crime on the policy that aiders and abettors should be responsible
for the criminal harms they have foreseeably put in motion

Facts: D wanted to find former partner who left him for someone else and enlisted the help of friends
to find her and said he “wanted the information at any cost” – when his friends visited a friend of the
new husband to get information, they failed, so returned later, armed with a gun (without D) and shot
him

Procedural Posture: Luparello was convicted of murder – guilt was partially attached to aiding and
abetting; on appeal, D argues that the murder was the unplanned and unintended act of a co-conspirator,
and therefore is not chargeable to Luparello under complicity theory

Issue: Whether a defendant can be charged under the complicity theory for an unplanned and
unintended act of a co-conspirator

Holding: The aiding and abetting theory in this case provides a sound basis to derive Luparello’s
criminal responsibility for first-degree murder

Analysis
   ● Luperaello incorrectly claims that the perpetrator and accomplice must share an identical intent
       to be found criminally responsible for the same crime → Accomplice liability is actually
       premised on an equivalent mens rea
   ● For an aider and abettor, liability is extended to reach the actual crime committed, rather than
       the planned or “intended crime” on the police that aiders and abettors should be held
       responsible for the criminal harms that they have naturally, probably, and foreseeably put in
       motion
    ●   RULE: Per CA Supreme Court – for aider and abettor, liability is vicarious: guilty of the events
        he intended to facilitate or encourage, but also of any reasonably foreseeable offense
        committed by the person he aids and abets




Conspiracy

Conspiracy is generally defined as the crime of agreeing with another to commit a criminal offense – A
separate crime of conspiracy: Working with others to commit a crime

Three types of liability in conspiracy law:
   1. Conspiracy: a separate crime/ “crime to itself” that attaches to the underlying substantive
       offenses that are a part of the conspiracy
           a. Substantive acts don’t need to be completed to be charged with conspiracy (Inchoate
                crime)
           b. One charge is for conspiring to engage in criminal activity and one is for the criminal
                activity you conspired to commit – defendant can be charged convicted of both if the
                substantive acts you agreed to do were completed
   2. Liability for substantive crimes
   3. Accomplice liability – substantive liability for crimes your conspirators committed
           a. Can be held substantially liable for someone else’s crime because you were a
                conspirator, even though you may not have necessarily participated in that crime/if that
                crime wasn’t an explicit part of the conspiracy (Pinkerton)
           b. BUT here is merges – you’d be charged with the substantive offense, liable under a
                conspiracy theory

PLUS: a possible theory of substantive responsibility for crimes committed by others: Conspiratorial
accomplice liability (Pinkerton) – Conspiracy can create accomplice liability
    ● Being held substantively liable for someone else's crime because you were a conspirator, even
       though you might not have necessarily participated in that crime
    ● Merges so that effectively, the charge will be the offense (the actual crime that someone else
       committed) you’d be guilty of that other crime through

Punishment for Conspiracy
Under MPC, the punishment for conspiracy is the same grade and degree as the most serious object
crime, except that a conspiracy to commit a capital offense or a felony of the first degree is punished as
felony of the second degree

Conspiracy: Benefits to the State and Prosecutor
    ●    Hearsay Evidence + Bootstrapping: Ability to confront the defendant with a long list of acts
         and statements by others that he may not have authorized or known about but are still likely to
         influence the jury
    ●    Joint trials/joinder: Makes it difficult for defendant to make his own case stand on its merits
         before the jurors
    ●    Location of trial: Discretion on location of trial; case can be tried in any district where any of
         the conspirators did any of the acts intended to accomplish the object of the conspiracy
    ●    Statute of limitations
    ●    Cumulative punishment
    ●    Pinkerton Rule – expanded scope of liability

Actus Rectus:
   ● Agreement (Interstate Circuit) to commit a crime, with a shared determination to accomplish a
       goal plus an overt act (MPC §5.03 unless first or second degree felony)
   ● Standards for proving an agreement:
           ○ Does not need to be express
           ○ Proof may be circumstantial and inferential
           ○ Defendant does not have to know all the details or phases of the conspiracy, just needs
               to know of its essential nature
           ○ All participants do not need to know each other
           ○ Defendant just needs to know that the conspiracy involves a broader scope and wider
               organization
   ● An inference of an agreement is permissible only when the nature of the acts would logically
       require coordination and planning
   ● Often requirement of an “overt act” towards the commission of the conspiracy
           ○ Some expectation for most heinous felony
           ○ Earlier common law didn’t requirement this, fact of agreement was enough

Mens Rea:
  ● MPC requires knowledge in conspiracy cases
  ● Most states also require intent or inferred intent (See Lauria), rather than mere knowledge,
      even when the object crime is a serious felony – mere approval of another’s participation in a
      criminal purpose is not enough


Once you are part of a conspiracy, the only way to get out of it is to step away from it and actively try
to stop it (§5.03.6)

§5.03 - Criminal Conspiracy

1) Definition of Conspiracy. A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the
purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission he:
    a. agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes
          such crime or an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime; or
     b.     agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or commission of such crime or of an attempt or
           solicitation to commit such crime.
2) Scope of Conspiratorial Relationship. If a person guilty of conspiracy, as defined by Subsection (1) of this Section, knows
that a person with whom he conspired to commit a crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same
crime, he is guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not he knows their identity, to commit such
crime.
3) Conspiracy With Multiple Criminal Objectives. If a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only
one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.
4) Joinder and Venue in Conspiracy Prosecutions.
      a.    Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Subsection, two or more persons charged with criminal conspiracy
           may be prosecuted jointly if:
               i.      they are charged with conspiring with one another; or
              ii.     The conspiracies alleged, whether they have the same or different parties, are so related that they
                      constitute different aspects of a scheme of organized criminal conduct.
      b. In any joint prosecution under paragraph (a) of this Subsection:
               i.     no defendant shall be charged with a conspiracy in any county [parish or district] other than one in which
                      he entered into such conspiracy or in which an overt act pursuant to such conspiracy was done by him or
                      by a person with whom he conspired; and
              ii.     neither the liability of any defendant nor the admissibility against him of evidence of acts or declarations
                      of another shall be enlarged by such joinder; and
             iii.     the Court shall order a severance or take a special verdict as to any defendant who so requests, if it deems
                      it necessary or appropriate to promote the fair determination of his guilt or innocence, and shall take any
                      other proper measures to protect the fairness of the trial.
5) Overt Act. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime, other than a felony of the first or second degree,
unless an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom
he conspired.
6) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. It is an affirmative defense that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted
the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
7) Duration of Conspiracy. For purposes of Section 1.06(4):
      a. conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when the crime or crimes which are its object are
           committed or the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he
           conspired; and
      b. such abandonment is presumed if neither the defendant nor anyone with whom he conspired does any overt act in
           pursuance of the conspiracy during the applicable period of limitation; and
      c. If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him only if and when he advises those
           with whom he conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the
           conspiracy and of his participation therein.

Interstate Circuit v. U.S.

Takeaway: Agreement needed for conspiracy can be implied/inferred from the circumstantial evidence
– there doesn’ tneed to be direct evidence of simultaneous agreement
“It is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be, and often is, forward without simultaneous action
or agreement on the part of the conspirators”

Facts: Two movie theater chains (Interstate and Consolidated) which entered into deals with various
movie distributors
   ● Independent contracts provided that the distributor agreed to two terms:
            ○  On subsequent runs, the theater has to charge more than 25 cents – if you want to work
               with us (the theaters), you have to ensure that other movie theaters have to charge more
               on a subsequent run
           ○ Distribution companies cannot allow the first run films to be shown on a double bill
               with another feature film
    ●   Contractors agree and were ultimately charged with a violation of the Sherman Act

Issue: Whether under §1 of the Sherman Act, an agreement to participate in a conspiracy may be
inferred from the course of conduct of the alleged co-conspirators

Holding: Yes, a conspiracy can be inferred from behavior of co-conspirators because each of the
distributors knew that the others ha received the letter and because concerted action of all was
necessary for the price-fixing to be effective

Analysis
   ● Direct evidence of agreement to participate in unlawful conspiracy is often unavailable →
       Need to be able to inferred conspiracy from course of conduct
   ● In this case, each distributor agreed with one another to take the same action and agreed to
       Interstate’s demands
           ○ Once the letter was received, each distributor knew that the other distributors were
                considering the demands
           ○ All distributors were in competition, so without uniform action with respect to the
                demands, there was a risk of substantial loss of business and good will
           ○ Agreeing could lead to an increase in profits, meaning there was strong incentive for
                coordinated action
   ● It is sufficient that the distributors knew that concerted action was contemplated and invited
       and each gave its adherence to the scheme and participating in it
   ● Distributors knew that if the plan was carried out, it would result in the unlawful restraint of
       commerce in violation of the ShermanAct

People v. Lauria

Takeaway: Intent can sometimes be inferred from knowledge BUT with respect to misdemeanors,
knowledge that his products are being used for criminal purpose does not, without more, constitute
intent to participate in the substantive crime (holding leaves it open re: felonies)

Facts: Police were investigating call-girl activity and focused on three sex workers plying their trade
using Lauria’s telephone answering service
    ● During a UC investigation, Lauria said that his business was taking messages
    ● Lauria was arrested and during his arrest said that he always cooperated with the police, ahd
        very few sex workers on his board, and kept separate records for known or suspected sex
        workers for the convenience of the police
    ●   While Lauria cooperated with the police, he only shared records if the police had a specific
        name – didn’t arbitrarily tell police about people on the board, but admitted that he knew some
        of his customers were sex workers




Standard: To Establish agreement, the People need to show no more than a tacit, mutual understanding
between co-conspirators to accomplish an unlawful act

Issue: Whether a supplier becomes part of a conspiracy to further an illegal enterprise by furnishing
goods or services which he knees are to be used by the buyer for criminal purposes
Asking if he agreed to be a part of the conspiracy – the state is trying to imply agreement through the
use of an analysis of mens rea (this is weird)

Holding: Positive knowledge of the supplier that his products or services are being used from criminal
purposes does not, without more, establish an intent of the supplier to participate in the misdemeanors

Analysis
   ● Court looks at two cases with similar themes that were decided in different ways
           ○ Distinction between the two cases appears to be that distributors of dangerous
              products, like drugs, are required to exercise greater discrimination in the conduct of
              their business than are distributors of innocuous substances like sugar and yeast
           ○ When it is a felony or of higher level, knowledge can lead to an inference of intent –
              ex. If it was to sell heroin, his knowledge of it would be considered intent
   ● Elements required to establish criminal liability for supplier of lawful goods or services put to
       unlawful use:
           ○ Knowledge of illegal use of the goods and services – question of fact
            ○   Intent to further that use
                    ■ When direct evidence of participation is available, it is easy to establish intent
                    ■ Without direct evidence, intent must be derived from sale itself and its
                         surrounding circumstances to establish agreement
    ●   Court finds 3 ways to establish intent
           ○ Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the purveyor of legal goods for illegal
                use has acquired a stake in the venture – Lauria does not fit this category
           ○ Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when no legitimate use for goods or services
                exists – Lauria does not fit here, since there are legitimate uses for his services
           ○ Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the volume of business with the buyer is
                grossly disproportionate to any legitimate demand, or when sales for illegal use
                amount to a high proportion of the sellers total business – no evidence was presented
                about this at trial
    ●   Court reserves on the answer to the felony, but it seems like the felony would infer intent

Pinkerton v. U.S.

Takeaway: Expanding the scope of conspiracy liability:
   1) You are liable for the acts of a co-conspirator, regardless of whether those acts were part of the
      the greed upon conspiracy (conspiratorial complicitly) – if those acts were part of the agreed
      upon conspiracy, you don’t need to get to Pinkerton liability
   2) Broad scope + Duration: conspiracy extends even though Daniel is incarcerated
          a) Court finds a “continuous conspiracy” because Daniel didn’t withdraw from the
              conspiracy – even though he is incarcerated
          b) Highlights other ways prosecutors in jurisdictions that reject Pinkerton can get
              Pinkerton-like liability (Alvarez: Reasonable foreseeability)

Facts: Two brothers, one of whom was incarcerated during a portion of the incident; Being charged
with violated IRS – bootleggers

Procedural Posture: Appealing the submission of the question to the jury – Jury was charged on the
theory that each petitioner could be found guilty of the substantive offenses, if it was found at the time
those offenses were committed the petitioners were parties of an unlawful conspiracy and the
substantive offense charged were in fact committed in furtherance of

Issue: Whether there was insufficient evidence available to implicate Daniel The less involved brother)
in the conspiracy

Holding: Yes, there was sufficient evidence to submit the issue to the jury, but not sufficient evidence
to show that Daniel directly participated in the commission of the substantive offenses on which the
conviction was sustained

Analysis
    ●   If two or more individuals conspire to commit illegal acts, the criminal intent to commit the
        substantive offenses has been achieved, regardless of who actually commits the illegal
        substantive offenses
    ●   Daniel relies on U.S. v. Sall where court held that evidence of direct participation in
        commission of substantive offense or evidence that participation could be fairly inferred was
        necessary ⇒ Court disagrees
    ●   There was no evidence that Daniel took the affirmative action required to withdraw from the
        conspiracy
             ○ Once you’ve joined an unlawful scheme, you have to take affirmative action to
                disavow or defeat the purpose of it
             ○ If the offense was not terminated or accomplished, it is a continuous conspiracy so you
                are still offending if you have not disavowed
             ○ As long as the partnership in crime continues, the partners act for each other in
                carrying it forward
    ●   The evidence shows that the illegal acts committed by Walter were done in furtherance of an
        unlawful agreement between Wlater and Daniel → the unlawful agreement contemplated
        precisely what was subsequently accomplished

Dissent: No evidence exists to establish that Daniel participated, or aided and abetted in the substantive
offenses – Daniel was in prison at the time of some of the crimes committed by Walter; Majority
creates a dangerous precedent that allows an ignorant and passive member of a conspiracy to be
convicted of all substantive crimes committed by a co conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy

State v. Bridges

Takeaway: Co-conspirator can be liable for the commission of substantive criminal acts that are not
within the scope of the conspiracy if they are reasonably foreseeable as the necessary or natural
consequences of the conspiracy

Facts: A birthday party, D got into a heated argument with another guest; left the party yelled and got
two friends to accompany him back to the party with weapons in expectation of a confrontation; during
the confrontation, one of the friends fired into the crowd, fatally wounding one of the onlookers

Procedural Posture: At trial, D was convicted of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault as well as
several substantive crimes - was found guilty of murder count; Appellate division reversed, finding that
D was not responsible for murder committed by acquaintances

Issue: Whether a co conspirator may be held criminally liable for substantive crimes occurring during a
conspiracy if those crimes are foreseeable as necessary or natural consequences of the conspiracy

Holding: Yes – A co-conspirator may be held liable for the commission of substantive criminal acts
that are not within the scope of the conspiracy if they are reasonably foreseeable as the necessary or
natural consequences of the conspiracy
Analysis
   ● Appellate division read Pinkerton as mandating that a crime must have been within the
       co-conspirators contemplation when he entered into the agreement → Supreme Court
       disagrees:
           ○ Pinkerton imposes vicarious liability on each conspirator for the acts of other based on
               a standard of reasonable foreseeability
           ○ Understood that liability of a co-conspirator under the objective standard of reasonable
               foreseeability would be broader than that of an accomplice, where the defendant must
               actually foresee and intend the results of his or her acts
   ● Conspiracy did not have objective of purposefully killing another person, but bringing loaded
       guns toa party has the foreseeable consequence that a weapon might be fired at the crowd

Concurrence/Dissent:
   ● Majority opinion could lead to the imposition of a life sentence on the basis of the negligent
      appraisal of a risk that another would commit a homicide
   ● Committing a murder was not a part of the conspirators plan and D lacks the mens rea to be
      found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder

State v. Alvarez

Alvarez expanded Pinkerton liability: Pinkerton liability attaches for the reasonably foreseeable (within
scope of agreement, though originally unintended), consequence of the conspiracy

In Alvarez, the evidence that supports the idea that murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence
of the conspiracy is:
     1. Substantial amount of drugs and money
     2. Jury can infer that when there’s a lot of drugs and money, a co-conspirator is likely to carry
         weapons that could be used for deadly force



                                    Seditious Conspiracy
Oath Keepers Case: Stewart Rhodes

Five Counts against Rhodes:
    1. Seditious Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. §2384)
           a. Elements:
                   i.  Multiple people
                  ii.  Conspire to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of the laws (transfer of
                       presidential power) – mens rea re: agreement: intent
                 iii.  By force
           b. A VERY broad charge (“means what they want it to mean” -Tom Durkin)
    2. Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding (18 U.S.C §1512(k))
    3. Obstruction of an official proceeding – aiding and abetting (18 U.S.C. §1512(c)(2))
    4. Conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging any duties (18 U.S.C. §372)
    5. Tampering with documents or proceedings (18 U.S.C. 1512 c (1))

   Conclusion – How the Criminal Law Constructs and Maintains the
                    Social Order that we Live in
The State v. Clarissa (enslaved person)

Takeaway: This case shows that conversations about Miranda Rights, forced confessions, and racial
dynamics were occurring for a long time before those rules came into effect
   ● Impossibility of fact re: attempt – prosecutor must prove the weed in question is a poison and
       that must be alleged in the indictment
   ● Awareness of social conditions – court decides that they need to be even more careful in the
       case of an enslaved person because of the relations of power

Facts: An attempted poisoning – alleged that Clarissa (an enslaved person) slowly poisoned her
enslaver
    ● Clarissa confessed to poisoning during torture and her mother was tortured into confessing
        after originally denying the charge

Procedural Posture:
   ● Propriety of the indictment: Indictment was inadequate – no allegation that Jamestown weed
       was a poison; defective indictment
   ● Re: law of attempt: The weed would have to be poison for the act to be attempt; belief that it is
       poison and intent to murder is not sufficient if the act will never actually poison someone

Holding:
Court reverses on grounds that indictment is inadequate – did not specify that the weed was poison

Analysis
   ● Clarissa’s counsel asked grand jury as they came in if they had any pre-formed notions about
       the case
   ● Clarissa had confessed to po
   ● Need to allege that poison is an element in the indictment – court finds that attempt to po
   ● Court concluded that there was no evidence that it was a deadly substance
   ● Court calls into question the ability of an enslaved person to make a confession of guilt without
       coercion based on the social dynamics/relations of power

Court ends decision with sentence “the humane policy of our law would exclude such evidence coming
from a white person, and the reason is much stronger for excluding it for an enslaved person”

State v. Wyatt
Facts: Wyatt wants to speak to his enslaver after he is accused of burning down the gin house; Wyatt is
tortured and told that his denials will only make matters worse – he confesses; he also confesses in
front of justice of the peace

Procedural Posture: Convicted and sentenced to death; Issue on appeal: Admissibility of confession to
justice of the peace while his enslaver is present

Holding: Confession is inadmissible – fear of punishment by enslaver if Wyatt recanted, since enslaver
was in the room; plus, judge did not tell Wyatt that he was under no obligation to confess; tainted
confession, no longer voluntary because still under looming threat of violence

Reasoning
   ● Holding from Clarissa
   ● Rules of interrogation

Chariot Race

Takeaway: The race was about displaying/reinforcing the social order NOT figuring out who was
faster, BUT through his act of avowal, he then reifies that order (Shows internalization of social order,
which may be stronger than the chiefs imposing it on him)

The same thing happened in the cases of Clarissa and Wyatt – upholding a system through legal rules

As we have learned about the law, we have often ignored the political economy of mass incarceration –
Antilicus doesn’t see how he’s implicating himself in the social order; everything we do in the law is
directly related to social order – underneath it is all about relations of power

The law is about relations of power – we implicate ourselves in those relations by how we lawyer
