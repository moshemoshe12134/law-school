# Sources Index (What to Use for What)

## Core Sources (default retrieval order for prep)
- `Admin/Sources/Source_Material/syllabus/Harcourt Criminal Law Syllabus 2026.pdf` — canonical assignments + professor prompts.
- `Admin/Syllabus/Class_Schedule.csv` — machine-friendly class list (generated).
- `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/` — per-class assignment blocks (generated).
- `Admin/Sources/Source_Material/Core Sources/Dresslers_Criminal_Law_Third_Edition_Black_Letter_Outline_Dressler.txt` — fast doctrine scaffolding (use for elements + CL/MPC contrasts).
- `Admin/Sources/Source_Material/Core Sources/Criminal_law_keyed_to_Kadish_et_al_High_Court_Case_Summaries_2014.txt` — quick case anchors and hypo-able fact patterns.
- `Admin/Sources/Source_Material/Core Sources/Criminal_Law_and_its_Processes_Kadish_et_al.txt` — use selectively: assigned cases/notes and professor-favored themes.

## Policy / Theory (Harcourt co-primary)
- `Admin/Sources/Source_Material/Core Sources/Discipline_and_Punish_Foucault.txt` — early-course theory framing (expect discussion + policy exam angles).
- `Admin/Sources/Source_Material/Core Sources/Just_Mercy_Summary_and_Analysis.txt` — course framing + justice lens (Class 1).
- `Admin/Sources/Source_Material/Supplement/` — other policy/theory supplements assigned in the syllabus (must read when assigned).

## Past Materials (priors; must be verified against Harcourt)
- `Exams/Past_Exams/` — understand exam question types early; build “Exam Spec”.
- `Admin/Sources/Past_Outlines/` — use as topic-priority hints; do not copy; reconcile with what Harcourt emphasizes in class.
