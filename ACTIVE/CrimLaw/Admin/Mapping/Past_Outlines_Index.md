## Key Harcourt-Specific Patterns (from Past Outlines)

1. **MPC-centric**: Heavy emphasis on MPC provisions; students should know section numbers
2. **Statutory modification**: Harcourt may modify statutes on exams; read carefully
3. **Mens rea default**: If not specified, presume recklessness or above
4. **EED emphasis**: Extreme Emotional Disturbance particularly important
5. **Multiple charges**: Can charge same defendant with multiple crimes based on different victims/effects
6. **Prosecution/Defense structure**: Exam answers should follow charge → defense → response format
7. **Policy + Doctrine**: Both matter significantly (50/50 based on 2006 exam)
