## Metadata & Structure
- [ ] Document header has all required fields: `doc_type`, `class_number`, `date`, `title`, `status`, `time_budget_minutes`
- [ ] All source paths in `inputs` section are correct (test by attempting file read)
- [ ] Notes section documents any sources that are incomplete/partial

## Outcome Targets (Section 0)
- [ ] 5-8 clear, measurable learning outcomes (use "By the end of prep, I can...")
- [ ] Outcomes align with assignment questions in syllabus
- [ ] Outcomes are verifiable by cold-call scenarios

## Assignment Snapshot (Section 1)
- [ ] Syllabus extract file path is correct
- [ ] Reading triage explicitly states: "Must read" vs. "Optional" for each source
- [ ] Reading triage matches actual syllabus extract (no invented readings)
- [ ] Notes explain any ambiguities in assignment

## Black Letter Rules / Parsing (Section 2)
- [ ] MPC sections parsed word-by-word if assigned (no paraphrasing without original text)
- [ ] Common law rule clearly distinguished from MPC rule
- [ ] Elements broken down with bullet points
- [ ] Mens rea attachment per element (if applicable) is explicit
- [ ] Ambiguities and line-drawing questions are identified
- [ ] Quick hypo triggers included

**Special attention:**
- [ ] If MPC assigned: Section numbers match syllabus exactly
- [ ] If cases assigned: Key fact patterns and holdings are accurate (spot-check against KSSB)

## Cases (Section 3+)
- [ ] Each assigned case has a brief: Facts → Issue → Holding → Rule → Reasoning → Policy → Cold-call takeaway → Exam angle
- [ ] Facts are accurate (especially names, dates, key details)
- [ ] Holdings are stated as YES/NO (not as narrative)
- [ ] Reasoning bullets are concise and numbered
- [ ] Policy values clearly stated (retribution vs. utilitarian, etc.)
- [ ] "Cold-call ready takeaway" is one sentence max
- [ ] "How it will be tested" anticipates exam angles

## Assigned Questions / Hypos (Section 4)
- [ ] Each question from syllabus assignment is answered
- [ ] Answers use consistent structure: Charge → Elements → Rule → Apply → Conclusion
- [ ] Prosecution and defense best arguments are both stated
- [ ] Conclusion is confident (not wishy-washy)
- [ ] At least 2-3 hypos are fully worked out

## Common Exam Traps (Section 5)
- [ ] 3-5 traps identified specific to this class topic
- [ ] Each trap includes: "what not to do" + "how to avoid it"
- [ ] Traps reference specific cases or rules from this class

## Key Takeaways (Section 6)
- [ ] 5-10 bullets
- [ ] Bullets are memorable phrases (not full sentences)
- [ ] Takeaways can be recited aloud in 60 seconds

## Notes for Class Discussion (Section 7)
- [ ] "Why this rule?" section includes 3+ policy frameworks (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, admin feasibility, fairness, etc.)
- [ ] 30-second doctrine summary is 2-4 sentences and can be memorized
- [ ] Policy arguments cite cases/reasoning from the reading

## Outline Integration (CRITICAL)
- [ ] References to past outline sections included (e.g., "See Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md line 318-325 on recklessness")
- [ ] Outline comparison table present if relevant (What did past student emphasis? Does it match Harcourt's current reading?)
- [ ] Conflicts between past outline and current assignment are flagged (e.g., "Past outline emphasizes X; current assignment emphasizes Y")
- [ ] Harcourt-specific notes from past outline are highlighted (e.g., "HARCOURT LOVES THIS re: EED")

## MPC/Statute Integration (if applicable)
- [ ] Verbatim text of all cited MPC sections included
- [ ] Verbatim text of all cited statutes included (from KSSB or assignment)
- [ ] Cross-references to other MPC sections noted (e.g., "§2.02(4) distribution rule applies here")
- [ ] Interpretive gaps identified (e.g., "MPC silent on X; common law splits on X")

## No Errors / Accuracy Check
- [ ] No obvious typos or formatting errors
- [ ] Citations are consistent format (e.g., "KSSB10 p. 123" not "KSSB p. 123")
- [ ] Case names match assigned reading (especially in hypos)
- [ ] Page numbers in casebook match actual KSSB edition

## Exam Alignment
- [ ] Prep anticipates Harcourt's exam style (based on Exam_Spec.md and past outlines)
- [ ] Heavy emphasis on policy + doctrine (50/50 split)
- [ ] Multiple charge scenarios practiced (not just single charge)
- [ ] Prosecution/defense framework integrated
- [ ] Statutory modification risk flagged (Harcourt may alter statutes on exam)

## Master_Log Column Mapping

When QC passes, update Master_Log:

- `Outline Updated`: Mark "Y" if outline sections were referenced/integrated
- `Last Touched`: Update to QC date
- `Next Action`: Change to "Review" or "Next Class Prep"
