# Crim Law Prep Sheet Architecture (Per Class)

**Purpose:** Produce a single, readable prep sheet per class that lets you walk into class fully prepared (cold calls + policy + hypos), using *all* assigned sources (casebook/textbook, statutes, MPC excerpts, professor notes/slides, and past-year outlines).

---

## How To Use This Template (Workflow)

1. **Collect sources for Class [N]**
   - Casebook pages / cases (primary).
   - Statute(s) assigned (primary).
   - MPC provision(s) assigned (primary).
   - Professor slides/handout/notes (authoritative for what matters in class).
   - Past-year outlines (secondary, but critical for emphasis + exam focus).
2. **Extract “exam rules” + “discussion moves”**
   - Exam rules = elements, mens rea, defenses, burdens, standards, splits.
   - Discussion moves = policy arguments, competing rationales, fairness/admin concerns, “why this rule.”
3. **Synthesize**
   - Turn multiple sources into one clean rule statement + application steps.
   - Flag conflicts (case vs. outline vs. professor) and resolve in favor of professor/materials.
4. **Answer assigned questions/hypos**
   - Use a consistent analysis structure (elements → apply → counterarguments → conclusion).
5. **End with a “walk-in ready” checklist**
   - What you can say if cold-called on each case/doctrine.
   - The two best policy arguments on each side.
   - The common exam traps.

```markdown
# Class [N] Prep Sheet: [Topic Title]

**Course:** Criminal Law
**Topic:** [Unit / Doctrine]
**Date:** [Semester/Year]
**Reading:** [Casebook pp. __–__]; [Cases]; [Statutes]; [MPC §__]

## Key Concepts Overview (What This Class Is Really About)

### The Big Picture (3–6 bullets)
- [What doctrine/tool we’re learning]
- [What problem it solves / what tradeoff it reflects]
- [Where it fits in the course map (e.g., actus reus → mens rea → causation → defenses)]

### Vocabulary You Must Be Able to Define (fast)
- **[Term]** = ...
- **[Term]** = ...

### Core Framework / Decision Tree
1. [Step 1: Identify charge/offense]
2. [Step 2: Elements + mens rea by element]
3. [Step 3: Causation (if relevant)]
4. [Step 4: Defenses (if relevant)]
5. [Step 5: Burdens + standard of proof]

## Crim Law Add-Ons (Use When the Reading Is Heavy)

### A. “Rule Synthesis” Table (Best for casebook-heavy classes)

| Doctrine | Common law baseline | MPC baseline | Leading case(s) | Professor emphasis / exam note |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
|          |                     |              |                 |                                |

### B. Elements + Mens Rea by Element (Prevents sloppy answers)

For each offense you discuss, write it like this:

```markdown
**Offense: [Name]**
- **Actus reus:** ...
- **Mens rea (for actus reus):** ...
- **Result element (if any):** ...
- **Mens rea (for result):** ...
- **Circumstance element(s):** ...
- **Mens rea (for circumstance):** ...
```

### C. Burdens + Standards (Always include)

Write explicitly:

- **Prosecution must prove:** [elements] **beyond a reasonable doubt**.
- **Defense must produce evidence of:** [defense] (burden of production).
- **Defense must persuade / prosecution must disprove:** [varies by jurisdiction; state the rule for your class].

### D. Hypos: Fast “IRAC-for-Crim”

When analyzing a hypo, your default order is:

1. Identify **all plausible charges** (don’t pick just one too early).
2. For each charge: elements → mens rea by element → causation → defenses.
3. State the **best arguments both sides**.
4. Finish with **a confident conclusion** (even if uncertain).

---

## Source Hierarchy (When Sources Conflict)

1. **Professor statements / slides / in-class holdings** (highest).
2. **Assigned primary law** (cases + statutes + MPC excerpt).
3. **Casebook notes and questions** (important for discussion).
4. **Past-year outlines** (great for emphasis/organization; not authoritative).
5. **Commercial supplements** (last resort; only if assigned/allowed).

**Rule:** If an outline says X but the professor teaches Y, write Y and add a note: “outline says X; prof says Y.”

---

## Minimum “Fully Prepared” Checklist (Per Class)

You are done only if you can do all of the following without looking:

- Give a **1–2 sentence holding + rule** for each assigned case.
- State the **elements** of the doctrine/offense and the **mens rea** for each element.
- Explain **one strong policy argument** for each side of the doctrinal dispute.
- Work through at least **one hypo** cleanly (charges → elements → defenses → conclusion).
- Identify the **likely exam angle** (what the professor is really testing).
