             NB: The new “current context” from KSSB11 is on Courseworks. Please read that
             updated version. It is more “current.”

             KSSB10         565-573         Gregg v. Georgia
             [KSSB9         535-542]
             [KSSB11        1172-1183]
             Memo introducing David Wilson (on Courseworks)

      Notice the discussion of theories of punishment in Gregg and how it ties back to our
      discussions of deterrence and retribution in the theories of punishment.
      Also, as you read Gregg, please ask yourself: What are the guiding principles that the
      majority of the Supreme Court identify as central to maintaining the constitutionality of
      capital punishment in the United States?

             2. Modern Jurisprudence
