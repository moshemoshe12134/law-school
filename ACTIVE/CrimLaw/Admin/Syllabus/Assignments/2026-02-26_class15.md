## Syllabus Extract (verbatim-ish)

B. Race and the Death Penalty                   [#15 – THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2026]
                KSSB10          590-602         McCleskey v. Kemp
                [KSSB9          557-569]
                [KSSB11         1192-1205]

                Charles R. Lawrence III, “The Id, the Ego, and Equal Protection: Reckoning with
                Unconscious Racism, 39 Stanford Law Review 317-388 (1987). (excerpts)
                Optional additional reading:
                Robert Tsai, “After McCleskey,” Southern California Law Review (2023).

        As you read the Lawrence article, please think about how we might find ways around the
        constitutional holding in McCleskey in order to properly address racial discrimination in
        the criminal legal ordeal.

VII.    SEXUAL ASSAULT

This week, we will read and discuss the law of sexual assault. It is an area of the law that is
extremely important, but may be difficult for some of you because of your personal experiences. I
try to keep the discussion as legal and professional as possible to avoid the possibility of triggering.
I tend to focus on the legal elements of a sexual assault charge to show the way in which changes
over time regarding one element (for example, consent) will cause changes regarding other
elements (for instance, mens rea), in order to show how elements of a charge are interrelated and
can change over time. Sexual assault law is unique in this respect and therefore allows for a
demonstration of how law evolves and elements change over time. I use a table of possible
definitions of elements, which I will refer to throughout our discussion, and which I attach here as
well:
