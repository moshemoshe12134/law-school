           KSSB10          462-485        Girouard, Maher, and Casassa
           [KSSB9          437-463]       (read cases, skim notes)

As you read these materials on homicide, I would like you to be thinking about them at two
levels. The first is the technical, legal level of mapping out the elements of homicide in each
of these cases and in each of the statutes. Ask yourself:
   •    What are the element requirements necessary to convict?
   •    How do the mens rea elements attach to the different act requirements?
   •    Can you map this out in a way that will let you easily write the jury instructions?
   •    Write a jury instruction for any of these cases.
The second is the theoretical level regarding the judgments that are hidden in these different
rules and gradations. Here I would like you to ask yourself:
    •   What does it mean for a legal code to reveal something about our culture?
    •   What do these cases and codes actually expose about our moral judgements?
    •   How are those moral judgements hidden in these cases and codes? Are they?
