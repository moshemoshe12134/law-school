# Class #19 — Tuesday, 2026-03-31 — Self-defense

## Syllabus Extract (verbatim-ish)

A. Self-defense                                       [#19 – TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 2026]
In this class, we will explore the law of self-defense, focusing on the Bernie Goetz case in New
York City and on the issues surrounding Battered Women’s Syndrome.

                 1.      Self-defense:
                 KSSB10          869-878 and 881-886           U.S. v. Peterson
                 [KSSB9          817-832]                      People v. Goetz

               [KSSB11         856-861 and 805-815]
               MPC 3.04 and 3.09

               We will be focusing on the Bernie Goetz case. One of the main issues is where to
               place the self-defense standard on the spectrum from objective (reasonable belief
               in the need to defend oneself) to subjective (subjective belief in the need to defend
               oneself); and how that relates to racial justice.

               2.      Battered Women Syndrome:

               KSSB10          903-907         State v. Norman
               [KSSB9          848-852]
               [KSSB11         837-842]
               We will also discuss how these self-defense standards apply in the context of
               women who kill their abusive partners.
