**§ 2.01 Requirement of Voluntary Act; Omission as Basis of Liability;
Possession as an Act.**

\(1\) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based
on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an
act of which he is physically capable.

\(2\) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this
Section:

\(a\) a reflex or convulsion;

\(b\) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;

\(c\) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;

\(d\) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or
determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

\(3\) Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an
omission unaccompanied by action unless:

\(a\) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the
offense; or

\(b\) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.

\(4\) Possession is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the
possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was
aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able
to terminate his possession.

**§ 2.02 General Requirements of Culpability.**

\(1\) Minimum Requirements of Culpability. Except as provided in Section
2.05, a person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted purposely,
knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with
respect to each material element of the offense.

\(2\) Kinds of Culpability Defined.

\(a\) Purposely:

A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an offense
when:

> \(i\) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result
> thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that
> nature or to cause such a result; and
>
> \(ii\) if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is
> aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes
> that they exist.

\(b\) Knowingly.

A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense
when:

> \(i\) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the
> attendant circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that
> nature or that such circumstances exist; and
>
> \(ii\) if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware
> that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a
> result.
>
> \(c\) Recklessly.
>
> A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an
> offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
> risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.
> The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the
> nature and purpose of the actor\'s conduct and the circumstances known
> to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of
> conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor\'s
> situation.
>
> \(d\) Negligently.
>
> A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an
> offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable
> risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.
> The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor\'s failure
> to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and
> the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the
> standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the
> actor\'s situation.

\(3\) Culpability Required Unless Otherwise Provided. When the
culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is
not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts
purposely, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.

\(4\) Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All Material
Elements. When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of
culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without
distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision shall
apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary
purpose plainly appears.

\(5\) Substitutes for Negligence, Recklessness and Knowledge. When the
law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an
offense, such element also is established if a person acts purposely,
knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an
element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely or
knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such
element also is established if a person acts purposely.

\(6\) Requirement of Purpose Satisfied if Purpose Is Conditional. When a
particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is
established although such purpose is conditional, unless the condition
negatives the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining
the offense.

\(7\) Requirement of Knowledge Satisfied by Knowledge of High
Probability. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an
element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is
aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually
believes that it does not exist.

\(8\) Requirement of Wilfulness Satisfied by Acting Knowingly. A
requirement that an offense be committed wilfully is satisfied if a
person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the
offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements appears.

\(9\) Culpability as to Illegality of Conduct. Neither knowledge nor
recklessness or negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense
or as to the existence, meaning or application of the law determining
the elements of an offense is an element of such offense, unless the
definition of the offense or the Code so provides.

\(10\) Culpability as Determinant of Grade of Offense. When the grade or
degree of an offense depends on whether the offense is committed
purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, its grade or degree
shall be the lowest for which the determinative kind of culpability is
established with respect to any material element of the offense.

**§ 2.03. Causal Relationship Between Conduct and Result; Divergence
Between Result Designed or Contemplated and Actual Result or Between
Probable and Actual Result.**

\(1\) Conduct is the cause of a result when:

\(a\) it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not
have occurred; and

> \(b\) the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any
> additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or by the law
> defining the offense.

\(2\) When purposely or knowingly causing a particular result is an
element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual
result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor
unless:

> \(a\) the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as
> the case may be, only in the respect that a different person or
> different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm
> designed or contemplated would have been more serious or more
> extensive than that caused; or
>
> \(b\) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as
> that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or accidental in
> its occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor\'s liability or
> on the gravity of his offense.

\(3\) When recklessly or negligently causing a particular result is an
element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual
result is not within the risk of which the actor is aware or, in the
case of negligence, of which he should be aware unless:

> \(a\) the actual result differs from the probable result only in the
> respect that a different person or different property is injured or
> affected or that the probable injury or harm would have been more
> serious or more extensive than that caused; or
>
> \(b\) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as
> the probable result and is not too remote or accidental in its
> occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor\'s liability or on
> the gravity of his offense.

\(4\) When causing a particular result is a material element of an
offense for which absolute liability is imposed by law, the element is
not established unless the actual result is a probable consequence of
the actor\'s conduct.

**§ 2.06. Liability for Conduct of Another; Complicity.**

\(1\) A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own
conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he is legally
accountable, or both.

\(2\) A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person
when:

> \(a\) acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the
> commission of the offense, he causes an innocent or irresponsible
> person to engage in such conduct; or
>
> \(b\) he is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by
> the Code or by the law defining the offense; or

\(c\) he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the
offense.

\(3\) A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of
an offense if:

\(a\) with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of
the offense, he

> \(i\) solicits such other person to commit it, or
>
> \(ii\) aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning
> or committing it, or
>
> \(iii\) having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense,
> fails to make proper effort so to do; or

\(b\) his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his
complicity.

\(4\) When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an
accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an accomplice in the
commission of that offense if he acts with the kind of culpability, if
any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission
of the offense.

\(5\) A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular
offense himself may be guilty thereof if it is committed by the conduct
of another person for which he is legally accountable, unless such
liability is inconsistent with the purpose of the provision establishing
his incapacity.

\(6\) Unless otherwise provided by the Code or by the law defining the
offense, a person is not an accomplice in an offense committed by
another person if:

\(a\) he is a victim of that offense; or

\(b\) the offense is so defined that his conduct is inevitably incident
to its commission; or

\(c\) he terminates his complicity prior to the commission of the
offense and

> \(i\) wholly deprives it of effectiveness in the commission of the
> offense; or
>
> \(ii\) gives timely warning to the law enforcement authorities or
> otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the
> offense.

\(7\) An accomplice may be convicted on proof of the commission of the
offense and of his complicity therein, though the person claimed to have
committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted or has been
convicted of a different offense or degree of offense or has an immunity
to prosecution or conviction or has been acquitted.

**§ 2.09. Duress.**

\(1\) It is an affirmative defense that the actor engaged in the conduct
charged to constitute an offense because he was coerced to do so by the
use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the
person of another, that a person of reasonable firmness in his situation
would have been unable to resist.

\(2\) The defense provided by this Section is unavailable if the actor
recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that
he would be subjected to duress. The defense is also unavailable if he
was negligent in placing himself in such a situation, whenever
negligence suffices to establish culpability for the offense charged.

\(4\) When the conduct of the actor would otherwise be justifiable under
Section 3.02, this Section does not preclude such defense.

**§ 3.02. Justification Generally: Choice of Evils.**

\(1\) Conduct that the actor believes to be necessary to avoid a harm or
evil to himself or to another is justifiable, provided that:

> \(a\) the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater
> than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense
> charged; and
>
> \(b\) neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides
> exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved;
> and
>
> \(c\) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does
> not otherwise plainly appear.

\(2\) When the actor was reckless or negligent in bringing about the
situation requiring a choice of harms or evils or in appraising the
necessity for his conduct, the justification afforded by this Section is
unavailable in a prosecution for any offense for which recklessness or
negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.

**§ 3.04. Use of Force in Self-Protection.**

(1) **Use of Force Justifiable for Protection of the Person.** Subject
to the provisions of this Section and of Section 3.09, the use of force
upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor believes
that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting
himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the
present occasion.

(2) **Limitations on Justifying Necessity for Use of Force.**

\(a\) The use of force is not justifiable under this Section:

> \(i\) to resist an arrest that the actor knows is being made by a
> peace officer, although the arrest is unlawful; or
>
> \(ii\) to resist force used by the occupier or possessor of property
> or by another person on his behalf, where the actor knows that the
> person using the force is doing so under a claim of right to protect
> the property, except that this limitation shall not apply if:
>
> \(A\) the actor is a public officer acting in the performance of his
> duties or a person lawfully assisting him therein or a person making
> or assisting in a lawful arrest; or
>
> \(B\) the actor has been unlawfully dispossessed of the property and
> is making a re-entry or recaption justified by Section 3.06; or
>
> \(C\) the actor believes that such force is necessary to protect
> himself against death or serious bodily injury.
>
> \(b\) The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this Section
> unless the actor believes that such force is necessary to protect
> himself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual
> intercourse compelled by force or threat; nor is it justifiable if:
>
> \(i\) the actor, with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily
> injury, provoked the use of force against himself in the same
> encounter; or
>
> \(ii\) the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such
> force with complete safety by retreating or by surrendering possession
> of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right thereto or by
> complying with a demand that he abstain from any action that he has no
> duty to take, except that:
>
> \(A\) the actor is not obliged to retreat from his dwelling or place
> of work, unless he was the initial aggressor or is assailed in his
> place of work by another person whose place of work the actor knows it
> to be; and
>
> \(B\) a public officer justified in using force in the performance of
> his duties or a person justified in using force in his assistance or a
> person justified in using force in making an arrest or preventing an
> escape is not obliged to desist from efforts to perform such duty,
> effect such arrest or prevent such escape because of resistance or
> threatened resistance by or on behalf of the person against whom such
> action is directed.
>
> \(c\) Except as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Subsection,
> a person employing protective force may estimate the necessity thereof
> under the circumstances as he believes them to be when the force is
> used, without retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act
> that he has no legal duty to do or abstaining from any lawful action.

(3) **Use of Confinement as Protective Force.** The justification
afforded by this Section extends to the use of confinement as protective
force only if the actor takes all reasonable measures to terminate the
confinement as soon as he knows that he safely can, unless the person
confined has been arrested on a charge of crime.

**§ 3.07. Use of Force in Law Enforcement.**

(1) **Use of Force Justifiable to Effect an Arrest.** Subject to the
provisions of this Section and of Section 3.09, the use of force upon or
toward the person of another is justifiable when the actor is making or
assisting in making an arrest and the actor believes that such force is
immediately necessary to effect a lawful arrest.

(2) **Limitations on the Use of Force.**

\(a\) The use of force is not justifiable under this Section unless:

> \(i\) the actor makes known the purpose of the arrest or believes that
> it is otherwise known by or cannot reasonably be made known to the
> person to be arrested; and
>
> \(ii\) when the arrest is made under a warrant, the warrant is valid
> or believed by the actor to be valid.

\(b\) The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this Section
unless:

> \(i\) the arrest is for a felony; and
>
> \(ii\) the person effecting the arrest is authorized to act as a peace
> officer or is assisting a person whom he believes to be authorized to
> act as a peace officer; and
>
> \(iii\) the actor believes that the force employed creates no
> substantial risk of injury to innocent persons; and
>
> \(iv\) the actor believes that:
>
> \(A\) the crime for which the arrest is made involved conduct
> including the use or threatened use of deadly force; or
>
> \(B\) there is a substantial risk that the person to be arrested will
> cause death or serious bodily injury if his apprehension is delayed.

(3) **Use of Force to Prevent Escape from Custody.** The use of force to
prevent the escape of an arrested person from custody is justifiable
when the force could justifiably have been employed to effect the arrest
under which the person is in custody, except that a guard or other
person authorized to act as a peace officer is justified in using any
force, including deadly force, that he believes to be immediately
necessary to prevent the escape of a person from a jail, prison, or
other institution for the detention of persons charged with or convicted
of a crime.

(4) **Use of Force by Private Person Assisting an Unlawful Arrest.**

> \(a\) A private person who is summoned by a peace officer to assist in
> effecting an unlawful arrest, is justified in using any force that he
> would be justified in using if the arrest were lawful, provided that
> he does not believe the arrest is unlawful.
>
> \(b\) A private person who assists another private person in effecting
> an unlawful arrest, or who, not being summoned, assists a peace
> officer in effecting an unlawful arrest, is justified in using any
> force that he would be justified in using if the arrest were lawful,
> provided that
>
> \(i\) he believes the arrest is lawful, and
>
> \(ii\) the arrest would be lawful if the facts were as he believes
> them to be.

(5) **Use of Force to Prevent Suicide or the Commission of a Crime.**

> \(a\) The use of force upon or toward the person of another is
> justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately
> necessary to prevent such other person from committing suicide,
> inflicting serious bodily injury upon himself, committing or
> consummating the commission of a crime involving or threatening bodily
> injury, damage to or loss of property or a breach of the peace, except
> that:
>
> \(i\) any limitations imposed by other provisions of this Article on
> the justifiable use of force in self-protection, for the protection of
> others, the protection of property, the effectuation of an arrest or
> the prevention of an escape from custody shall apply notwithstanding
> the criminality of the conduct against which such force is used; and
>
> \(ii\) the use of deadly force is not in any event justifiable under
> this Subsection unless:
>
> \(A\) the actor believes that there is a substantial risk that the
> person whom he seeks to prevent from committing a crime will cause
> death or serious bodily injury to another unless the commission or the
> consummation of the crime is prevented and that the use of such force
> presents no substantial risk of injury to innocent persons; or
>
> \(B\) the actor believes that the use of such force is necessary to
> suppress a riot or mutiny after the rioters or mutineers have been
> ordered to disperse and warned, in any particular manner that the law
> may require, that such force will be used if they do not obey.
>
> \(b\) The justification afforded by this Subsection extends to the use
> of confinement as preventive force only if the actor takes all
> reasonable measures to terminate the confinement as soon as he knows
> that he safely can, unless the person confined has been arrested

**§ 3.09. Mistake of Law as to Unlawfulness of Force or Legality of
Arrest; Reckless or Negligent Use of Otherwise Justifiable Force;
Reckless or Negligent Injury or Risk of Injury to Innocent Persons.**

\(1\) The justification afforded by Sections 3.04 to 3.07, inclusive, is
unavailable when:

> \(a\) the actor\'s belief in the unlawfulness of the force or conduct
> against which he employs protective force or his belief in the
> lawfulness of an arrest that he endeavors to effect by force is
> erroneous; and
>
> \(b\) his error is due to ignorance or mistake as to the provisions of
> the Code, any other provision of the criminal law or the law governing
> the legality of an arrest or search.

\(2\) When the actor believes that the use of force upon or toward the
person of another is necessary for any of the purposes for which such
belief would establish a justification under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 but
the actor is reckless or negligent in having such belief or in acquiring
or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief that is material to the
justifiability of his use of force, the justification afforded by those
Sections is unavailable in a prosecution for an offense for which
recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish
culpability.

\(3\) When the actor is justified under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 in using
force upon or toward the person of another but he recklessly or
negligently injures or creates a risk of injury to innocent persons, the
justification afforded by those Sections is unavailable in a prosecution
for such recklessness or negligence towards innocent persons.

**§ 4.01. Mental Disease or Defect Excluding Responsibility.**

\(1\) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of
such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks
substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality
\[wrongfulness\] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the
requirements of law.

\(2\) As used in this Article, the terms "mental disease or defect" do
not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or
otherwise antisocial conduct.

**§ 5.01. Criminal Attempt.**

(1) **Definition of Attempt.** A person is guilty of an attempt to
commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise
required for commission of the crime, he:

> \(a\) purposely engages in conduct that would constitute the crime if
> the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or
>
> \(b\) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime,
> does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the
> belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his
> part; or
>
> \(c\) purposely does or omits to do anything that, under the
> circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission
> constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to
> culminate in his commission of the crime.

(2) **Conduct That May Be Held Substantial Step Under Subsection
(1)(c).** Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step
under Subsection (1)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly
corroborative of the actor\'s criminal purpose. Without negativing the
sufficiency of other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative
of the actor\'s criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a
matter of law:

\(a\) lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim
of the crime;

> \(b\) enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the
> crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission;

\(c\) reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the
crime;

> \(d\) unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle or enclosure in which it
> is contemplated that the crime will be committed;
>
> \(e\) possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the
> crime, that are specially designed for such unlawful use or that can
> serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;
>
> \(f\) possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be
> employed in the commission of the crime, at or near the place
> contemplated for its commission, if such possession, collection or
> fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the actor under the
> circumstances;

\(g\) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an
element of the crime.

(3) **Conduct Designed to Aid Another in Commission of a Crime.** A
person who engages in conduct designed to aid another to commit a crime
that would establish his complicity under Section 2.06 if the crime were
committed by such other person, is guilty of an attempt to commit the
crime, although the crime is not committed or attempted by such other
person.

(4) **Renunciation of Criminal Purpose.** When the actor\'s conduct
would otherwise constitute an attempt under Subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c)
of this Section, it is an affirmative defense that he abandoned his
effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under
circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his
criminal purpose. The establishment of such defense does not, however,
affect the liability of an accomplice who did not join in such
abandonment or prevention.

Within the meaning of this Article, renunciation of criminal purpose is
not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances,
not present or apparent at the inception of the actor\'s course of
conduct, that increase the probability of detection or apprehension or
that make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose.
Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to
postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to
transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.

**§ 5.03. Criminal Conspiracy.**

(1) **Definition of Conspiracy.** A person is guilty of conspiracy with
another person or persons to commit a crime if with the purpose of
promoting or facilitating its commission he:

> \(a\) agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or
> more of them will engage in conduct that constitutes such crime or an
> attempt or solicitation to commit such crime; or
>
> \(b\) agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or
> commission of such crime or of an attempt or solicitation to commit
> such crime.

(2) **Scope of Conspiratorial Relationship.** If a person guilty of
conspiracy, as defined by Subsection (1) of this Section, knows that a
person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has conspired with
another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of
conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not he knows
their identity, to commit such crime.

(3) **Conspiracy with Multiple Criminal Objectives.** If a person
conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one
conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same
agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.

(4) **Joinder and Venue in Conspiracy Prosecutions.**

> \(a\) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Subsection,
> two or more persons charged with criminal conspiracy may be prosecuted
> jointly if:
>
> \(i\) they are charged with conspiring with one another; or
>
> \(ii\) the conspiracies alleged, whether they have the same or
> different parties, are so related that they constitute different
> aspects of a scheme of organized criminal conduct

\(b\) In any joint prosecution under paragraph (a) of this Subsection:

> \(i\) no defendant shall be charged with a conspiracy in any county
> \[parish or district\] other than one in which he entered into such
> conspiracy or in which an overt act pursuant to such conspiracy was
> done by him or by a person with whom he conspired; and
>
> \(ii\) neither the liability of any defendant nor the admissibility
> against him of evidence of acts or declarations of another shall be
> enlarged by such joinder; and
>
> \(iii\) the Court shall order a severance or take a special verdict as
> to any defendant who so requests, if it deems it necessary or
> appropriate to promote the fair determination of his guilt or
> innocence, and shall take any other proper measures to protect the
> fairness of the trial.

(5) **Overt Act.** No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a
crime, other than a felony of the first or second degree, unless an
overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have
been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired.

(6) **Renunciation of Criminal Purpose.** It is an affirmative defense
that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted the success
of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.

(7) **Duration of Conspiracy.** For purposes of Section 1.06(4):

> \(a\) conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct that terminates
> when the crime or crimes that are its object are committed or the
> agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by
> those with whom he conspired; and
>
> \(b\) such abandonment is presumed if neither the defendant nor anyone
> with whom he conspired does any overt act in pursuance of the
> conspiracy during the applicable period of limitation; and
>
> \(c\) if an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is
> terminated as to him only if and when he advises those with whom he
> conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement
> authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his
> participation in it
