# Criminal Law Outline

*This case is all about x. The prosecution will probably charge x with x for killing x, with the mens rea of x, as the prosecution will try to apply x statute to negate x defense.* 

**ASSUMING ARGUENDO (arguing in the alternative… even if initial thought was wrong, backup thought is this) that affirmative defense fails, the defense will attempt to lower the homicide charge to x – good phrase\!\!**

# Fact Pattern

## Checklist of Arguments

**KEY TIPS:**

* Check the **mens rea / actus reus** of the different degrees of charges that are available – CLEARLY EXPLAIN the different mens rea / actus reus and explain why the defendant falls under the one(s) chosen  
* Can have **multiple charges for the same person** based on the effect of their interactions with different people (killed one, recklessly endangered others)  
* **READ HIS MODIFIED STATUTES CLOSELY**  
  * If they do not have a mens rea explicitly listed, **then presumption is reckless or above – clearly state this presumption** and then see if the statute applies  
    * HE WILL TRY TO TRICK YOU\!\! Just because the actus reus is the same does NOT mean the mens rea automatically applies

**Prosecution** 

* **1\) Actus reus**   
  * Issue of causation   
    * For an act to be considered **proximate cause** of the injury, the injury must be the actual result of the act – *People v. Acosta* – PROXIMATE CAUSE TEST:  
      * 1\. Was defendant’s conduct the actual cause of the injury?  
        * Yes 🡪 move forward with examination  
        * No 🡪 no proximate causation   
      * 2\. Was the result an intended consequence of the defendant’s conduct?  
        * Yes 🡪 proximate cause  
        * No 🡪 3\. Was the defendant’s conduct a substantial factor in the harm?  
          * No 🡪 no proximate cause  
          * Yes 🡪 proximate cause UNLESS the result was highly extraordinary  
    * An individual is criminally liable if his conduct is a **sufficiently direct cause** of another’s death which should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to the individual’s acts – *People v. Arzon*  
* **2\) Mens rea**  
  * \*\*Presumption is recklessness if the statute does not specify\*\*  
  * Defendant acts with **implied malice** if the defendant’s conduct carries a high probability of death and the defendant consciously disregards this risk  
* Homicide charge spec.:  
  * **W ADDITIONAL FELONY** (or attempt or accomplice) 🡪 goes from manslaughter to murder  
  * **EXTREME EMOTIONAL DISTRESS** 🡪 goes from murder to manslaughter  
* EXPANDING LIABILITY:  
  * Attempt   
  * Complicity  
  * Conspiracy  
* Defendant not liable for injury to co-defendant when caused by person resisting the felony / murder / etc. – *State v. Canola*   
* \*When involving police officer (either force *against* officer or force *by* officer) – did others have reason to know that this individual was an officer??\*

**Defense** 

* Are the actus reus and mens rea actually met??  
* If law enforcement, was the use of force justified? MPC §3.07  
* **THROW IN ALL POSSIBLE DEFENSES**  
* **JUSTIFICATIONS**  
  * Self-Defense – MPC §3.04  
    * Duty to retreat beforehand? Nowadays, retreat tends to be the default but there are some exceptions that allow SYG:  
    * Perfect v. Imperfect Self-Defense – *State v. Norman*  
    * Battered Women Syndrome (also *State v. Norman*)  
  * Necessity / Choice of Lesser Evils – MPC §3.02  
* **EXCUSES**  
  * Necessity / Duress – MPC §2.09  
  * Insanity – MPC §4.01  
    * Incl. addiction to alcohol / drugs, in which it could also be argued that actions were not voluntary   
      * Cannot get in trouble for the status of being addicted, so must have engaged in some other act while addicted that is illegal – *Robinson v. California*   
  * **\*\*Extreme Emotional Distress\*\* (HARCOURT LOVES THIS)**  
  * Heat of Passion (typ. When men find out their wives have cheated)   
* A2 EXPANDING LIABILITY – Defense of Withdrawal / Renunciation  
  * A2 Attempt  
  * A2 Complicity  
  * A2 Conspiracy  
  * **ALWAYS try to lower the underlying offense,** even though it was not conducted by the defendant in question

**Prosecution Response**

* **A2 JUSTIFICATIONS**  
  * A2 Self-Defense  
  * A2 Necessity   
* **A2 EXCUSES**  
  * A2 Duress   
  * A2 Insanity  
    * A2 Not Voluntary due to alcohol / drugs – choice to take the alcohol / drugs to begin with *was* voluntary – *Powell v. Texas*  
  * A2 Extreme Emotional Distress

## Attempt, Complicity, and Conspiracy

|  | Attempt | Complicity | Conspiracy  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mens Rea** | What intent is required? Specific intent or Same as the underlying offense Can one recklessly commit an attempt of an intentional crime? Can one attempt a reckless or negligent crime?  | Several possibilities: Same mens rea as the principal Mens rea is to “aid” principal Knows principal’s mens rea Knows principal’s mens rea and actus reus | Agreement to conspire (with exceptions) and Complicated mens rea issues  |
| **Actus Reus** | What does D need to have done? First step Last step Substantial step Withdrawal  | How much do you have to aid/abet to be complicit? Must aid or abet; mere presence is not enough  | Overt act requirement  |
| **Punishment**  | How much do you punish? Separate crime at ½ grade below or Same punishment (MPC: considers an unsuccessful criminal just as dangerous as a successful one)  | How much do you punish? Same as principal  Accessory after the crime is subject to less punishment  | Separate offense, so two convictions (1 for doing the crime, 1 for conspiring to commit the crime) Lots of benefits for prosecution. Fixed term (5) or tied to object crime |

**Attempt (MPC §5.01)**

* **Mens Rea** of intent is TRICKY – debate over whether there needs to be specific intent to commit the crime (that ended up not coming to fruition) or intent to engage in the underlying conduct   
  * MPC outlines 3 avenues under §5.01(1) – 1\) engages in conduct (purpose), 2\) causes a particular result (with belief 🡪 knowledge), or 3\) act or omission done purposefully that is a substantial step towards the crime (purpose, as defined in §5.01(2))  
    * For all 3, need whatever type of culpability the crime specifies  
* Think about the difference between intent to cause a knowing death (intent to do a different act that you know will result in someone’s death) v. intent to directly cause a death itself v. intent to commit a different act that you did not suspect would cause death  
* **Actus Reus** differs based on jurisdiction – last act v. first step  
  * MPC outlines 3 avenues under §5.01(1), with different actus reus highlighted above  
  * §5.01(2) defines what acts constitute “substantial step”  
* **Defense of Withdrawal** – MPC §5.01(4)  
  * “It is an affirmative defense that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a **complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose**.  The establishment of such defense does not, however, affect the liability of an accomplice who did not join in such abandonment or prevention.”  
* Complicity and attempt can join to make attempted complicity, such that one is charged with attempted felony *through* complicity – MPC §5.01(3)   
* Punishment is the same as the actual crime itself

**Complicity (MPC §2.06)**

* NOT charged with the crime of aiding and abetting; rather, charged with the actual crime itself through the *act* of aiding and abetting – other person’s crime becomes your own due to the fact that you aided and abetted them  
* **Mens Rea**  
  * MPC §2.06(3)(a) really flows out of §2.06(2)(c) and defines accomplice with a mens rea of purpose – “purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense” by soliciting someone to do it, aiding someone in planning or doing it, or not stopping someone from doing it when there is a legal duty to do so  
* **Actus Reus**  
  * Conduct the same acts that would establish liability under the ultimate offense  
  * For offenses that have a particular result as an element of the offense, complicity is established if the individual acts with the same kind of culpability with respect to the result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense – §2.06(4)   
    * *Commonwealth v. Roebuck* **–** very important for unintentional homicide cases because they are result-based crimes, BUT you can take acts *intentionally* with someone else that *unintentionally* result in death  
  * *State v. Gladstone* – have to carefully distinguish which act the person was complicit in  
* **Accessory after the fact** is the one form of aiding that does **not** merge with the actual act – it is treated as a separate criminal responsibility  
* No need for the principal actor to be convicted for the accomplice to be convicted – MPC §2.06(7) 🡪 principal can be acquitted but accomplice is convicted\!  
  * Ex. principal is acquitted on insanity defense, which accomplice does not have  
* Key is to ask yourself what you have to prove based on the relationship between the defendant and the principal, and the defendant and the crime  
* **Defense of Withdrawal** – MPC §2.06(6)(c)  
  * Not an accomplice if individual 1\) terminates his complicity **AND** 2\) wholly deprives it of effectiveness OR 3\) gives timely warning to law enforcement or makes some other proper effort to prevent commission of the offense   
  * Also not an accomplice if individual is a victim of the offense – 2.06(6)(a) 

**Conspiracy (MPC §5.03)**

* Separate crime of conspiracy 🡪 crime does not *have* to have been completed (inchoate); if completed (choate), there are 2 separate convictions and offenses, one for conspiracy and the other for the offense  
* **Actus Reus**  
  * Agreement – MPC §5.03(1), *Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. US*  
  * Overt act – MPC §5.03(5)  
* **Mens Rea**  
  * Knowledge of nature of activity  
  * Intent or inferred intent – *People v. Lauria*   
    * Definitely needed for misdemeanors   
    * *May* be needed for felonies, but sometimes knowledge is enough to serve as implied intent to agree with the crime  
* 3 ways to **INFER** intent from a business – *People v. Lauria*  
  * 1\. Supplier of services has a stake in the venture  
  * 2\. There is no legitimate use for the goods or services taking place  
  * 3\. Volume of business with the buyer is grossly disproportionate to any legitimate demand / sales for the illegal use are a high proportion of the supplier’s total business  
* **MPC REJECTS THIS,** but theoretically can also be charged under conspiratorial accomplice liability, aka for crimes committed by co-conspirators *even though* those crimes were not part of the original conspiracy – *Pinkerton v. US*  
  * **BRING THIS UP** but then say MPC does not allow  
* **Defense of Renunciation** – §5.03(6)  
  * Successful affirmative defense if actor “thwarted the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose”  
* Benefits to state of conspiracy charge  
  * Admit hearsay evidence  
  * Conduct joint trial  
  * More options for location of trial  
  * Cumulative punishment  
  * Charge with conspiratorial accomplice liability / *Pinkerton* rule  
  * Statute of limitations – duration of conspiracy outlined in §5.03(7)

## Justifications

**Self-Defense (MPC §3.04)**

* §3.04(2)(b) limits use of deadly force to only situations where actor believes such force “is necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat”  
  * SUBJECTIVE not objective\! (ex. of objective is *People v. Goetz* in New York, but MPC remains subjective)  
  * NOT allowed if actor provoked the use of force against himself **in the same encounter** with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily injury  
  * NOT allowed if actor knows he can safely avoid using force by retreating or surrendering possession of a thing to a person who claims it is theirs or complying from a demand that he does not need to take anyway  
* Duty to retreat beforehand? Nowadays, retreat tends to be the default but there are some exceptions that allow stand your ground (SYG):  
  * Inside the house, when attacked by an intruder  
  * Inside the house, when attacked by a guest  
  * Much more variable: inside the house, when attacked by a co-occupant  
    * Originally many jurisdictions kept this as retreat rather than SYG, but (1) it can be hard to determine who is a close repeat guest v. co-occupant and (2) it adds greater hurdles for victims of domestic violence  
* **Perfect v. Imperfect Self-Defense** – *State v. Norman*  
  * Perfect self-defense – evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, shows that at the time of the killing the defendant reasonably believed it to be necessary to kill the decedent to save herself from IMMINENT death or great bodily harm  
  * Imperfect self-defense – some other circumstances (ex. defendant started the argument but decedent threatened to make it deadly)  
    * Not an acquittal that justifies the action but still helps reduce the sentence   
    * Must be a sentence of voluntary manslaughter or higher  
* Battered Women Syndrome (also *State v. Norman*)

**A2 Self-Defense**

* Was threat of harm actually **IMMINENT**? Very strong burden to meet – *State v. Norman*  
* REMEMBER: §3.04(2)(b) limits use of deadly force to only situations where actor believes such force “is necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat”  
  * NOT allowed if actor provoked the use of force against himself **in the same encounter** with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily injury  
  * NOT allowed if actor knows he can safely avoid using force by retreating or surrendering possession of a thing to a person who claims it is theirs or complying from a demand that he does not need to take anyway  
  * However… this is subjective not objective, so maybe odds of meeting the burden is higher than prosecution would like  
* Look to limitations on use of force under §3.09 – ex. if defendant has reckless or negligent misguided beliefs, then this does not apply

**Police Use of Force (MPC §3.07)**

* Use of force is justifiable when the officer is making or assisting in making an arrest (actus reus) and **officer believes** that such force is **immediately necessary** to effect a lawful arrest (purely SUBJECTIVE) – §3.07(1)   
* MUST… (§3.07(2(a))  
  * Make known the purpose of the arrest, or believe that it is otherwise known, or believe it cannot reasonably be made known to the person AND  
  * Have a valid warrant or believe the warrant to be valid, when applicable  
* When deadly force, MUST… (§3.07(2(b))  
  * Arrest for a felony, not misdemeanor AND  
  * Be authorized as a police officer or be assisting someone believe to be a police officer AND  
  * Believe that force used creates no substantial risk of injury to innocent people  
  * Believe that the crime for which arrest is happening involved use or threatened use of deadly force, or there is substantial risk of future use of deadly force AND  
* Whole statute is **subjective\!\!** 

**A2 Police Use of Force**

* Typically hard to respond because so much of it is subjective  
* Look to limitations on use of force under §3.09 – ex. if officer has reckless or negligent misguided beliefs, then this does not apply

**Necessity / Choice of Lesser Evils (MPC §3.02)**

* §3.02(2) does **NOT** allow necessity for an offense using **recklessness or negligence**, when that is enough to establish culpability  
* 4 stringent standards must be met: (*US v. Schoon*)  
  * (1) they were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil  
  * (2) they acted to prevent imminent harm  
  * (3) they reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be averted; and   
  * (4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the law

**A2 Necessity / Choice of Lesser Evils**

* 4 stringent standards must be met: (*US v. Schoon*)  
  * (1) they were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil  
  * (2) they acted to prevent imminent harm  
  * (3) they reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be averted; and   
  * (4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the law  
* §3.02(2) does **NOT** allow necessity for an offense using **recklessness or negligence**, when that is enough to establish culpability  
* A2 Necessity in killing an **innocent bystander** – necessity is only a justification for murder when the killing is committed in self-defense, so **cannot be used here** – *Regina v. Dudley and Stephens*  
* A2 Necessity in **civil disobedience** – necessity **does not apply here** – *US v. Schoon*

## Excuses

**Necessity / Duress (MPC §2.09)**

* “Person of **reasonable firmness in his situation** would have been unable to resist” in this conduct due to coercion by use of, or threat to use, unlawful force – §2.09(1)   
* §2.09(2) does **NOT** allow for duress for an offense using **recklessness or negligence** in placing themselves in this situation, when that is enough to establish culpability

**A2 Necessity / Duress**

* Strong standard of someone directly applying coercion to you through threat of force to yourself or another person – §2.09(1)

**Insanity (MPC §4.01)**

* Not responsible for criminal conduct as a result of a mental disease or defect through which he “lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality \[wrongfulness\] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law” – MPC §4.01(1)  
  * Altered the *M’Naughten* standard (“irresistible impulse”) by adding in the fact that there can rarely be complete impairment of ability to know or to control, so what is actually needed is deprivation of “substantial capacity” to understand his actions / conform his conduct to the law   
* §4.01(2) limits this to **NOT** include abnormality through **repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct**  
* Includes addiction to alcohol / drugs, in which it could also be argued that actions were not voluntary   
  * Cannot get in trouble for the status of being addicted, so must have engaged in some other act while addicted that is illegal – *Robinson v. California* 

**A2 Insanity**

* Strict standard of: “lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality \[wrongfulness\] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law” – MPC §4.01(1)  
* §4.01(2) limits this to **NOT** include abnormality through **repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct**  
* A2 Not Voluntary due to alcohol / drugs – choice to take the alcohol / drugs to begin with *was* voluntary – *Powell v. Texas*

**Extreme Emotional Distress (MPC §210(3)(b))**

* Defense has two principal components (*People v. Casassa*, based on §210(3)(b))   
  * 1\. The particular defendant must have "acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance," (SUBJECTIVE) and   
  * 2\. There must have been "a reasonable explanation or excuse" for such extreme emotional disturbance, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be (OBJECTIVE)  
* Does not apply if killing was a result of defendant’s malevolence, rather than a reaction deserving mercy – *People v. Casassa*

**A2 Extreme Emotional Distress**

* Tough burden to prove both components of the test are met\!\!  
  * Did defendant actually subjectively have extreme emotional disturbance?  
  * Was this behavior objectively reasonable given the situation?

## Course Themes

| How Criminal Law Entrenches Social Order |  |  |  |
| ----- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **How politics & morality are both hidden in the criminal law and through it exert an extraordinary influence on society and the social order** |  |  |  |
| Society often thinks of the criminal law as upholding moral values more so than other areas of the law. We often think of murder, rape, etc. as offending some moral sense of inherent or God-given human dignity (Kant). It’s an area of the law where law students have built-in conceptions of right and wrong, more so than when we first studied the merits of the Statute of Frauds. But that’s all wrong… The criminal law **fundamentally shapes/reinforces the racial/social order in the US**. We tend to overlook this  Even that systematic racism does not capture the foundational way in which guilt and innocence are **naturalized** in our society & the criminal law has shaped our racial, gender, and class **hierarchies** and has formed our economic and political **inequalities** To understand that, we have to look **at how criminal law has served to entrench and replicate methods of oppression**  WEB Du Bois: After Reconstruction, criminal law was used to re-establish racial hierarchy in the South. Southern states enacted criminal law codes targeted at Blacks, criminalizing behavior and ensuring harsher punishments. So recently freed blacks lost their homes and property and essentially became slave laborers. Convict leasing effectively re-enslaved blacks. **Criminal law replaced property law to re-enslave blacks in the South**.  Criminal law created a new form of servitude but not in the blatantly immoral structure of property law, but under the veil of a criminal conviction. Sprawling prisons spread in the South, with convicts forced to labor. Law enforcement, together with lynch mobs, institutionalized terror in the South. **Criminal law was the linchpin to dispossess blacks, deliberately and intentionally, restructuring society as a substitute for chattel slavery.** E.g., Alabama Constitutional Convention of 1901: disenfranchise anyone convicted of a felony or misdemeanor or crime of moral turpitude (eventually struck down by Rehnquist court) since moral turpitude was used to disenfranchise blacks “Certainly the 'crimes' and' offences' on which judgement is passed are juridical objects defined by the code, but judgement is also passed on the passions, instincts, anomalies, infirmities, maladjustments, effects of environment or heredity; acts of aggression are punished, so also, through them, is aggressivity; rape, but at the same time perversions; murders, but also drives and desires.” (Foucault, *Discipline and Punish*, 17\) **“**According to one theory, domination occurs when the ruling class gains the consent of the dominated classes through a system of ideas that reinforces the morality or inevitability of the existing order. This ‘interest theory’ sees ideology as a consciously wielded weapon, an intellectual tool that a group uses to enhance its political power by institutionalizing a particular view of reality.” (Lawrence, ‘Id, Ego” 326\) Harder today to see the fine-grained ways in which the criminal law continues to oppress. Because of the objectivity, universality of being convicted of a crime, the criminal law operates under the radar to push morality and politics into the law in a hidden way.  **So, you must be finely attuned to the way the criminal law naturalizes crime.** The category of crime can easily be made objective, universal. We tend to think of crimes in objective, universal terms – as things which have always been prohibited in human experience from time immemorial. So, we think the guilt associated with that category is a natural, objective marker of moral condemnation.  But what ends up being considered legitimate use of force (e.g., stand your ground laws) or what is considered consent to sexual intercourse (e.g., marital rape exception) or what is considered the legitimate use of law enforcement force (e.g., non-indictments of cops in Breonna Taylor shooting) show the prescription in general terms may be of time immemorial – but not their interpretation and application. We don’t see the ways criminal law is used to engage in political and social action.  **The criminal act is the most powerful device for social and moral condemnation** Punishment reflects who we are as a society**; Punishment practices need to be understood as social structures.**  The building blocks of criminal law (the elements of crimes) are very simple. But in addition to learning these, we did not understand *justice*.  |  |  |  |
| **Our culture** |  |  | Contemporary Western, European, Judeo-Christian culture.  i.e., “European, scientific, rational, and technical culture,” with its globalizing tendencies.” (Foucault) Marked by hierarchies: patriarchy, systemic racism, class order, etc. CRT: **problems of race in this country are structural, deep, foundational**, and cannot simply be fixed by individual correctives. Not just bad apples.  |
| **Power of norms** |  |  | Robinson & Darley: “Criminal law… influences the powerful social forces of normative behavior control through its central role in **the creation of shared norms**.” (CB, 121\) “Perhaps more than any other society, ours relies on the criminal law for norm-nurturing. Our greater cultural diversity means that we cannot expect a stable pre-existing consensus on the contours of condemnable conduct that is found in more homogenous societies.”  Law’s threat of punishment can induce conformity through more than just cost-benefit calculation of the rational actor “People obey the law (1) because they fear the disapproval of their social group if they violate the law, and (2) because they generally see themselves as moral beings who want to do the right thing as they perceive it.” (CB, 121\) Cognitive psychology: “the culture… transmits certain beliefs and preferences. Because these beliefs are so much a part of the culture, they are not experienced as explicit lessons. Instead, they seem part of the individual’s rational ordering of her perceptions of the world.” (Lawrence) By shaping norms, criminal law *shapes us*. It ensures members of society voluntarily uphold the social order (like Antilochus).  “Foucault demonstrates how deeply and seamlessly judgment is woven into the fabric of culture, in domains we would never have imagined: how, in realms apparently so distant from the public sphere of politics—our private bedrooms and closets—**cultural norms are woven into our daily lived experience and shape our deepest subjective reality**; how they pervade our consciousness and experience of life; how they **shape our very epistemology**—the way we see and understand the world, distinguish between science and opinion, make claims to truth; and how much work and social practice it takes to make these cultural ways of being natural and invisible throughout our lived experience.” (Harcourt, Intro to Lectures on Sexuality, 3\)  “The conclusion to be drawn from this is that **morality does not exist in people’s heads; it is inscribed in power relations** and only the modification of these power relations can bring about the modification of morality.” (*The Punitive Society*) (quoted in Harcourt, Intro to Lectures on Sexuality, 4\) “What is key is that these are all practices—social practices—and not simply things going on in our heads. . . They are the product of social practices that shape the very basis of how we draw lines and form judgments—including those of truth, those that separate science from mere opinion or ideology.” (Harcourt, Intro to Lectures on Sexuality, 9\) Crime has come to be defined as a **moral wrong**. We used to punish people for their acts. Now, we punish people for who they are.  Framing crime as a moral failure of the criminal keeps people from questioning and criticizing the penitentiary system and the larger criminal justice system.  |
| **Application to criminal law** |  |  | Just as Foucault shows how norms are woven into culture, in criminal law cultural norms are woven into our daily experiences and shape our deepest subjective reality The norms & moral values of our culture infuse the criminal law. The norms of our culture are expressed and reflected in between the lines, in the subconscious value judgments being made  E.g., What’s adequate provocation? Answer is influenced by patriarchy, monogamy, etc. The worst offenses in Blackstone (e.g., wife killing husband) reflects a culture marked by patriarchy |
| **Legitimation**  |  |  | “We conclude, with gloomy irony, that the Supreme Court’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, originally promoted by self-consciously abolitionist litigators and advanced b reformist members of the Court, not only has failed to meet its purported goal of rationalizing the imposition of the death penalty, but also **may have helped to stabilize and entrench the practice of capital punishment** in the US.” (Steiker, 360\) Court’s jurisprudence has had effect of **legitimating DP**: **Internal legitimation**:  Law is a crutch that allows people to do what they feel is unjust (*See* **Robert Cover** on abolitionist judges applying Fugitive Slave Act)  Death penalty discourse and doctrines makes the system appear more rational and fair to actors within the legal system, giving a false aura of science to the *moral* task of deciding life or death (Steiker, 431\) Sentencing judges & juries feel less ultimate responsibility for imposing death penalty, since they know that’s only the first step in a lengthy chain of review (434)  \[maybe this also applies to acquittal of Goetz, Zimmerman; no-bill of killers of Brown, Garner\] **Particular external legitimation**: Complexity of the system **makes public more comfortable with death penalty** that otherwise would be  “The public develops a strong but false sense that many levels of safeguards protect against unjust or arbitrary executions. They are thus likely to accept any executions that finally make it through the system as being more than fair enough.” (436) **General external legitimation**: CP legitimates use of physical force by state, thus legitimating state power generally.  Procedure creates an “ideology of justice” that disguises class interest of the law & encourages public to hold false or exaggerated belief in fairness of the social system (*See* **Hay** on CP in 18th c. England) (432) Reason for the Court’s approach: **House built by warring architects**: Internal dynamics, as centrists, lacking a vision of their own, have been pulled in the opposite directions of two minority absolutist wings without choosing either (437) |
| **How criminal law reflects hierarchies** |  |  | There is a through line from slavery 🡪 Jim Crow 🡪 carceral society  Slavery 🡪 convict leasing 🡪 mass incarceration  Lynching 🡪 capital punishment  **“**The criminal law and its enforcement are **primarily instruments of social ordering** predominantly deployed **to keep African-Americans and other persons of color in a condition of second-class citizenship**.” (BH, NA) Mass incarceration, policing etc. serve to segregate and weaken Black society  WEB Du Bois “demonstrated that the enforcement of the criminal law after Emancipation was used as one of the main weapons to re-enslave freed Black women and men.” (BH NA, 4\) Antebellum USA: Race of the perpetrator & victim dictated whether conduct was considered criminal Laws enabled whites to punish enslaved Blacks w/ impunity, including execution (but not vice versa) Legislatures explicitly deprived enslaved people equal protection of the common law when whites abused them: Thus, Blacks could be perpetrators, not victims All these forms of discrimination build on each other to shape society (mass incarceration of Black men 🡪 perception that Black men are dangerous 🡪 acquittal of Zimmerman, Goetz) Enabled by “reasonableness” & other standards that give jury discretion Even if you ban explicit racial language, defense lawyers can use code words, which, thanks to US culture, trigger certain perceptions & judgments (e.g., Zimmerman lawyer presenting photo of muscular Martin 🡪 Black men dangerous 🡪 Martin posed threat to Zimmerman)  |
| **Crime & punishment** |  |  | The criminal justice system is not about redressing the harms associated with crime. It’s about imposing an unjust social and racial hierarchy on US society. In other words, punishment is not a response to criminal behavior—it’s a mode of governance and control.  “We must first rid ourselves of the illusion that punishment is above all (if not exclusively) a means of reducing crime…” (Foucault, *Discipline and Punish*, 24\) Punishment as a complex social function Punishment reflects who we are as a society. Punishment practices need to be understood as social structures, reflecting social values & racial/economic hierarchies. (Foucault, *Discipline and Punish*, 24\) 18th c. to present-day, move from punishment of the body (barbaric) to punishment of the soul (punishing better). Punishment is not above all a means of reducing crime; it is a way of controlling people, throughout society, in an orthopedic fashion, making them docile. (Foucault, *Discipline and Punish*) All these forms of discrimination build on each other to shape society (mass incarceration of Black men 🡪 perception that Black men are dangerous 🡪 acquittal of Zimmerman, Goetz Punishment practices serve economic needs (i.e., need for labor) E.g., example from the Frankfurt school of a letter from the French King stating that, because of his need for oarsmen, he wished the public prosecutor of Paris to have criminal judged quickly **Harm**: the harms defined by the criminal system reflect what the dominant groups in society believe to be good for society. Perceptions of harms reflect existing hierarchies.  Goal: prevent have-nots from taking from the haves Racial & class dynamics shape perceptions of harms (that’s why street crime is prosecuted more aggressively than white collar crime) “The very notion of harm at the heart of criminal law enforcement—the very measure of “an even-handed way”—is inflected by the normative structure of the existing social and racial order.” (BH, NA, 22\) E.g., theft is bad because we live in capitalist society & it takes wealth from those who have it (even if distribution is inequitable)  |
| **Reform?** |  |  | Reform the criminal justice system? Or abolish it? Reforms are a distraction from abolition  “This progressive position rests on unstable foundations. The reason is that the existing social and racial order shapes the very conceptions of harms and violence that lie at the heart of the enforcement of criminal law. In other words, the perception of harm and violence associated with criminality is determined by race, gender, class, and other relations of power in society. It is not possible to talk about the harms caused by crime in a vacuum. The “harms caused by crime” are artifacts of the present social condition and racial hierarchies.” (BH, NA, 20\) “We would need to look beyond restorative justice—or reimagine it—because it remains today too wedded to the existing understandings of harm shaped by our current society traversed by systemic racism and sexism.” (BH, NA, 36\) “Pragmatic thinkers will resist this invitation as overly utopian. Rather than imagine a just social order, the pragmatist will respond that we should extract racism—even systemic racism—from the practices and institutions, and enforce the criminal law on a race-neutral basis.” BUT “American society, without racial hierarchy, would be an entirely different society.” (BH, NA 23\) Abolition would result in: Better schools, more healthcare, justice system based on reconciliation, not retribution |
| **Examples of punishment as a reflection of society & its hierarchies** |  |  |  |
| **Felony murder rule** | Footnote to ***Serné*** quotes Edward Coke, Institutes 56 (1644): If a man accidentally shoots another while hunting & trespassing on another’s land, that’s felony-murder. If a man accidentally shoots another while hunting on *his own land*, that’s just an accidental killing. Shows class/property dimension: What rends the same act punishable is the fact that you’re not the property owner.  Felony murder in part comes from class; woven into the law in ways we rarely see  Felony murder operates as a way to **entrench social order**, including systemic racism, into the law  Maybe that’s why society was ready to take Adnan Khan, a homeless drop-out, and put him in prison for the rest of his life \[incapacitation\] |  |  |
| **Homicide** | Laws of homicide as form of social ordering (i.e., reflecting & reinforcing social hierarchy) Laws of homicide do more than define homicide. They also include an enormous amount of normative judgment Napoleonic Code (1810): one of the “worst” forms of homicide is patricide **Petit treason:** Certain crimes were considered the most serious homicide, including servant killing master, wife killing husband, or ecclesiastical person killing superior. **Blackstone**  Punishment: for a man, to be drawn & hanged; for a woman, to be drawn & burned. Napoleonic Penal Code (1810): Patricide is among the “worst” types of homicide—why is that? What does this say about society? What assumptions are baked in there? |  |  |
| **Provocation** | As noted in ***Girouard***, one of the traditional categories of provocation which can allow murder to be mitigated to manslaughter is the sudden discovery of adultery. This reinforces patriarchy (it’s almost always a husband killing his wife, not vice versa) & privileges the dominance of the husband over the wife.  “From his own statements and from his own testimony, it is clear that, terribly provoked by his allegedly nagging, belligerent and sadistic wife, defendant remembered the gun, deliberately took it down, and deliberately fired two shots into the head of his sleeping wife. There is no doubt that this was a willful, deliberate and premeditated murder.” (***Carroll***) Reflection of patriarchal culture. |  |  |
| **Manslaughter** | ***State v. Williams*** (Wa. Ct. App. 1971): Native American couple fails to take sick child to doctor for fear that government will wrongly assume negligence and take the child away. The child dies and the couple is convicted of manslaughter on ordinary negligence standard.  For context, in the time of the case “child welfare agencies often were quick to assume that ‘the best interests of the child’ were served by removing Native American children to other homes.” (CB, 502\) In 1978, Congress passed the Indian child Welfare Act, aiming to “reverse that dynamic by giving tribal governments primary authority over child custody proceedings involving Native American children.” (502) The court notes the race of the defendants. Seems like their race was (a) the reason the child died in the first place and (b) possibly the court found them guilty of manslaughter   Example of criminal law reflecting the normative judgments of society, including systemic racism & the social hierarchy |  |  |
| **Sentencing guidelines** | Risk scores determine different levels of punishment in some jurisdictions (e.g., VA rape sentencing) Maps on to socioeconomic, racial categories (e.g., more points for unemployment or for lack of education past 9th grade) |  |  |
| **Punishment**  | Vitiello:  “In **Puritan** America, the law was used to advance the dominant religious beliefs and to enforce "proper standards of moral behavior." Based on the Calvinist belief in the innate depravity of human beings, the criminal law served to keep people from temptation.” (CB, 122-123) “**Quaker** views contrasted sharply with the Puritan conception of the criminal law. Early in our history, the Quakers led a movement away from capital and corporal punishment to a system of workhouses and prisons. Viewed as grim in retrospect, that system was generally enlightened by comparison to earlier treatment of criminals. At root, it was based on an **optimism about human capacity for transformation**. Like proponents of the medical model, Quakers believed that crime was the product of society, rather than a result of inherent sinfulness. But the method chosen for transformation was not "treatment." Instead, they believed that the offender could be **reformed through a process of rationality**. Freed from the corrupting influences and permitted to reflect on moral questions, the offender could be "restored to fellowship with God and humanity.’” |  |  |
| **Self-defense: *Goetz***  | The legal standard **legitimates** Goetz’s racially motivated killing because it allows the jury to act on the racially biased views they’ve imbued from society (e.g., racially biased crime stats). In their eyes, the youths had attempted to rob Goetz (despite no conclusive evidence of that) and his violence was justified as vigilantism. Of course, if the races were flipped, the outcome would have been different. Although official standards (e.g., “reasonableness”) are meant to exclude racial bias, they fail to do so in practice.  |  |  |
| **SYG laws** | Likely to be a white person shooting dead a Black person |  |  |
| **Criminal Law as Instrument of Social Control** |  |  |  |
| **Rape law** | When rape was a capital crime, it was usually only imposed on black men accused of raping white women  “Black men may still be at exceptionally high risk of unjust conviction and disproportionate punishment, while black women—even more than other rape victims—may have exceptional difficulty getting effective protection from police, prosecutors, and juries.” (358) Marital rape  |  |  |
| **Mass incarceration** | Way of subjugating Black & other minority communities There is a through line from slavery 🡪 Jim Crow 🡪 carceral society  Chattel slavery 🡪 convict leasing & planation prisons 🡪 mass incarceration  Lynching 🡪 capital punishment  **“**The criminal law and its enforcement are **primarily instruments of social ordering** predominantly deployed **to keep African-Americans and other persons of color in a condition of second-class citizenship**.” (BH, NA) Mass incarceration, policing etc. serve to segregate and weaken Black society |  |  |
| **Capital punishment** | Way to reinforce subordinate role of Blacks in racial hierarchy (e.g., Walter McMillan, prosecuted for murder as a substitute for miscegenation)  |  |  |
| **More** | See Steiker on theories of **legitimation**  See Bright on **access to counsel** (how much justice can you afford?) |  |  |
| **Critical Legal Studies** |  |  |  |
| Broader CLS argument: law is not a scientific inference from rules & precedent. Law is a rhetorical discipline whose structure can be mapped. (e.g., Balkin: courts will use arguments to realize particular vision of society). |  |  |  |
| Language: Often Empty Terms We Fill |  |  |  |
| Malice |  | “The definition of murder is unlawful homicide with malice aforethought. And the words malice aforethought are technical. You must not, therefore, construe them or suppose that they can be construed by **ordinary rules of language**. The words have to be construed according to a long series of decided cases, which have given them meanings different from those which might be supposed.” (***Serné***) The term “malice” in common law is a **container that doesn’t mean anything itself, but that we fill with whatever precedential law we make.** It’s the same thing for any legal term (e.g., negligence, recklessness, purpose). Every legal term we use lacks an ordinary language meaning, doesn’t come with a correct concept. It’s a technical vehicle to create law. What we do when we’re interpreting and arguing cases is effectively trying to fill the container, the technical term, with whatever moral, political, social forces that we think are going to be to the advantage of our client.  Thus, there is no relationship between language and the object described.  |  |
| Proximate cause |  | ’Proximate cause’ … is, in a sense, artificial, serving matters of **policy** surrounding tort and criminal law and based partly on **expediency** and partly on concerns of **fairness** and justice.” ***Acosta*** |  |

## Theories of Punishment

![Diagram, venn diagramDescription automatically generated][image1]

**Key Factors to Consider**

1. General Justifying Aim:  Why do we set up social institutions that impose punishment?  
2. Distribution:  Why do we impose punishment on a particular individual?  
3. Degree:  What justifies the amount of punishment imposed in a given case?

**2 Broad Categories of Punishment: RETRIBUTION and UTILITARIANISM**

**Retribution** (moral theories about blame)  
\*\*Backward-looking\*\*

* **SUPPORTERS**  
  * People who comply with societal rules should benefit, not assume the burdens of those who do not comply, or else there would be no inherent reason to comply  
  * **Kant** limits punishment to address the moral wrong someone has committed – modified version of an eye for an eye in that only people deserving of punishment are held responsible  
  * **Moore** confirms that retributivists should only punish when offenders deserve it  
    * Duty to urge punishment on all offenders, even if the victims themselves do not want punishment, because offenders acted wrongly  
    * Idea of *lex talionis* – punishment should represent the severity of the act  
    * Must meet pareto efficiency in that no person is worse off / sacrificed in an attempt to punish others  
  * **Morris** emphasizes social contract – those who punish break the social contract, so it is reasonable and just to punish them  
    * Crime gives individuals an unfair advantage, because they still have the benefits of the system but renounce the burden of self-restraint  
    * Punishment brings individuals back to par with law-abiding society  
  * Positive retribution 🡪 a just society *must* impose punishment equal in severity to the seriousness of the crime  
  * Negative retribution 🡪 seriousness of the offense sets an upper limit to permissible punishment but does not mandate that the state punish to that extent  
* **REJECTORS**  
  * **Murphy** holds that, if we are morally sensitive enough to assert the moral right to punish, then we must ensure that criminals are genuinely acting autonomously and intentionally, and are benefitting from their crimes… in other words, the way society is structured now, that is not necessarily the case  
  * **Hampton** points out the problem that criminals are not necessarily gaining a benefit from their crime   
  * **Mackie** holds that the suffering or deprivation suffered by one criminal does not pay anything to society or push back against other existing crimes

**Utilitarian** (theories to maximize social welfare)  
\*\*Forward-looking\*\* \- based on consequences of punishment

* **SUPPORTERS**  
  * **Bentham** advocates for minimizing pain and maximizing pleasure   
    * All forms of punishment are pain, there is nothing beneficial to doing so (as opposed to Kant’s belief), so it should only be imposed as much as necessary to affect people’s behavior  
    * Very rational view of people’s behavior  
    * Moral notion of blameworthiness is not relevant to utilitarianism  
  * Some utilitarianists like Bentham oppose the death penalty (even though it deters, it has a bruising effect on society) while other utilitarianists like Becker and Posner support the death penalty because of its deterrent effects  
  * Act utilitarianism 🡪 specific action becomes morally right when it produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people  
  * Rule utilitarianism 🡪 type of action is morally right depending on the correctness of the rule that allows it to exist  
* **REJECTORS**  
  * **Kant** says you cannot treat people as means, but rather as an end in themselves, otherwise you could punish someone for a crime they did not commit just because doing so has deterrent effects  
  * Often criticized for paying insufficient attention to individual rights and the perceived need for connection between punishment and offender’s actual blame

**Other Theories within Utilitarianism…**

**Deterrence**   
\*\*Point of criminal punishment is to deter offenses by threatening to inflict painful consequences on those who commit them\*\*

* **SUPPORTERS**  
  * Key supporter is **Bentham** under his utilitarian framework  
  * 2 methods of deterring crime:  
    * 1\. Increase the risk of conviction  
    * 2\. Increase the severity of the punishment  
  * Marginal deterrence 🡪 when two offenses are in conjunction, the greater offense ought to be subject to more severe punishment, such that the criminal has a motive to commit the lesser crime  
    * Key assumption is that individuals are elastic and make rational decisions taking this into account  
  * **Becker** argues that anyone would commit a crime for the right price, so the key is to make the harm high enough (either increase risk of getting caught through better detection mechanisms or increase sentencing at trial) such that the optimal number of crimes occurs  
    * NOTE: detection is likely a better solution given an additional year in prison is not that bad when a sentence already exists, whereas getting caught when you thought you could get away without punishment is bad  
  * **Robinson and Darley** find a new route of deterrence – moral influence\!  
    * People obey the law less so because of the threat of punishment and more so because they fear disapproval of their social group  
    * Criminal law helps set the norms of what is viewed as morally right v. wrong, which then impacts how social groups interpret actions  
    * Unclear if this has been met yet… criminal law needs to develop a reputation for justly punishing only those who deserve and protecting those who do not deserve it.. but we likely are not at that point yet  
* **REJECTORS**  
  * **Wilson** argues that people are not rational and often the consequences of crime are not clear (due to delay, uncertainty, and ignorance of criminals) so simple deterrence does not work  
  * **Robinson and Darley** list off requirements that would make deterrence theory successful, but because they are not met indicate that deterrence fails  
    * 1\) potential offender must know of the rule  
    * 2\) he must perceive the cost of violation as greater than the perceived benefit, and   
    * 3\) he must be able and willing to bring such knowledge to bear on his conduct decision at the time of offense  
  * People are not necessarily elastic / rational\! Whole theory assumes they are

**Incapacitation**  
\*\*Prison and jail are designed and operated to restrict those under their control\*\*

* **SUPPORTERS**  
  * Selective incapacitation targets offenders most likely to commit serious crimes at high rates based on statistics   
  * **Zimring** holds that the main objective of the basic structure of the modern prison and jail system is incapacitation   
  * **Wilson** argues that people have different relations with time (present v. future-oriented), so rational economic logic does not work – advocates instead for incapacitation, either selectively based on who has already committed crimes or predictively based on who is most likely to commit a crime  
  * **Dilulio** says that prisons are very cost-effective ways to restrain known, convicted individuals from committing more crimes – costs society at least 2X as much to let a prisoner loose than lock them up  
* **REJECTORS**  
  * **Cohen** argues selective incapacitation can be problematic because it relies on probabilities (who is likely to commit a crime, if a person has committed a crime once are they more likely to do it again) when in reality punishment should be DESERVED based on the crime that is committed  
    * Predictive approaches can be highly inaccurate and raise a number of ethical concerns surrounding crimes that have not yet been committed  
      * Esp. discrimination based on race\!  
      * Does not take into account people reforming their ways  
    * People who have committed the same offense deserve equal punishment

**Rehabilitation**  
\*\*Justifies punishment for either or both societal purposes and individual benefit purposes once the criminal is reformed\*\*

* **SUPPORTERS**  
  * Much of 20th century was marked by support for rehabilitation  
  * **Moore** finds that two ideals of rehabilitation: not only (1) make criminals safe enough to return to the streets but also (2) equipped to lead successful lives  
  * **Vitello** holds that certain offenders are amenable to rehabilitation, and they can be identified based on objective criteria   
* **REJECTORS**  
  * Very paternalistic viewpoint\! Recasts punishment as “treatment” for the “good of the criminals” which is often not the case  
  * **Martinson** originally argued that rehabilitative efforts that have been reported thus far (time of writing \= 1974\) have no appreciable effect on recidivism – LATER RESCINDED this conclusion but the study popularized regardless

**Other Theories Broadly…**

* **Nietzsche** argues that we no longer care about the purposes of punishment… we have certain actions we want to take and then find ways to impose meaning upon the practice  
* **Rusche and Kirchheimer** find that punishment serves to further the goals of political economy and the monarchy (/ those in power in the present day)  
* **Von Hirsch** holds that an offender’s amenability to particular treatment is dependent on their social and personal characteristics, rather than uniform across the board  
* **Foucault (*Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison*)** shows how forms of punishment have changed over time, starting with public executions (ex. execution of Damiens) and corporal punishment in 1757 to panopticons and regulated, isolated, privatized administration of punishment in the mid-19th century  
  * 3 parts of the argument: genealogy, panopticism, and productivity  
  * Punishment has changed even though discourse around punishment have not  
  * Reversal of the spectacle into surveillance in that punishment used to be about public execution with one offender and many spectators, but in the modern panoptican system has turned into many prisoners with one spectator guard… also used to be all about harming the body but now is about suspending rights  
  * Mass incarceration started skyrocketing in 1973  
  * Discipline, regimentation, spatialization, etc. have been used to train the public for military combat and in the education system… now it is used in prisons  
    * Minute regulation was done for purposes of industrialization – do not need just capital but also physical bodies  
    * Foucault argues the creation of penitence and panopticon serves the exact same purpose of internalizing discipline  
      * Internalization is key\! We administer these things to ourselves now… we have been trained to control ourselves  
      * No longer about reducing crime but about regulating bodies  
    * Image of orthopedics: humans are crooked beings, and punishment serves to transform our social order and discipline us to be straight  
* In **early forms of conflict**, the emphasis was on whom God protected… battles, drownings, etc. served as both trials and punishments, where those who survived were deemed innocent and those who succumbed deemed guilty  
  * Just as now, back then these actions were taken to try to give meaning to punishment

**Justifications in Practice**

* Prior criminal history is factored into sentencing guidelines, but rather than indicate level of dangerousness, this indicates likelihood of being policed again  
  * Risk score used by judges when determining sentencing is incredibly biased  
* Not really about deterrence at all\! Judges have no way of determining whether the defendant is rational and how a given sentence will affect him or her

**Justifications Under MPC**

* MPC §1.02(2) provides general purposes for punishment  
* New version of MPC includes the idea of blameworthiness – not just about deterrence but also about retribution  
  * Has a little bit of every possible theory of punishment… want to give judges a rationale for whatever theory of justice they choose to pursue, but in doing so is completely contradictory

**“Post-Modern Meditations on Punishment: On the Limits of Reason and the Virtues of Randomization”** – Harcourt 

* Questions of punishment have changed over time, but the point is that the answers are irrelevant – questions themselves never really mattered\! Empirical facts run out, or the deductions of principle reach their limit, or both… whatever “leaps of faith” (gaps and ambiguities) were active choices made about which hypotheses or principles to purport  
  * Enlightenment: If theologians can no longer ground political and legal right, then on what foundation does the sovereign’s right to punish rest? On what basis does the state have a right to punish its citizens?   
    * Flaw: The right to punish is what defines sovereignty, so it cannot serve to constrain sovereign power – it would be fruitless to seek the origin of the right to punish by analyzing the purpose or utilities of punishment  
  * Late 19th C: If the rational discourse over the right to punish is mere pretext and serves only to hide power formations, then what is it exactly that punishment practices do for us? What is the true function of punishment? What is it we do when we punish?   
    * Goal: “Power/knowledge” critique – focused on the constructed nature of knowledge  
    * Shifted toward 3rd inquiry via critiques of metanarratives, functionalism, and scientific objectivity  
  * Contemporary: What do our punishment practices tell us about our cultural values? What is the social meaning of our institutions of punishment?   
    * Goal: To make sense of the world and us, and reflect our societal values to better understand punishment and evaluate our practices / institutions  
    * Flaw: Still cannot escape the power/knowledge critique – texts still tell us more about the interpreter’s beliefs, intuitions and ethical choices than they do about the practices of punishment and their social meaning.  
* **\*\*KEY TAKEAWAY\*\*** \- punishment is NOT rational\! It is culturally determined – modern thinkers try to justify practices like deterrence, racial profiling, and broken windows policing as “rational” or “efficient,” but they are merely based on predictive tools that are inherently biased  
* **PROPOSED SOLUTION** – turn to randomization\!   
  * Only way to completely abandon misguided attitudes of modernity   
  * **Empirical studies are all based on certain assumptions – critique of all data-driven articles we have\!\!**  
  * Government allocates resources to law enforcement priorities by chance and courts that receive these resources determine punishment by randomization  
    * Key restriction: still rely on proportionality of crime to harm, and within that range rely on randomization  
  * Randomization is the only way to act within the bounds of critical reason and remind us that our knowledge claims are limited so our supposed ideological bases are irrelevant  
  * Offers more transparency in policymaking

**“Illusion of Order: The False Promise of Broken Windows Policing”** – Harcourt 

* One of the primary means of supporting broken windows policing comes from a 1990 study conducted by Wesley Skogan – Harcourt replicated this study and found an error in the original study that made the original holding invalid

**“The Morality of the Criminal Law”** – H.L.A. Hart

* Does not make sense to punish two people who committed the same act two different ways just because of the outcome (one actually was able to complete the crime, the other was not) – essentially making punishment decisions based on good luck v. bad luck

**VS.** 

**“A History of the Criminal Law”** – James Fitzjames Stephen

* If one person injures others while another does not, it does not make sense to hold them accountable for the same crime just because their negligent acts were the same… both deserve punishment, but to lesser extent  
* Otherwise, there is less deterrence, because people know they will be held accountable regardless

## Slave Cases and Punishment Today

EVERYTHING we do as lawyers relates to the racial and economic social order of society – easier to see after-the-fact with slave cases but is true for every single thing we have studied thus far

Legal history is also crucially important, ex. *McQuirter v. State*, as it shows the history of relations of power that we still uphold today

**“Imagery and Adjudication in the Criminal Law and Antebellum Slave Cases”** – Harcourt 

* Image that is painted of the defendant is incredibly important\!\!  
  * Sometimes portrayed as a vulnerable individual who did not know any better / had no other choice, but other times portrayed as a threatening, savage, or even diabolical person  
  * **KEY IDEA:** Ideologies and images affect one another\! Ideologies shape and sharpen images, but images also sharpen and transform ideologies  
  * When parties have completely different images on who the defendant is, they end up engaging in the adjudication process talking about two completely different individuals  
* Looks specifically at 3 historical periods with consistent imagery:  
  * Antebellum South projected slave criminals as shifting from a harmless and obedient servant to the threatening and rebellious slave  
    * Slaveholder had discretion to determine outcome  
  * Warren Court consistently reflected he defendant as a vulnerable young person who was poor and uneducated, unfortunately impacted by the acts of an overbearing police officer  
    * Scale typically tipped in favor of defendant  
  * Rehnquist Court consistently projects defendants as deeply threatening, cold-blooded, and recidivist   
    * Scale typically tipped in favor of victim  
    * Recurring images of the slave\!\! Key example is ***McQuirter v. State***, which traces its genealogy directly to slave law based on the cases it cites (*McQuirter* cites *Kelley v. State* which cites *Lewis, a slave v. The State*) … shows that the imagery from the southern antebellum is still relevant in the 1950s and arguably today\!

**“Wrong-Doing, Truth-Telling”** – Foucault 

* Chariot race amongst 5 Greek legends – crux is the race between Menelaus and Antilochus – challenges entire social order of Greece  
  * Antilochus, the younger (and therefore less strong) hero, beats Menelaus, the senior hero, because he did not heed for Menelaus when instructed to  
  * Rather than go before a jury, they are told to take oaths and tell Zeus that Antilochus is stronger than Menelaus… which Antilochus cannot do, so he concedes to Menelaus and apologizes for his youthful cockiness  
* Calling on jury would have forcefully imposed the social order upon Antilochus, whereas his act refusing to swear indicates he internalized the social order himself… r**econstitutes the social order in a more powerful way because he shows the rest of society that the order is right**  
* Same thing happened in slave cases\! **System was maintained through legal rules – requiring defense counsel for enslaved persons, refusing certain types of testimony, etc. seem like protections, but really serve to make the system seem equitable to hide how it enforces the social order**  
  * Ex. Alabama passed a law allowing slave owners to gain 100% of the value of their enslave dis executed, but governor vetoed it to maintain 50% reimbursement, as this was the only way to maintain “humanity”  
    * Shows how weak the system was\! Limit of 50% was needed 

***The State v. Clarissa***

* Original indictment was defective because it did not require jurors to rule on whether Jamestown weed is actually poisonous – this is a crucial aspect of the prosecution’s argument\!   
* Clarissa’s mother, Chloe, was tortured into giving a confession, and Clarissa similarly was tortured into confessing – everyone agrees that this is not admissible because it was under duress – but Clarissa made a subsequent confession implicitly in her answer to her enslaver, and the question is whether that second confession is admissible  
* Court holds that this second confession cannot be admitted because it presumes guilt based on a prior confession made under duress… unclear how this would have played out if the first confession was not under threat  
* *“The humane policy of our law, would exclude such evidence coming from a white person, and the reason is much stronger for excluding it in the' case of a slave.”* 

***Wyatt v. The State***

* Court is attentive to the dominating relationship between enslaved and enslaver, such that confessions by enslaved are not voluntary  
  * Cites to *Clarissa*  
* Improper motivations of confession: 1\) avoiding harm and/or 2\) gaining benefit / protection  
* Even though the confession in question was in front of the magistrate judge, Wyatt was brought there right after being tortured and made his statement while his enslaver was still in the room, so duress still holds  
* Judge did not take any acts to destabilize the power relations (ex. force enslaver to leave, promise Wyatt he would not be tortured if he did not confess, etc.)

## Interpreting / Arguing Facts

**“Legal Thought” – Chirlesteine** 

* Legal thought and argument have a crystalline structure – every question can be broken down into dyads (or triads, etc.) with multiple levels to get from the beginning to the end of a case  
* Crystalline in two ways: 1\) self-replicating nature and 2\) order and transparency  
* Doctrine 🡪 series of *rule choices* – each choice is a dyad  
* Certain refinements to improve the theory:  
  * There is no one necessary or correct alternative to a given rule of law to form a dyadic rule choice (when you choose to make a dyad instead of a triad, etc.) though there are rules that clearly cannot serve as alternatives  
  * Even when a rule is seen as the result of a choice between many alternatives, it can be treated as a series of dyadic rule choices  
  * A discrete body of legal doctrine can be viewed as a series of dyadic rule choices of ever-increasing specificity  

**“Interpretive Constitution in the Substantive Criminal Law”** – Mark Kelman

* Unconscious interpretive constructs shape how we view disruptive incidents, though they are never explicitly identified or discussed by judges in opinions  
* Choice of interpretive construction often allows the judge or other legal analyst to avoid dealing with broader political problems  
* 2 time-based unconscious constructs  
* 1\. Narrow v. broad time frames  
  * Whether an action is determined / involuntary or intentional / freely willed often depends on the time frame through which the case is analyzed… looking at one specific incident provides a different view than looking at their history of behavior or relationships with affected individuals  
  * Ex. drug addict convicted of possession of illegal substance  
    * From a narrow view, the person has a disease and cannot control their need for the substance, so should not be charged with a crime  
    * From a broad view, the person made initial decisions to consume illegal substances that led to them being addicted, so providing legal flexibility now fails to deter individuals from taking drugs in the first place  
  * Ex. *Martin* v. *Decina*  
    * Court in *Martin* took a narrow view and found that the defendant did not enter the public highway voluntarily so should not be charged, even though he like voluntarily undertook actions that got him arrested in the first place   
    * Court in *Decina* took a broad view and found that defendant should have known the dangers of driving with epilepsy and chosen not to engage, even though he could not control when a seizure would take place  
  * Ex. abandonment defense  
    * Abandonment defense looks at a broad view to argue that the defendant’s subsequent failure to consummate harm makes them innocent  
    * However, this same rationale does not apply to defendants who follow through with crimes but are remorseful after, without a clear reason why one is allowed but the other is not… once one performs an act indicating intention to commit a crime, there is no rational reason to not treat the performance of these acts as proof of criminal intent  
  * Ex. provocation v. history of torture – courts are often more sympathetic to immediate provocation resulting in a crime as compared to years-long torture resulting in a crime  
* 2\. Disjoined v. unified accounts  
  * Moments that took place before the crime was committed can influence the interpretation of the crime, depending on whether the acts are viewed separately or as one cohesive incident  
  * Ex. theft is a necessary component of our property system, yet every theft must be justified as a separate account rather than understood together

## Juries / Interpreting Reasonable Behavior

**“The Fiction of the ‘Reasonable Man’”** – R. Restak

* Neurologist and neuropsychiatrist who is convinced that there are no reasonable people under conditions in which death or severe bodily harm are believed imminent  
* Limbic system gets aroused in threatening situations and can become a directive force for hours, sometimes days… it is very hard to shut off  
* Standard of reasonableness in criminal law is therefore impractical in certain situations

***People v. Goetz***  
Definition of reasonableness is “whether the defendant’s conduct was that of a reasonable man *in the defendant’s situation*” – which is objective… but this is not in the MPC (and Goetz eventually is acquitted of attacking four unarmed black teens, even under the objective definition of reasonableness\!)  
MPC takes a subjective approach, stating that culpability arising from a mistaken belief in need to use force should be no greater than culpability that would arise if made with respect to an element of a crime 🡪 need to only show subjective belief that use of deadly force was necessary to protect oneself

**“Goetz Case: Commentary on Nature of Urban Life”** – Joseph Berger

* Jury eventually rejected the charge of attempted murder on Goetz – this seems to provide commentary on the state of urban life nowadays  
* Individuals are so charged with nervousness engaging in mundane activities in urban areas that the perception of threat can attain the power of facts  
  * Aka the fact that there was no actual threat does not matter because Goetz perceived a threat

**“Race Ipsa Loquitur: Of Reasonable Racists, Intelligent Bayesians, and Involuntary Negrophobes”** – Joy D. Armour

* Law does not define “reasonable beliefs” as “typical beliefs”  
  * In other words, even if the “typical” American believe that blacks have a higher propensity to violence, the law does not have to accept that as a reasonable justification for self-defense against a black person  
  * Reasonability extends beyond typicality to consider the social interests in a given situation… an actor’s failure to overcome racism is therefore blameworthy and thus an unreasonable justification for violence  
* Crime often underreports other race’s involvement (thereby overreporting black crime), and to the extent that is not true, higher black crime is often linked to socioeconomic status rather than race  
* Potential corrective measure – race-based evidence of reasonableness should be excluded under state evidentiary code, finding them “more prejudicial than probative”

## Importance of Counsel

***Gideon v. Wainwright*** **(1963)**  
Supreme Court ruling held that the right to a lawyer is “fundamental and essential” to fairness in the criminal courts, and lawyers must be provided to indigent persons so that every person “stands equal before the law”

**“Fifty Years of Defiance and Resistance after *Gideon v. Wainwright*”** – Bright and Sanneh

* Right to counsel as outlined in *Gideon* has still not been recognized 50+ years later  
* Standard of “effective counsel” rather than “competent counsel” results in poor representation\!\!  
* Criminal system is not truly adversarial because prosecutors have broad, unchecked power that essentially helps determine results in criminal cases with little or no input from the defense  
  * Act as both inquisitor and adversary  
  * Judges often adopt prosecutors’ statement of facts as the true account, without considering inconsistencies brought up by the defense  
* Governments have failed to adequately fund defense systems, and many judges tolerate or even welcome inadequate representation  
* Leaves criminal system with little legitimacy, which affects us all

**“Counsel for the Poor: The Death Sentence Not for the Worst Crime but for the Worst Lawyer”** – Stephen Bright 

* Representation for the poor in capital cases is woefully inadequate  
* Many people are put to death because they are too poor to afford a lawyer, not because their cases merit it  
* Adversary system does not function due to… lack of funding for the defense of indigent people, lack of indigent defense programs, lack of compensation for attorneys  
* Appointment and oversight of mediocrity and incompetence with regard to the judges, who also tolerate a minimal standard of legal representation

**“Black on Black Representation”** – Alexis Hoag

* Expansion of the 6th Amendment right to counsel of choice to indigent defendants would be of particular benefit to black defendants, as they could choose black counsel who maintain racial congruency and cultural competency  
  * Empowering indigent black defendants to choose black counsel could help mitigate anti-black racism in the criminal justice system  
  * Education and clinical therapy both recognize the benefits or racial congruency, and similar arguments can be applied here  
  * Interviews indicate better communication and trust between black defendants and black counsel  
* Next steps include recruiting more black public defenders and training more culturally competent lawyers

**“The State of the Death Penalty”** – Ankur Desai and Brandon L. Garrett

* Decline in death penalty cases in recent years – states reached modern lows in 2016 and 2017 (the time when this article was written)  
* State-level legislative changes that may have reduced the likelihood of death sentences…  
  * Decline in homicides and homicide rates  
  * Increase in life without parole (LWOP) statutes  
    * Actually, based on data, this did NOT contribute to lower capital punishment  
  * *Ring v. Arizona* requires the final decision in capital sentencing to be made by a jury, not a judge  
  * Improvements in state-wide public defender offices allows for better representation at capital trials  
    * Based on data, this was the BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR to lower capital punishment  
    * Has implications beyond the death penalty context\!\! Underscores the importance of 6th Amendment right to counsel

## Capital Punishment

**Factors Influencing Death Penalty**

* Race of defendants and victims, as indicated by *McCleskey v. Kemp*  
  * Race of defendant alone is not a driving factor under the Baldus study – it is the interaction of the race of defendant and race of victim that is predictive  
* Local demographics  
  * Black-on-black homicides typically occur in neighborhoods with higher population of black individuals, so prosecutors might not seek death penalty as frequently because the community is less supportive of capital punishment as a whole (blacks are the one demographic group that largely opposed death penalty)  
  * Calls into question whether prosecutorial discretion ought to reflect the preferences of the population being served  
* Make-up of the jury  
  * More white jurors in a white victim case can increase likelihood of death penalty, while black jurors strongly prefer life sentences  
  * “Death qualifying” juries 🡪 in capital cases, potential jurors that oppose the death penalty in all circumstances can be struck, so juries tend to be male, white, and politically conservative  
* Electoral politics, since being tough on crime garners votes for judges  
  * Court has started to crack down on this, holding a Florida law that allowed judges to make the final call on death penalty (considering jury recommendations but not at all obligated to them) unconstitutional under the 6th Amendment  
  * Delaware also concluded that its state capital sentencing regime violates the 6th Amendment, and Alabama is likely next since it has the same model  
* Weirdly enough, prosecutors in Georgia in counties with the fewest murder cases sought the death penalty about twice as often as prosecutors in counties with the highest murder cases, which goes against what deterrence would suggest

**Constitutionality of Death Penalty**

* Must satisfy two constitutional requirements: 1\) procedural due process 14th Am. and 2\) cruel and unusual punishment 8th Am.  
* Due process  
  * Court rejected that due process required explicit criteria of decision between life and death – ***McGautha v. California*** – states are entitled to assume that jurors will act with due regard for the consequences of their decision, so no further standards must be met  
* Cruel and unusual punishment  
  * Capital punishment must have a meaningful basis for distinguishing the cases in which death penalty is posed and when it is not, so that it is not inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner – ***Furman v. Georgia*** – **as administered at the time** of *Furman* (1972), SC held that death penalty **violated due process**  
  * Very contentious 5-4 decision with each justice writing their own opinion and very few signing on to other opinions  
    * Justices Brennan and Marshall concluded that all capital punishment was unconstitutional, Douglas stressed the potential for discriminatory administration of death penalty, White found the infrequency with which death penalty was invoked rendered it incapable of promoting its proclaimed social and public purposes, and Stewart emphasized not only infrequency but also randomness of how the penalty is imposed   
    * Justices Burger, Blackumn, Powell, and Rehnquist dissented based on the long tradition and continued acceptance of capital punishment, and the role of the courts v. the legislature  
  * Lots of confusion for states\! They had to address the concerns raised in *Furman* by either enacting legislation to make death penalty mandatory in certain cases (thereby reducing randomness) or establishing guidelines to determine who would be subject to capital punishment  
  * All of this discussion made the **impact of *McGautha* minimal**, as the same conversation led to more nuanced results, just under a different constitutional principle  
  * Later clarified in ***Gregg v. Georgia*** (below), which held death penalty abides by 8th Amendment under certain circumstances

***Gregg v. Georgia*** \[Supreme Court\]

* Death penalty for crime of murder is not a violation of the 8th and 14th amendments… **BUT does not allow for all capital punishment**, as sometimes assumed, but **only allows because certain requirements are met**  
* Stewart majority:  
* Analysis of “excessive” punishment has two requirements – 1\) cannot involve unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain and 2\) cannot be grossly out of proportion with the severity of the crime  
  * Presume the validity of a punishment selected by a democratically elected legislature, so as long as it is not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate, it stands  
* History and precedent of punishment in America support that this does not violate the 8th Amendment  
  * For nearly two centuries, this court has held that death penalty is not invalid, and a large proportion of American society relies on it  
  * **Changes** in the four years **since *Furman*** are **such that** **the “standards of decency” argument no longer applies**  
    * Bifurcated procedure in which the question of sentencing is not considered until after the determination of guilt has been made could eliminate some of the constitutional deficiencies in *Furman*   
    * Jury could also be given better guidance regarding the factors about the crime that both parties believe are important for sentencing  
    * This is a different baseline concept than *Furman*\! There, it was about randomly imposing the death penalty, but here, it is about having the option of the death penalty but at each stage of the trial deciding whether to impose the death penalty or give leniency with a lower sentence  
* Death penalty comports with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the amendment  
* Serves two principles: 1\) retribution / expression of societal moral outrage and 2\) deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders  
  * Retribution is a core part of the nature of man… people will turn to self-help and anarchy if they do not get the justice they want from the court system  
  * Deterrence statistics are inconclusive but could point in the right direction  
* Punishment of death is not disproportionate in relation to the crime of murder  
* Marshall dissent:  
* Constitutionality of death penalty depends on an *informed* citizenry, and steps have still not been taken to educate juries adequately about the impact of their sentences  
* Deterrence argument is flawed – capital punishment is not necessary to deter crime  
* Retribution argument is flawed  
  * Death penalty is not necessary to stop people from taking matters into their own hands  
  * Relying on retribution is an inadequate utilitarian argument looking at the societal benefits as a whole  
  * Results in a total denial of the wrongdoer’s dignity and worth

***Atkins v. Virginia*** \[Supreme Court\]

* Death penalty is deemed excessive under the 8th Amendment when applied to a mentally disabled offender  
* Stevens analysis:  
* Popular legislative support against sentencing disabled individuals   
  * From 1986 – 2002 (time of the case), 18 states with the death penalty passed legislation barring sentencing individuals with mental disabilities  
  * When congressional legislation in 1988 reinstated the federal death penalty, it too expressly forbade a sentencing of death upon a person who is mentally disabled  
* Sentencing mentally disabled individuals also **fails to meet the core justifications** for the death penalty, **namely** **retribution and deterrence as per *Gregg***  
  * Retribution is based on culpability, and mentally disabled individuals inherently have lesser culpability, so they do not merit the most extreme form of retribution  
  * Deterrence is meant to dissuade future behavior, but due to less likelihood that mentally disabled individuals can engage in logical reasoning and control impulses, there is little deterrence benefit here  
* Further complications include possibility of false confessions and lesser ability to make persuasive showing of mitigations due to inability to provide meaningful assistance to counsel and typically poor performance on the witness stand  
* Without an independent reason to disagree with popular opinion and legislative acts, the court defers to these decisions and bans death penalty for mentally disabled people  
* Scalia dissent:  
* No support in the text or history of the 8th Amendment itself – barely any discussion happens about the actual amendment in the majority opinion  
* Falsifies public opinion  
  * 18 states is only 47% of the 38 states that permit capital punishment, so this is not “popular” support like the majority claims  
    * Prior cases have typically required higher levels of popularity for a change to be made  
  * Even if execution of mentally disabled people is uncommon notwithstanding the fact that they just make up a tiny fraction of society, like the majority says, that is proof that mental retardation is a constitutionally mandated mitigating factor at sentencing, so there is no need for additional regulation  
  * Views of professional and religious organizations, and public opinion polls, are irrelevant for this court  
* Both retribution and deterrence arguments are flawed – just because they do not work as effectively on mentally disabled people as with the general population does not mean they have no effect, and therefore they should still be instituted   
* This decision could be made by the legislature, but is not adequately suited for the court

**“Sober Second Thoughts: Reflections on Two Decades of Constitutional Regulation of Capital Punishment”** – Steiker and Steiker

* Death penalty rulings are simultaneously over and under regulated, as the complexity that the Court has instituted in such rulings focus on relatively few aspects of death penalty practices, while other important aspects remain unregulated  
* Different rationales for why this may be the case…  
  * Court’s institutional incompetence   
  * Inability to “doctrinalize” capital sentencings  
  * Court just never took the time to take systematic account of its death penalty jurisprudence and the wholistic effect that it has  
    * Alternative view in similar idea: justices are so attached to their own projects that they are unwilling to engage in larger-scale reformation  
  * Existence of inconsistent blueprints drafted by justices with diametrically opposed views to each other  
    * Brennan and Marshall formed the abolitionist wing (getting rid of death penalty) in *Furman*, which Blackmun eventually joined 20 years after dissenting in *Furman*  
    * Burger and Rehnquist advocated for abolishing court regulation of death penalty through the 8th Amendment… new heirs of this view are Scalia and Thomas  
    * Center included Stevens and Powell, now O’Connor  
      * Center never had its own clear vision of what the nature and scope of 8th Amendment regulation should be, it just tries to find some sort of balance between the two opposing poles, so we are now stuck with a compromise that pleases nobody  
  * Justices only want to use regulation as a façade, and can do so here – **legitimation theory \*\*KEY TAKEAWAY\*\***  
    * Internal legitimation 🡪 extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way actors within the legal system itself perceive the system and their role in it  
      * Highly plausible that this is the case for two reasons:  
      * 1\) creates false sense of rationality and fairness of the system, which makes individuals more comfortable with the use of capital punishment than they would be absent such law  
        * Almost worse than the 1960s when judges gave juries full discretion, because then they had a moral obligation but now they use the **crutch of law**  
      * 2\) dilutes the sense of responsibility for imposing the death penalty because there are a whole range of judicial checks  
        * HOWEVER, these checks are almost all procedural\! Courts do not go back to look at the morality of the decision, but rather whether procedurally there were any flaws… so the checks do not play the role that the public thinks they do   
    * Particular external legitimation 🡪 extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way people in general view a specific practice  
      * To a slightly lesser extent, both the rationality and sense of responsibility arguments apply here  
      * Although members of the public not involved in juries / other aspects of sentencing likely do not know much about the court’s death penalty doctrine, they *think* they know a great deal, and this is part of what they know  
      * Elaborateness of death penalty jurisprudence fuels the public’s impression that ay death sentences that are imposed and upheld are part of a very rigorous system of constraints  
    * General external legitimation 🡪 extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way people in general view social structure writ large  
    * NOTE: eventually reject the façade idea spec… not plausible that the court meant to deceive because there is no way the justices have reached a single intent, and this is an overly functionalist account  
* Different approaches the court could take instead…  
  * Focus on outcome-based regulation rather than process-based regulation  
  * Adopt a special “super due process” for death cases  
* Conclude with the idea that the key question is not so much *why* the court’s doctrine has persisted despite failures, but rather *what* external effect it has besides its failure as regulation

## Poverty (and Capital Punishment) 

**“Counsel for the Poor: The Death Sentence Not for the Worst Crime but for the Worst Lawyer”** – Stephen Bright 

* Representation for the poor in capital cases is woefully inadequate  
* Many people are put to death because they are too poor to afford a lawyer, not because their cases merit it  
* Adversary system does not function due to… lack of funding for the defense of indigent people, lack of indigent defense programs, lack of compensation for attorneys  
* Appointment and oversight of mediocrity and incompetence with regard to the judges, who also tolerate a minimal standard of legal representation

**“The State of the Death Penalty”** – Ankur Desai and Brandon L. Garrett

* Decline in death penalty cases in recent years – states reached modern lows in 2016 and 2017 (the time when this article was written)  
* State-level legislative changes that may have reduced the likelihood of death sentences…  
  * Decline in homicides and homicide rates  
  * Increase in life without parole (LWOP) statutes  
    * Actually, based on data, this did NOT contribute to lower capital punishment  
  * *Ring v. Arizona* requires the final decision in capital sentencing to be made by a jury, not a judge  
  * Improvements in state-wide public defender offices allows for better representation at capital trials  
    * Based on data, this was the BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR to lower capital punishment  
    * Has implications beyond the death penalty context\!\! Underscores the importance of 6th Amendment right to counsel

## Race (and Capital Punishment)

**“Valuing Black Lives: A Case for Ending the Death Penalty”** – Alexis Hoag

* Large amount of discretion built into capital punishment sentencing has resulted in the undervaluing of black murder victims’ lives… people indicted for killing black individuals receive less harsh sentences on average  
* Need to challenge this on equal protection grounds… legislators were aware of slave codes in criminal law (treating blacks differently from whites) and intended to resolve this, among other issues, by passing the 14th Amendment  
* Best strategy is likely…  
  * Bringing the challenge when a black defendant is convicted for murder of a white victim, to show proof of a similar case with a black victim with less severe consequences  
  * Showing proof of PURPOSEFUL discrimination, including records of *Batson* violations, personnel files, and any public statements they have made  
  * Advocating for the remedy of getting rid of capital punishment as a whole, given the only alternative is to start sending more people to death row

**“Black on Black Representation”** – Alexis Hoag

* Expansion of the 6th Amendment right to counsel of choice to indigent defendants would be of particular benefit to black defendants, as they could choose black counsel who maintain racial congruency and cultural competency  
  * Empowering indigent black defendants to choose black counsel could help mitigate anti-black racism in the criminal justice system  
  * Education and clinical therapy both recognize the benefits or racial congruency, and similar arguments can be applied here  
  * Interviews indicate better communication and trust between black defendants and black counsel  
* Next steps include recruiting more black public defenders and training more culturally competent lawyers

***McCleskey v. Kemp***

* Sentenced to death for the murder of a white police officer who was responding to a silent alarm that went off during a robbery   
* Cites the **Baldus Study**, showing a disparity in the imposition of the death sentence in Georgia based on the race of the murder victim and, within that, the race of the defendant  
  * Defendants charged with killing white people receive the death penalty in 11% of cases while those killing black victims only received the death penalty in 1% of cases  
  * Death penalty was assessed in 22% of the cases involving black defendants and white victims, 8% of cases involving white defendants and white victims, 3% of the cases involving white defendants and black victims, and 1% of cases involving black defendants and black victims  
* Found that McCleskey’s sentencing did not violate 8th and 14th Amendments, despite existence of Baldus study  
* 14th Am. equal protection clause   
  * Requires proof that decision-makers in McCleskey’s case specifically engaged in discriminatory manner, which there is no proof of here  
  * Also suggests that the state as a whole acted discriminatorily by adopting the capital punishment statute despite evidence of its biased use in practice, but again there is no proof  
    * He would have to show that legislature adopted this BECAUSE of the discriminatory effect, not just in spite of  
    * As established in *Gregg v. Georgia*, it is possible for the Georgia capital sentencing system to operate in a fair and neutral manner, so underlying assumption cannot be bias  
* 8th Am. cruel and unusual punishment  
  * There is always some risk of racial prejudice affecting the jury – the question is when that risk is so great that it becomes constitutionally unacceptable  
  * Safeguards are in place to check the jury  
  * In light of the fundamental value of jury trial in the criminal justice system and the benefits on an individual discretionary sentencing decision, the court cannot overrule jury power based on the Baldus study  
* Concerned that the logical conclusion of the study / McCleskey’s argument would throw into question the basic principles underlying the criminal justice system  
* Arguments such as these are better suited for the legislature, not the courts  
* Brennan dissent:  
  * Do not need proof of discrimination in McCleskey’s case – court has always emphasized RISK of discrimination, not actual discrimination, in cases involving imposition of arbitrary sentences (ex. *Caldwell v. Mississippi*)  
    * McCleskey has more evidence than most cases, given he is not speculating on how a system might operate but provides direct proof on how it does operate  
  * State must prove *beyond a reasonable doubt* that it did not impose the sentencing irrationally, which here it cannot do  
  * Cannot use *Gregg* as evidence of the Georgia system working – the case did not permanently approve the system but rather said safeguards were assumed sufficient absent evidence to the contrary, and now McCleskey is providing evidence to the contrary\!  
  * This is the court’s role, not the legislature’s, because the voices of people affected by this system are often too faint against a majority that prefers punishment, and the court’s whole role is to give space to non-majoritarian voices  
* Blackmun dissent:  
  * Once the defendant establishes a prima facie case, as happened here, it is the burden of the prosecution to rebut it – *Batson v. Kentucky* – state must prove that the challenged effect was due to “permissible racially neutral selection criteria”  
* Stevens dissent:  
  * If the options are a racially discriminatory death sentence or no death sentence, the Constitution prefers the latter over the former  
  * There are ways to impose a just death sentence – Baldus study highlights serious crimes for which prosecutors consistently seek and juries consistently impose the death penalty, with race not affecting outcomes, so the court could just limit the death penalty to these cases and thereby get rid of any influence of race on capital punishment outcomes

**Updates Post-*McCleskey***

* Legislative initiatives have passed to address non-neutral enforcement  
  * Kentucky Racial Justice Act (KRJA) was the first state to allow capital defendants to challenge their prosecutions using statistical evidence of racial discrimination  
  * North Carolina Racial Justice Act goes a step further by allowing evidence that race was factored into jury selection to be considered as well  
* MPC withdrew the death penalty provision (§210.6) in 2009 due to institutional and structural obstacles in maintaining an adequate system… has not officially endorsed or opposed used of death penalty, but this action speaks volumes

**“Critical Version of *McCleskey v. Kemp*”** – Mario Barnes

* Rejects a narrow interpretation of the intent doctrine and instead turns to unconscious applications of race discrimination, as supported by ample evidence that discrimination operates outside the realm of conscious racial intentionality   
* Advocates for totality of circumstances as evidenced by 4 standards:  
  * 1\. Interdisciplinary analysis of the alleged discrimination, including relevant documented legal and social history and research, to evaluate whether racism is operating beyond the narrow parameters of conscious intentionality  
  * 2\. Whether the evidence offered by the parties to conduct such interdisciplinary analysis comports with the Federal Rules of Evidence  
  * 3\. Empirical evidence of the outcomes of the application of an allegedly discriminatory practice or law, such as statistical analyses  
  * 4\. Consideration of the gravity of the law being applied, in this case a life and death matter  
* Based on these standards, *McCleskey v. Kemp* should have been decided in favor of McCleskey

## Race (In Other Areas)

***McQuirter v. State***

* 1953, Alabama  
* In determining intent, jury may consider social conditions and customs founded upon racial differences, i.e. that Allen was a white woman and McQuirter was a black man  
* Found that, because McQuirter followed Allen for a while, he had an attempt to commit an assault with the intent to rape

**“The Id, the Ego, and Equal Protection: Reckoning with Unconscious Racism”** – Charles R. Lawrence III

* As established by *Washington v. Davis*, plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of a facially neutral law have to prove racially discriminatory INTENT from those responsible for enacting or administering the law… 2 objections:   
  * 1\. Puts an incredibly difficult and often impossible burden of persuasion on plaintiffs\! This is the wrong side to put the burden on  
    * Requiring proof of intent essentially legitimizes the continued existence of racially and economically discriminatory conditions  
  * 2\. Injury exists regardless of the decision-maker’s motives – the real problem is the fact of racial equality, not the motive behind the action  
* This rule has been supported because proponents argue an alternative would cost too much, limit legitimate legislative decision-making, make innocent people pay the costs for remedying a harm in which they played no part, go against the values of equal protection by forcing the judicial decisionmaker to explicitly consider race, and cause a trade-off with other legitimate social interests  
* **KEY ARGUMENT:** court incorrectly classifies actions as either intentional and unconstitutional or unintentional and constitutional – decisions can be influenced by some combination of the two  
  * Two explanations for unconscious nature of racially discriminatory beliefs:  
    * Human mind defends itself against the discomfort of guilt by refusing to acknowledge beliefs that cause such guilt  
    * Because racism is so deeply ingrained in our culture, it is likely to be transmitted by tacit understandings that have never been explicitly articulated, so are less likely to be experienced at a conscious level  
* **NEW TEST:** look at cultural symbols that have racial meaning to determine whether governmental conduct conveys a symbolic message to which the culture attaches racial significance  
  * Helps determine the beliefs and motivations of the government actors as well, since they reflect cultural beliefs more broadly surrounding these symbols / racial considerations  
  * Seeks to understand individual responsibility in light of modern insights into human personality and collective behavior  
  * Does not affect non-race-dependent decisions that heavily impact racial minorities for other reasons (ex. they are over or under-represented in the decision’s targets) but does target race-dependent decisions  
  * More likely to accept this test because it does not directly place fault / blame upon individuals\! It still recognizes that a harm has occurred but does so based on a collective failure to address racial biases  
* Two normative principles that justify judicial intervention when unconscious racial motivation has been identified:  
  * 1\. Right to due process  
  * 2\. Anti-discrimination principle, which should be broadened to include unconscious racism that intrudes upon moral values and principles  
* Recognizes that this test will not be easily accepted – thus far, the interests of minorities in achieving racial equality has only been accommodated when they converge with the interests of powerful whites

**“Race Ipsa Loquitur: Of Reasonable Racists, Intelligent Bayesians, and Involuntary Negrophobes” – Joy D. Armour**

* Law does not define “reasonable beliefs” as “typical beliefs”  
  * In other words, even if the “typical” American believe that blacks have a higher propensity to violence, the law does not have to accept that as a reasonable justification for self-defense against a black person  
  * Reasonability extends beyond typicality to consider the social interests in a given situation… an actor’s failure to overcome racism is therefore blameworthy and thus an unreasonable justification for violence  
* Crime often underreports other race’s involvement (thereby overreporting black crime), and to the extent that is not true, higher black crime is often linked to socioeconomic status rather than race  
* Potential corrective measure – race-based evidence of reasonableness should be excluded under state evidentiary code, finding them “more prejudicial than probative”

**“A Spectacle of Slavery Unwilling to Die: Curbing Reliance of Racial Stereotyping in Self-Defense Cases” – Jonathan Markovitz**

* Many ways to rely on racial stereotypes without using race language\!\!   
* Ex. use of specific language like “vultures” and “predators”  
* Ex. reenactment using people of the same race, so that there need not be an explicit discussion of race, but the message is received  
* Ex. emphasis on brute physicality when describing people of color

## Evaluating Efficacy of Laws

**Factors to Consider…**

* Proportionality to the situation  
* Requisite mens rea – often assumption is recklessness, but law might need to apply to even negligence  
* Impact on attempted act versus actual act (sometimes, including attempt is valid, ex. police use of force; other times, including attempt is too much)  
* Whether it treats misdemeanors and felonies the same  
* How it defines crucial words, ex. “force,” “necessity”  
* Whether it includes objective / reasonable standard (it should\!\!) and, if it does, whether that standard is well-defined  
  * Lots of readings on whether reasonable person is possible

**Jordan Neely Murder**

* Young black homeless man with mental illness (depression after his mom was murdered by her boyfriend) who started making noise on the subway  
  * 56% of those who are heads of households in shelters are black people – Coalition for the Homeless  
* Penny, his murderer, is a 24-year-old who served in the Marines as a sergeant   
* No charges have been filed yet, as detectives interviewed but then released Penny… likely would be incredibly different if discussing a black homeless man who had choked to death a white Marine\!  
* Similarities to cases we have studied…   
  * Chokehold used by NYC officer Daniel Pantaleo used to kill Eric Garner in 2014  
    * Here, death was not caused by an officer  
  * Kneeling over neck of George Floyd in 2020, for which Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 years of prison  
    * However, this was in Minnesota, not New York  
  * ***People v. Goetz*** – Goetz shot and gravely injured four black youths on a NYC subway train after two of them approached him and asked for $5, with an illegal handgun he had been carrying for three years  
    * Also testified that he would have shot the teenagers further if he had been under more self-control  
    * Still, jury found that he acted reasonably based on the specific situation under NY Penal Law §35, and he was eventually acquitted  
      * NOTE: in our case, he was indicted, but then the casebook said he was later acquitted

## Comparison of State Laws

**Self-Defense**

* MPC §3.04 only says “believes,” which is a subjective standard, while New York’s inclusion of “reasonably” indicates intent to make this an objective standard

**Duty to Retreat (Pre-Self-Defense)**

* Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder under Florida law  
  * Mens rea \= “depraved mind” – death must be caused by an unlawful act “imminently dangerous to another and demonstrating a depraved mind”   
  * Law is very confusing\! Definition of “depraved mind” gives mens rea of intent, knowing, AND reckless, YET then finds there need not be intent to cause death… might be because focus is on the act instead of the result (of death), but still odd\!  
* Justifiable use of force under FL law 776.012 says such use is justified without duty to retreat when a person reasonably believes such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm or to prevent a forcible felony (specifically aggravated assault, battery, or stalking)  
* NOTE: no defense if aggressor is the one who provokes / uses force first UNLESS the threat is imminent, or he has exhausted all other available means – 776.041  
  * “Threat is imminent” is inherently satisfied  
  * “Exhausted all other available means” is essentially a lesser duty to retreat  
* Person cannot be arrested, detained, or charged unless there is probable cause that the force that was used was unlawful – 776.032 – creates a big hurdle against SYG\! This is why it took so long for Zimmerman to be charged

**Law Enforcement Use of Deadly Force**

* Both statutory constraints – NYPL §125, NYPL §35.30.1, and MPC §3.07 – as well as constitutional constraints – 4th Amendment (unreasonable seizure of one’s body) – must be abided by  
  * In *TN v. Garner*, Supreme Court held that under the 4th Amendment an officer may only use deadly force if there is a good-faith belief that the suspect poses significant threat of death or serious physical harm  
* Comparing NYPL §35.30.1 and MPC §3.07  
  * MPC requires officers to make known the purpose of the arrest unless it cannot reasonably be made known, whereas NYPL does not require this… contentious facts about informing Vassel to drop his weapon would have been a bigger issue under MPC  
  * MPC is subjective – “believes” – though §3.09 then qualifies this to make it reasonable (not “reckless or negligent”), while NYPL is objective from the start – “reasonably believes”

**Necessity / Choice of Lesser Evils**

* Illinois necessity law looks more like choice of lesser evils based on objective belief (“reasonably believes”) – *People v. Unger*   
* MPC necessity law is also lesser of two evils, with some subjective (defendant “believes”) and some objective (evil avoided “is greater than” evil conducted here) components  
* NYPL actually looks like realistic necessity based on objectivity (“conduct is necessary”), with the additional requirement that the injury to be avoided is not the fault of the defendant

**Necessity / Duress**

* Duress defense did not exist in NJ at the time – the court looked to common law to establish a duress standard – *State v. Toscano*  
* Both NJPL and MPC §2.09 use the standard of objective (“person of reasonable firmness”) and subjective beliefs  
* MPC defense does not hold if actor was reckless or negligent in putting themselves in the situation that caused duress… in other words, defendant is held to the standard of intentionally committing a crime if defendant acted recklessly or negligently

**Attempt**

* Mens rea of intent is TRICKY – debate over whether there needs to be specific intent to commit the crime (that ended up not coming to fruition) or intent to engage in the underlying conduct   
  * NYPL §110.00 requires both an intent (purpose) to commit the crime and conduct that tends to effect commission of the crime  
  * MPC outlines 3 avenues under §5.01 – 1\) engages in conduct (purpose), 2\) causes a particular result (knowledge), or 3\) act or omission done purposefully that is a substantial step towards the crime  
    * For all 3, need whatever type of culpability the crime specifies  
  * Cal. Penal Code §664 is very vague, as it just says “attempt,” so depends on how courts interpret  
  * Ill. Comp. Stat. specifies intent and conduct  
* Actus reus differs based on jurisdiction – last act, first step, withdrawal issues

**Complicity**

* MPC §2.06(3) really flows out of §2.06(2)(c) and defines accomplice with a mens rea of purpose – *State v. Gladstone*  
  * On one hand, Gladstone could not meet the mens rea of purpose for Kent’s sale because he did not have any stake in the sale going through, and similarly did not particularly care whether or not Thompson bought marijuana  
  * On the other hand, he literally drew Thompson a map of how to get to Kent to purchase drugs, which gives evidence of purpose for both accounts, particularly for purchase  
* NYPL §20.00, New York’s version of accomplice liability has 1\) mens rea of the crime with the 2\) specific intention / purpose to aid in the completion of the act   
* Illinois Law is also very similar  
* California Law, CALJIC No. 3.00, is tougher, because the mens rea is 1\) knowledge of the principal actor’s purpose and 2\) purpose to aid the principal actor  
  * As long as Gladstone knew that Thompson meant to engage in an illegal purchase of marijuana, which he clearly did, then he can be found for the crime  
  * Oddly, it is easier to argue that Gladstone had the purpose of helping Kent sell marijuana (aka MPC rule) than it is to argue that Gladstone had knowledge that Kent *would* sell the marijuana (aka California rule)  
* In California, as long as the result is FORESEEABLE, the result is attributed to you – *People v. Luparello*  
* MPC is more specific, rejects simply natural and probable consequences, and instead tries to specify what you could be held accountable for  
* MPC 2.06(4) is very similar to PA statute because it deals with accomplice when the crime is defined at least in part by the result… indicates that an accomplice in the conduct is guilty of the result if he acts with the kind of culpability needed for that result – *Commonwealth v. Roebuck*

## Just Mercy Quotes

“Each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done. My work with the poor and the incarcerated has persuaded me that the opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice.” – Bryan Stevenson

“It’s been so strange, Bryan. More people have asked me what they can do to help me in the last fourteen hours of my life than ever asked me in the years when I was coming up.” He looked at me, and his face twisted in confusion.” – Herbert, as he was being led to execution

Uncried Tears, a poem by Ian Manuel, who in 1990, at the age of 13, was convicted to die in prison:

Imagine teardrops left uncried  
from pain trapped inside \-  
waiting to escape  
through the windows of your eyes.

"Why won't you let us out?"  
the tears question the conscience,  
"Relinquish your fears and doubts  
and be healed in the process."

The conscience told the tears,  
"I know you really want me to cry,  
but if I release you from bondage,  
in gaining freedom you will die."

The tears gave it some thought  
before giving the conscience an answer \-  
"If crying brings you to triumph  
then dying's not such a disaster.”
