I.  **Introduction**

    A.  **Why We Live in Sick World**

        a)  1% of Adult pop is behind bars

            (i) Mostly male

        b)  1/3 black men ages 16-24 are behind bars

        c)  Number incarcerated increasing exponentially since 1973

            (i) Coupled with increased disproportionality of people of
                color in prisons

        d)  Used to have many more people in mental hospitals

            (i) Those populations were mostly white and had a solid % of
                females

    B.  **Law & Social Order**

        a)  Focualt: Chariot Race in Iliad is an early judicial scene

            (i) Menelaus should have come in second. He is stronger. He
                is the more seasoned hero

            (ii) Antilochus should have deferred to Menelaus at the
                 post, but he didn't and came in second. This subverts
                 the whole point of the race, to demonstrate the truth
                 of the social order we already knew.

            (iii) M asks A to swear to Zeus that A was right not to
                  defer and the post. A refuses. He knows it's a bad
                  idea to challenge Greece's accepted social order in
                  front of Zeus. A assumes responsibility for his
                  misdeed and thus reconstitutes the social order on his
                  own. No trial needed, making for a stronger testament.

            (iv) The person who is right, is supposed to win. M needed
                 to have beaten A

        b)  [State v. Clarissa]{.underline} (AL 1848): Court also says
            the confession obtained from salve after a common beating is
            inadmissible, as is a confession elicited from a slave in
            response to a question which assumed guilt and was
            accompanied by a veiled threat of a beating.

        c)  [Wyatt v. State]{.underline} (AL 1854): Court refused to
            admit confession of arson coerced by a master. Even refuses
            to admit a second confesson made by the slave in front of a
            judge who made no threat

        d)  Antebellum AL criminal slave law:

            (i) Owner of slave found guilty of capital crime was
                entitled to compestion of ½ the slaves value, paid from
                state treasury

            (ii) Governor had vetoed a bill that would have raised the
                 compensation level to 100%

            (iii) Owner had to pay for an attorney for a slave charged
                  with capital offense

            (iv) AL seems to have reduce the incentive for owners to
                 accuse their slaves through the judicial process. Abuse
                 of this system would lead to a breakdown of the social
                 order. Decisions like [Clarissa]{.underline} and
                 [Wyatt]{.underline}, similarly, were necessary to keep
                 the system going. Too much violence against slaves
                 could lead to the downfall of AL's social order.

            (v) Cases also emphasized the relations of power between
                master and slave.

        e)  Robert Cover: Argues that judicial interpretation has
            practical and violent impact

            (i) Legal interpretation as a practice is incomplete without
                violence

            (ii) It depends on the social practice of violence to
                 operate

            (iii) Can always draw connections to Cover piece🡪bring
                  interpretation into real world. You can change an
                  interpretation, but how much impact will it actually
                  have

            (iv) Judge Stern of the US court of Berlin understood this
                 when he refused to sentence he hijackers convicted in
                 his court. Considering the situation, Stern saw that he
                 would have no power over the prisoners once they were
                 sentenced and refused to subject them the whims of the
                 US army

II. **Why Punish?**

    A.  **Retribution**

        a)  Essentially "Backward-looking"

        b)  Kant: Punish because and only because the person deserves it
            (moral blameworthiness)

            (i) Crimes are moral wrongs because they violate categorical
                imperatives (the penal law)

            (ii) Kant has both a negative and positive retribution
                 theory

            (iii) Punishment is necessary to correct or balance out a
                  wrong in society

            (iv) Even is society disbanded, every last convicted
                 murderer should be killed

            (v) Utilitarian theories are unacceptable unless they have a
                retributivist limit (see pg 94.2)

        c)  Moore: All retributivism requires is that there be desert
            (that punishment is justified by the moral culpability of
            those who receive it.)

        d)  Morris: Retribution is about maintaining an equilibrium of
            benefits and burdens on society

            (i) Based on a theory of a social contract of consent

            (ii) Those who break the law violate the social contract, so
                 it is reasonable and just to punish them.

        e)  Though retribution implies lex talionis few would argue for
            this outside of homicide

        f)  There is also an element of restitution/vengeance to the
            victim in some retributivist arguments

    B.  **Utilitarianism**

        a)  Essentially "forward-looking"

        b)  Bentham: Punishment should be employed if it serves a
            purpose to the world

            (i) Only punish if it will cause a benefit, to "exclude some
                greater evil"

            (ii) Not necessarily tied to what the person "deserves"

            (iii) The benefit of the punishment must be weighed against
                  its cost to society

        c)  Becker: Economic analysis applies to crime and punishment

            (i) Assume rational actors will always commit crimes at the
                right price, so some policing and punishment is required

            (ii) Must minimize the cost of both crime and
                 policing/punishment

            (iii) To eliminate crime completely would be too costly

            (iv) There is some optimal level of both crimes and
                 policing/punishment

        d)  Deterrence: Punish to deter people from committing crimes in
            the future (metrics are not reliable)

            (i) Punishment must exceed the benefit of committing a crime

            (ii) Concept of marginal deterrence: don't over punish a
                 crime because then people wont care about doing a
                 severe crime over a lesser crime

            (iii) Deterrence relates to both the probability of
                  detection and to the sentence

                  (1) Expected benefit \< probability of being
                      punished\*expected punishment/length of sentence

            (iv) General deterrence: D's punishment is meant to deter
                 the general community

            (v) Specific deterrence: D's punishment is meant to deter
                specifically D's future misconduct

        e)  Incapacitation: Punish so perpetrator will not be able to
            hurt anyone else

            (i) Works by definition (social physics)

            (ii) Involves weighting costs of certain types of crimes,
                 perpetrators, and violations

                 (1) Both in a deontological sense and a
                     monetary/societal sense

                 (2) Many jurisdictions have risk score tests based on
                     age, education, criminal history and more

            (iii) General Incapacitation: imprison everyone at risk of
                  committing another crime

            (iv) Selective Incapacitation: Only punish people most
                 likely to commit serious crimes at high rates

                 (1) 6% of people commit 50% of crime

        f)  Rehabilitation: D's punishment prevents crime by altering
            his behavior

            (i) Vitiello: "\[M\]oral imperative to offer the offender a
                chance at moral transformation."

    C.  **Model Penal Code 1.02(2): Purposes**

        a)  to prevent the commission of offenses; (Deterrence)

        b)  to promote the correction and rehabilitation of offenders;
            (Rehabilitation)

        c)  to safeguard offenders against excessive, disproportionate
            or arbitrary punishment;

            (i) Could be based of negative retribution

            (ii) Could be based of principle of marginal deterrence (see
                 above)

        d)  to give fair warning of the nature of the sentences...;

            (i) Relates to (constitutionally required) notice

            (ii) Assumes rational person with the ability to regulate
                 their actions

        e)  to differentiate among offenders with a view to a just
            individualization in their treatment;

            (i) Could relate to a couple of the theories (including
                retribution)

        f)  The last three subsections speak about good administration
            and use of science

        g)  The proposed revision to this section more clearly embraces
            retribution and other theories of utilitarianism. It's a
            smorgasbord

    D.  **Criticisms**

        a)  While some like to show how these theories can work
            together, in reality, they often clash

            (i) If they were all commensurate, we would not need/have
                all of them

        b)  What drives punishment in our criminal justice system is
            social forces, not any of these theories

            (i) Nietzsche showed we don't know why we punish

            (ii) Foucault showed we've evolved towards a system of
                 punishment that embraces correction

                 (1) Thesis: We no longer punish people for their acts,
                     but for who they are

                 (2) Transformation of petty crimes into moral wrongs:
                     birth of the penitentiary

                 (3) Moralization of behavior keeps people from
                     questioning & criticizing the system

                 (4) Discipline became a way of regulating bodies

                 (5) Prisons are a form of disciple where criminals
                     internalize their punishment and are taught to act
                     correctly

                 (6) All this discipline relates to creating good
                     workers and the industrial revolution

III. **How Do We Punish?**

     A.  **Truth and Punishment**

         a)  Foucault: The truth we believe is produced by judicial
             forms

             (i) Trial by combat had strict rules. Necessary to allow
                 god to guide the hand of the righteous

             (ii) Ordeals like one's where the accused were thrown into
                  the water and then sunk or floated also showed if they
                  were accepted or rejected by god

             (iii) Social tests where one won by having more respected
                   people swear for them showed who was the better man

         b)  Langbein: In Pre-Enlightenment Continental Europe, torture
             was a method used to procure truth from the accused and use
             a basis for their ultimate punishment

             (i) Torture enabled direct, not circumstantial evidence
                 (history of two eye witness and confession)

             (ii) Torture was meant to be safeguard used just on those
                  who were very likely guilty

                  (1) Torture was highly regimented

                  (2) Only employed in the face of half-truths which
                      already implicated somebody's guilt

                  (3) This didn't work out all that well

             (iii) We have Same problem today "it is not possible to
                   make coercion compatible with truth"

             (iv) In England there was no torture because their justice
                  system was predicated less on absolute truth, more on
                  the jury, the "wisdom of the countryside"

         c)  Bernard Harcourt, "Post-Modern Meditations on Punishment"

             (i) Punishment is not "rational," but is culturally
                 determined

                 (1) E.g., deterrence, racial profiling, "order
                     maintenance" policing

             (ii) Each is justified as being "rational" or "efficient,"
                  but are based on assumptions and predictive tools that
                  are not reliable and/or biased.

             (iii) Solution: Randomization

             (iv) How to Use:

                  (1) Critique policies/laws that purport to rely on
                      empirical data

                  (2) Make point that law is culturally determined &
                      contains ideology beneath it

     B.  **The Criminal Justice System**

         a)  This term began to come into vogue in the 60s

             (i) The word system is used to make us feel satisfied with
                 the way things are done as if the way things are
                 supposed to work and that they work well

                 (1) Related to operations research which began in WWII

                 (2) Enables us to accept the truth and rightness of
                     what happens to criminals

         b)  There really is no system. Just a lot of related and
             overlapping parts

             (i) 96% pleas

         c)  This area is mostly regulated by statutes but there is some
             common law and const principles

**Constitutional Limitations**

A.  **Vagueness and Indefiniteness**

    a)  Harcourt: The Illusion of Order: Broken Windows policing tactics
        and theory is based of bogus science and racist assumptions. It
        doesn't work.

        (i) Proponents of Broken Windows Policing 🡪 Order in the
            community may influence the behavior of neighborhood
            residents and outsiders

        (ii) May improve the quality of life/decrease serious criminal
             activity

        (iii) This position is popular

        (iv) **[Harcourt]{.underline}**: Empirical analysis (in NJ)
             finds no correlation between disorder and most crimes
             (theft, physical assault, burglary, and rape)

<!-- -->

I.  **Common Law Requirements**

    A.  **Actus Reus**

        a)  Kelman Article: The way we unconsciously and consciously
            portray and read facts shape the way we make the (sometimes
            seemingly obvious) legal conclusion

            (i) Main subconscious elements: time framing,
                joining/disjoining actions, broad v. narrow views of
                intent/defendant

                (1) The longer, the more joining and the more broad, the
                    more political questions come in

    B.  **Causation**

        a)  Prof thinks you can reduce everything to probability

            (i) Doyle Hamm case- low probability that they could get
                into his veins was tested when they tried

            (ii) There is also probability relating to probable cause

            (iii) The law never gets precise in these cases nothing ever
                  gets quantified (aside for more likely than not being
                  \>50%)

                  (1) this lack of quantifying becomes a way for lawyers
                      and judges to use their own personal analysis (and
                      subjective ideas of blameworthiness)

                  (2) 1935- IL Dept of Corrections hires actuary to
                      calculate who will violate parole

            (iv) Perhaps mathematizing would just delude people into
                 thinking there is objectivity- even though there are a
                 lot of choices going on in mathematizing- especially
                 because foreseeability is always going to be skewed by
                 the fact that we had a negative outcome in this case

IV. **Capital Punishment**

    A.  **Death Penalty Jurisprudence**

        a)  3 historical stages to death penalty in US

            (i) Antebellum period: automatic DP if convicted of certain
                crimes

            (ii) 1860s-1960s: increased (approaching absolute)
                 discretion of judge/jury to impose DP

            (iii) Post [Furman/Gregg]{.underline}: guided jury (and
                  judge) discretion

        b)  [McGauthu v. CA]{.underline} (1971): SCOTUS rejects DP
            challenge to DP

        c)  [Furman v. GA]{.underline} (1972): SCOTUS strikes down DP on
            8^th^ Amd grounds

            (i) No controlling rationale. Certainly did not say the
                death penalty was *per se* unconstitutional

        d)  States respond by reenacting death penalty statutes: 4 main
            types

            (i) Pyramid (ex. GA, specifically approved of in
                [Gregg]{.underline} (1976))

                (1) Murder🡪aggravated murder (specifically
                    defined)🡪aggravating circumstance🡪death

                (2) All these elements have statutory definitions

                (3) The death sentence is only imposed upon the
                    recommendation of the jury (or judge)

            (ii) Weighing (ex. AL)

                 (1) First have a trial for a (specifically defined)
                     capital crime

                 (2) Second jury weighs aggravating and mitigating
                     circumstances and makes recommendation

            (iii) Special Questions (ex. TX, specifically approved of in
                  [Jurek]{.underline} (1976))

                  (1) Jury asked specific questions at the end of the
                      sentencing phase, if they answer yes to each one
                      then death is necessarily imposed. A new one
                      basically asks for a jury recommendation

            (iv) Mandatory (ex. NC, Ruled unconstitutional in
                 [Woodson]{.underline})

        e)  Note inherent conflict in DP jurisprudence between
            individualized sentencing and consistency

        f)  SCOTUS has carved out thing from the death penalty ex.
            mentally retarded, juveniles, jud override

        g)  Death penalty in practice today

            (i) Bifurcated proceedings

            (ii) Most have jury sentencing

            (iii) Few states (ex. AZ) have judge sentencing

            (iv) Consideration of aggravators/mitagators (or special
                 questions)

            (v) Individualized sentencing determination

            (vi) appellate review

            (vii) stages of collateral review (the sheet from the
                  beginning of the semester

        h)  Stephen Bright: Whether or not D gets DP depends too much on
            if he can afford a good lawyer

            (i) This is reprehensible and a breakdown of the adversarial
                systtem

        i)  Steiker & Steiker: DP jurisprudence is an ineffective
            administrative tool but an effective legitimating tool. This
            legitimization had effects on 3 levels

            (i) Makes those involved in administering the DP in specific
                cases more comfortable with their role

            (ii) Makes the American public more comfortable with the
                 capital punishment system

            (iii) Makes the American public more comfortable with entire
                  legal system and social order

    B.  **Race and the Death Penalty**

        a)  Baldus study those convicted of killing white victims are
            4.3 times likely to get DP than those convicted of killing
            black victims

            (i) This exaggerated risk is most highlighted in mid-raange
                cases

            (ii) This indicates that DP administration discriminates on
                 race lines by valuing white lives more than black lives

        b)  Can one explain this discrepancy as facially based on
            anything besides race?

            (i) Class differences. People value poor lives less than
                rich lives (especially when prosecutors take donations
                from families who have a member killed and then perp
                gets the DP) and black victims usually come from poorer
                segments of the population

            (ii) Perhaps relates to differences in jury makeup which
                 relates to historical (but still racist) factors

        c)  Charles Lawrence: The big problem is not conscious bias but
            rather implicit bias

            (i) "The intent requirement is a centerpiece in an ideology
                of equal opportunity that legitimizes the continued
                existence of racially and economically discriminatory
                conditions and rationalizes the superordinate status of
                privileges whites."

            (ii) Cannot find racial motivation by looking solely for
                 conscious discrimination

            (iii) Must look instead at the challenged policy's "cultural
                  meaning"

                  (1) If people view a policy and its effects in racial
                      terms that indicates that the beliefs and
                      motivations which gave rise to the policy were
                      racially based as well

                  (2) It seems the cultural understanding of the Baldus
                      study would certainly be in racial terms

V.  **Justifications and Excuses**

    A.  **Self-defense**

        a)  Issues in self-defense:

            (i) Subjective v. Objective belief

            (ii) Imminence of harm

            (iii) Necessity to use the force to protect

            (iv) More stringent rules of use of deadly force

            (v) Different rules if self-defender provoked the situation

            (vi) Duty to retreat

            (vii) Mistake regarding necessity or effects of deadly force

            (viii) Time-framing is essential

    B.  **Law Enforcement Use of Force**

Professor wants to add gradations and time framing to this analysis.
Police should have to start with threating to shoot, then draw weapons,
then shoot at ground etc. Also can decide to analyze the reasonableness
of the belief at every unique use of deadly force (trigger pull)

C.  **Insanity**

    a)  Background

        (i) Prisons are biggest provider of mental health services.

        (ii) Big change in mental hospital population. Prof found that
             as one pop goes down the other goes up in US and Europe.
             But the competition is different. US mental hospital were
             mostly white, older, and split evenly by sex. Prisons are
             mostly black, male, and young.

        (iii) These populations could relate to financial constraints
              and who the public thinks is dangerous

    b)  [Durham]{.underline} (DC 1954): No guilt if D's conduct was the
        product of mental disease or defect.

        (i) Prof likes this deconstructive test but it has been rejected

    c)  Studies show that the standard used has negligible impact on
        pleading and acquittal rates

        (i) Prof: this is since jurors are probably basically applying a
            [Durham]{.underline} standard

VI. **Expanding Liability**

    A.  **Attempt**

        a)  See slide for types of expanding liability and their
            corresponding issues

        b)  Should attempt different from success? (Greg thinks no)

            (i) Consider it from various theories of punishment

        c)  Perhaps distinguish between 2 types of attempt:

            (i) Started down a path to a crime and stopped or didn't get
                there (less culpable)

            (ii) Did everything but just missed (more culpable)

        d)  Issues in attempt liability

            (i) Criminalize or no

            (ii) Grading of punishment

                 (1) MPC: same (raises issues of marginal deterrence)

                 (2) Most states: Less (raises Greg's blood pressure)

            (iii) Racial prejudice's and in (mis)interpreting acts

            (iv) Mens Rea

            (v) The actions required (first step, last step, unequivocal
                action)

            (vi) Withdrawal and abandonment

            (vii) Impossibility

                  (1) Legal impossibility=good defense

                  (2) Factual impossibility=no defense

        e)  Racial prejudice often plays a role in assessing a person's
            intention. This is not good

            (i) [McQuirter v. State]{.underline} (AL 1953): Court relied
                on an antebellum case saying the jury can take into
                account social condition and customs based on racial
                differences in determining intent

    B.  **Complicity**

        a)  This same level of crime/punishment for complicity may
            raises marginal deterrence issues

    C.  **Conspiracy**

        a)  Conspiracy has many advantages for prosecutors

            (i) Hearsay can come in if part of conspiracy or even to
                prove a conspiracy ("bootstrapping")

                (1) Conspiracy needs to be ongoing to use this exception
                    unless there is an express agreement to conceal the
                    conspiracy ([Krulewitch)]{.underline}

            (ii) Allows for joint trial of conspirators (gets a lot of
                 evidence in)

            (iii) Gives you many options of where to have the trial

            (iv) Basically gets rid of statute of limitations issues

                 (1) Only starts to run after the last act of the
                     conspiracy is completed

            (v) Can punish twice. Once for the substantive offense, once
                for the conspiracy

                (1) MPC limits this to cases where the conspiracy is
                    broader than the offenses charged

            (vi) Pinkerton rule

VII. **Conclusion**

     a)  Layers of law

         (i) Sources of authority

         (ii) Legal reasoning

         (iii) Legal history

         (iv) Establishing and legitimating a social order (biggest,
              most basic layer)

              (1) See Homer's chariot race, antebellum cases

     b)  Law imposes an order and political economy. It distributes
         wealth, power, status, and reputation

     c)  There is no "correct" ordering, just different ones

     d)  Be weary of claims to truth, science, objectivity and
         efficiency. These are most powerful tool
