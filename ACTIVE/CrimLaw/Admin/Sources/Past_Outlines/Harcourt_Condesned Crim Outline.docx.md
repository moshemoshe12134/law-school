I.  **Constitutional Limitations**

    A.  **Legality**

        a)  Action must be criminalized by statue in order to be
            punished ([Keeler]{.underline})

        b)  Statues must provide sufficient notice that a certain action
            will be considered a crime ([Keeler]{.underline})

        c)  Common law changes to common law criminal doctrine or even
            criminal statutory interpretation don not violate due
            process unless "unexpected and indefensible"
            ([Rogers]{.underline})

    B.  **Vagueness and Indefiniteness**

        a)  Statutes that vague enough to give law enforcement the
            ability to exercise their power arbitrarily under that
            statute are void ([Morales]{.underline})

            (i) Plurality wanted to add a second prong: If the statute
                does not give fair notice to people what a violation
                consists of

                (1) If the statute gives the police the ability to
                    exercise their power arbitrarily

    C.  **Status Crimes**

        a)  Cannot criminalize a specific status, (ex. being addicted to
            drugs, [Robinson]{.underline}). This is violate 8^th^ amd

            (i) Perhaps indicates the constitution requires a crime
                needs to have a (voluntary) action component

II. **Common Law Requirements**

    A.  **Actus Reus**

        a)  Blackstone: To punish someone there must be a vicious will
            and a voluntary act

            (i) Do not punish from crimes in one's head

        b)  MPC 1.13(9): Defines possible "elements of an offense

            (i) Conduct

            (ii) Attendant circumstance

            (iii) Result of conduct

        c)  MPC 2.01. A person is not guilty of an offense unless his
            liability is based on conduct (ala 1.13(9)(i) which includes
            a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which
            he is physically capable.

            (i) Omissions are not punishable unless:

                (1) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law
                    defining the offense; or

                (2) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise
                    imposed by law.

            (ii) Possession can be an act in certain circumstances

        d)  Whether a certain element of a crime is "conduct" or a
            attendant circumstance has implication regarding whether it
            needs to be voluntary or not. (Conduct=yes, AC=no
            [Martin]{.underline}).

        e)  Time framing can have important ramification regarding the
            "voluntariness" of conduct

            (i) The decision to enter a car can be seen as the voluntary
                action in a criminal crash ([Decina]{.underline})

        f)  An omission can only be criminal if: ([Jones]{.underline})

            (1) A statute imposed a duty

            (2) D had a specific status relationship towards neglected
                persons

            (3) D contractually assumed the duty to care for it
                neglected person

            (4) D voluntarily assumed care for neglected person and then
                secluded it

    B.  **Mens Rea:**

        a)  Criminal statutes often include references to various mental
            states (mens=mental, rea=thing)

            (i) Prescribing/requiring different levels of mens rea
                enables us to punish in varying gradations

        b)  "Malice" example. Options:

            (i) "Wickedly:" D must only have been intended to do
                something bad when taking the action (rejected in
                [Cunningham]{.underline} and [Faulkner]{.underline})

            (ii) Professor Kenny (accepted in [Cunningham]{.underline}):

                 (1) An actual intention to do the particular kind of
                     harm that in fact was done; or

                 (2) Recklessness as to whether such harm should occur
                     or not (i.e., the accused has **foreseen** that the
                     particular kind of harm **might** be done and yet
                     has gone on to take the risk of it).

            (iii) Intent or D knew the probable result of his action
                  would be the criminally defined harm and did the act
                  anyways ([Faulkner]{.underline})

        c)  MPC 2.02: Sets forth 4 categories. Lower ones also include
            higher ones.

            (i) Purposely

                (1) Defined differently as it relates to conduct/results
                    of conduct ("conscious object") and as relating to
                    attendant circumstances "must be aware of")

            (ii) Knowingly

                 (1) Defined differently for conduct/attendant
                     circumstances (seems to relate to knowledge of high
                     probability, see sub. sec. 7) and for results of
                     conduct ("practically certain"

            (iii) Recklessly

                  (1) This is the assumed mens rea if nothing else is
                      specified

            (iv) Negligently

            (v) Mens rea applies to all "material elements of an
                offense."

            (vi) If a statute sets out the level of culpability (mens
                 rea) required for one material element but is silent on
                 others, assume the specified mens rea applies to each
                 material element

III. **Homicide**

     A.  **Intended Killings---Murder**

         a)  Blackstone/Coke: Under common law, **murder**, as
             distinguished from manslaughter, is defined as an unlawful
             killing of a person by a person with "malice aforethought"

         b)  Manslaughter is unlawful homicide without malice

         c)  Eventually state began distinguishing between different
             degrees of murder and manslaughter, primarily to enable
             themselves to punish different types of homicides
             differently

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Type of Homicide                 Old Common Law PA       NY       MPC
  -------------------------------- -------------- -------- -------- ------
  Premeditation                    U              U-1      U-2      U

  Intent to cause death            U              U-1      U-2      U

  Intent to inflict serious bodily U              U-3      A-1      ?
  harm

  Criminal Negligence              A-IV           A-IV     CNH      CNH
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEY: U=Murder, A=Manslaughter, CNH=Crim Negligent Homicide, V=Voluntary,
IV=Involuntary, #=dg

d)  Comments on above table

    (i) PA treats felony murder more harshly than other non-intentional
        killings

    (ii) NY has many clawbacks for a felony murder charge

    (iii) MPC has no gradations within the categories

e)  CA has an old-school, rather colorful homicide statute, which still
    speaks about "malice"

f)  "Premeditation." Requires strong evidence of (i), or some evidence
    of (ii) and (i) or (iii) ([Robinson]{.underline})

    (i) Facts of planning activity

    (ii) Facts of motive relation to "prior relationships" between D and
         the victim

    (iii) Manner of the killing indicate it was carried out according to
          a preconceived design

g)  Premeditation requires some time between forming the intent to kill
    and the actual killing ([Guthrie]{.underline})

    (i) Other jurisdictions will disagree and say that intent alone will
        suffice to establish premeditation and that just pulling the
        trigger of a gun aimed at someone can establish intend

h)  Problems and MPC changes with premeditation

    (i) Distinguishing premeditation from a non-premediated intent to
        kill is very important in jurisdiction where this is used in
        determining whether or not to employ the death penalty

    (ii) How can one distinguish premeditation from intent, especially
         in states which hold intent (premeditation?) can be established
         instantaneously (ex. consciously pulling a trigger)

    (iii) MPC gets rid of premeditation

          (1) Premeditation can actually be morally superior to impulse
              in some cases (ex. [Forest]{.underline})

<!-- -->

B.  **Intended Killings---Manslaughter**

    a)  Murder can be mitigated to manslaughter based on the
        circumstances surrounding the killing

    b)  When thinking mitigating homicide to manslaughter, there are 2
        spectrums:

        (i) Objective v. Subjective

        (ii) Categorical (specifically defined) rules v. standards

    c)  The definitions range over time and place

        (i) Old Common law: focused on "heat of passion" and types of
            "provocations"

            (1) Objective: judged against "an ordinarily reasonable
                person" or "ordinary men"

        (ii) [Girouard]{.underline}: Objective ("ordinary man") and
             categorical (Only certain situations, which are
             predetermined by law, count as a "provocation" that can
             lead to legally significant "passion")

        (iii) [Maher]{.underline}: Objective ("ordinary human nature')
              and standards-based (speaks about how 2 identical cases
              cannot be found and that provocations cannot fit into
              model)

        (iv) 9^th^ Circuit (pg 444): This circuit laid out a rather
             objective standard ("naturally cause a reasonable
             person...") that is also rather open to a standards
             approach ("degree\[s\] of passion")

        (v) MPC Approach: 2 step test to determine if D acted "under the
            influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for
            which there is reasonable explanation or excuse" If the
            particular D in fact acted under "extreme emotional
            disturbance" (EED)

            (1) Whether D acted under the influence of EED is a
                completely subjective test

            (2) If there is a "reasonable explanation or excuse" for the
                (EED) as determined "from the viewpoint of a person in
                D's situation under the circumstances as D believed them
                to be." This is half-subjective: You figure out what D's
                situation was and then determine what a reasonable
                response would be to that situation from an objective,
                ordinary person's perspective. You don't imagine that
                you are D, standing in D's shoes. imagine ordinary
                person standing in shoes that are D's size.

            (3) This "situation" element of the MPC is designed to be
                ambiguous. It basically allows a jury to decide whether
                it wants to empathize with D or not. (Harcourt does not
                like this)

    d)  At the center of this discussion about what should be or should
        not be considered when thinking about mitigating to manslaughter
        is how to decide what evidence to admit or exclude

C.  **Unintended Killings---Murder and Manslaughter**

    a)  Levels of liability are supposed to reflect a different level of
        blameworthiness

    b)  You can do this analysis for culpability for unintended killings
        across 3 planes

        (i) Awareness v Cluelessness

        (ii) \% risk of death

        (iii) Degree of care taken

    c)  Extreme recklessness can lead to a murder charge (ex. playing
        RUS roulette with friend, [Malone]{.underline})

    d)  Involuntary manslaughter generally involves, at common law,
        an (1) intentional failure \[the act\] (2) that causes (3) death
        of (4) another.

    e)  Manslaughter for death caused by reckless action, an action
        through which D consciously disregards a substantial and
        unjustifiable risk of causing death (ex. ski instructor skiing
        ad dangerously high speeds near others, the risk need not be
        \>50%, [Hall]{.underline})

    f)  Recklessness, even though omissions can lead to a manslaughter
        charge (ex. owner of night club who new the venue was not in
        compliance with safety regulations and even planned not be in
        compliance with them liable for deaths from fire in club
        [Welansky]{.underline}):

    g)  Sometime even plain negligence may result in manslaughter charge
        (ex. baby dies after parents know it's sick but don't bring it
        to doctor, [Williams]{.underline}, overruled by statute)

    h)  MPC has its own levels of liability with definitions

        (i) Extreme recklessness=murder= recklessness "under
            circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value
            of human life."

        (ii) "Recklessness"=Manslaughter="conscious disregard for human
             life"

        (iii) "Criminal Negligence"=CNH= "should be aware of a
              substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material
              element exists or will result from his conduct." Must
              amount to gross deviation from standard of care

D.  **Felony Murder**

    a)  This moves you from manslaughter (recklessness) to murder

    b)  Perhaps limit to felonious actions known to be dangerous and
        likely to cause death ([Serene]{.underline})

    c)  Perhaps impose strict liability with no foreseeability
        requirement (ex. force manger into office during robbery and
        dies of heart attack due to stress and pre-existing condition
        [Stamp]{.underline}):

    d)  Arguments against strict liability for felony murder

        (i) Law&Econ: eliminates marginal deterrence

        (ii) Common Sense: If no foreseeability, cannot moderate actions

             (1) Ability to moderate actions is necessary from both
                 deterrence and retribution

    e)  MPC 210.2(1)(b): Creates a **rebuttable presumption** of extreme
        recklessness for felony murder

    f)  Two options for analyzing causation in felony murder

        (i) Agency Theory: D only liable for killings immediately caused
            by him a co-felon ([Canola]{.underline})

        (ii) Proximate Cause Theory: Adopts a foreseeability,
             blameworthiness standard from torts (NJ)

             (1) D can be liable for a someone being killed during the
                 felony even if it's a bystander, a co-D and even if
                 person is killed by a bystander or the intended victim

             (2) Many proximate-cause states explicitly carve out deaths
                 of Co-Ds. D not liable for this

E.  **Causation**

    a)  Causation is a necessary factor in result-based crimes

    b)  Need to investigate 3 things: (See MPC 2.03)

        (i) But for cause

            (1) Wide set of causes that are necessarily related to the
                result.

            (2) Necessary but not sufficient

        (ii) Proximate/Legal cause

             (1) Usually relates to foreseeability and notions of
                 blameworthiness

             (2) Usually sufficient along with but for cause to
                 establish liability

        (iii) Intervening cause: the existence of such a cause could
              relieve a D of liability even when D was both but for and
              proximate cause

    c)  Various standards for defenses based on intervening causes or
        unforeseeable results

        (i) Only not liable for "highly extraordinary" consequences
            ([Acosta]{.underline}) Very broad in imposing liability

        (ii) MPC 2.03: no liability for consequences "too remote or
             accidental in its occurrence." Less broad

        (iii) Liable if the result is foreseeable as reasonably related
              to D's acts ([Arzon]{.underline}, [Warner]{.underline}).
              Narrower

        (iv) Note, these standards could be understood as applying both
             to the unforeseeability of the result in general and to the
             relevance of an intervening cause

    d)  Prosecution would want focus on the foreseeing causing the
        result in general and the defense would say you have to have
        foreseen to cause result in the way it happened

    e)  Also, these seem like objective measures, but defense would try
        to find room for subjectivity

IV. **Capital Punishment**

    A.  **Death Penalty Jurisprudence**

        a)  [McGauthu v. CA]{.underline} (1971): SCOTUS rejects DP
            challenge to DP

        b)  [Furman v. GA]{.underline} (1972): SCOTUS strikes down DP on
            8^th^ Amd grounds

            (i) No controlling rationale. did not say the death penalty
                was *per se* unconstitutional

        c)  States respond by reenacting death penalty statutes. Most
            are approved of in [Gregg]{.underline}

        d)  [Furman/Gregg]{.underline} set up polar opposite goals in DP
            administration: consistency v. individualized dignity and
            sentencing

            (i) Scalia/Thomas say there is no constitutional requirement
                of individualized discretion

        e)  [Atkins v. VA]{.underline} (2002): Cannot give DP to the
            "mentally retarded"

            (i) Insufficient blameworthiness, impossible to deter, and
                its considered inhumane by the world

            (ii) Dissent disputes the lack of blameworthiness and
                 absence of deterrence

        f)  SCOTUS has carved out thing from the death penalty ex.
            mentally retarded, juveniles, jud override

    B.  **Race and the Death Penalty**

        a)  Baldus study those convicted of killing white victims are
            4.3 times likely to get DP than those convicted of killing
            black victims

            (i) Indicates DP administration discriminates on race lines
                by valuing white lives\>black lives

        b)  [McClesky v. Kemp]{.underline} (1987): Baldus study does not
            invalidate a DP conviction

            (i) Can't bring EP challenge since this requires a showing
                of purposeful discrimination in this specific case on in
                implementing the policy

                (1) Note, This is practically impossible to do in a DP
                    case since the decision-making is so diffuse

                (2) In challenges to jury composition, SCOTUS shifts the
                    burden to the state to prove no discrimination
                    ([Batson]{.underline}). SCOTUS clearly did not treat
                    [McClesky]{.underline} as a jury composition case.

            (ii) 8^th^ Amd challenges require showing an "unacceptable
                 risk" of cruel & unusual punishment, but:

                 (1) Study doesn't show an "unacceptable risk" of racial
                     prejudice influencing a jury's decision

                 (2) Refuses to assume that the unexplained discrepancy
                     is invidious

                 (3) Also balances this "risk" against the importance of
                     discretion in the criminal justice system

            (iii) Realist analysis: Investigating racial inputs into
                  discretion will destroy the criminal justice system

V.  **Justifications and Excuses**

    A.  **Justification v. Excuse**

        a)  Justification: implies D has the right to do this

            (i) Must be specifically outlined in code.

            (ii) Burden **on** state to prove lack of justification

            (iii) Third parties can assist others in their justified
                  actions

        b)  Excuse: Implies D did not have right to do this, but we
            should cut him some slack

            (i) No great need to spell these out in a code.

            (ii) Burden on D to prove existence of excuse

            (iii) Third parties cannot benefit from another's excuse

    B.  **Self-defense**

        a)  Self-defense is justification of necessity. It's temporal:
            contextual, specific, & time-bound ([Peterson]{.underline})

        b)  Classic standard ([Peterson]{.underline})

            (i) Defender must believe he was imminent peril of death or
                serious bodily injury and his response was necessary to
                save himself from harm

            (ii) Need actual, apparent, unlawful, and immediate threat
                 to use of force

        c)  Subjective v. Objective

            (i) MPC: subjective, with clawback for reckless/negligent
                appraisal of situation

            (ii) NY: Semi-objective: D "reasonably believes:"
                 ([Goetz]{.underline}): Can be informed by the case's
                 and D's specific circumstances

            (iii) [Peterson]{.underline}: Objective

        d)  MPC Self-defense rules

            (i) 3.04: In general, use of force "is justifiable when the
                actor believes that such force is immediately necessary
                for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of
                unlawful force by such other person on the present
                occasion."

            (ii) 3.04: Use of **deadly** force requires threat of
                 serious harm, kidnapping or sexual intercourse

                 (1) How to define serious harm varies across
                     jurisdictions (CA requires medical condition and
                     temporary impairment of condition, IL also has a
                     rather high bar, in NY cuts don't count)

            (iii) 3.09: Clawback. If subjective belief was made
                  unreasonably or recklessly the no justification for
                  offenses only requiring mens rea of recklessness or
                  negligence (ex. Manslaughter, CNH)

        e)  Battered Woman Syndrome: Women killed abusive husbands and
            claimed self-defense

            (i) [Kelly]{.underline}: Expert testimony regarding BTS must
                be allowed in order to assist jury in assessing a
                woman's and subjective belief and credibility in
                describing the incident. Expert may not testify as to
                the reasonableness of the woman's actions

            (ii) [Norman]{.underline}: Woman cannot use BTS to bolster
                 self defense claim after killing husband in his sleep.
                 There was no "imminent" impending harm

                 (1) Case shows difficulty of fitting this newly
                     recognized scenario into a legal defense designed
                     for bar-room brawls and makes you question the
                     wisdom of the imminence requirement

        f)  Duty to retreat

            (i) Old rule: Always duty to retreat. (Ability to retreat is
                fatal to defense of necessity)

            (ii) Castle exception: there is no duty to retreat when
                 attack in one's home (MPC)

            (iii) Many states have passes "Stand your ground law" which
                  abrogates the duty to retreat

                  (1) Ex. FL. Subject to clawback that there is a duty
                      to retreat if D "initially provoked" the use of
                      force against himself. If he did, he must "exhaust
                      every means of escape"

                  (2) Also flips burden to police to find probable cause
                      that such self-defense force was exercised
                      improperly before even arresting someone claiming
                      to have acted in self defense

    C.  **Law Enforcement Use of Force**

        a)  Constitutional (4^th^ amd) regulations on LEUF: there must
            be probable cause to believe the suspect poses a significant
            threat of death or serious physical injury to officer or
            other ([Garner]{.underline})

        b)  Statutory regulations

            (i) Prosecutor brings charges and Police officer invokes
                statutory right to use force in self defense

                (1) All prosecutor needs to convict is probable cause

        c)  NY 35.30.1: Objective "reasonable" standard for police use
            of force to protect against belief that force will be used.
            Can only use deadly force if, furthermore:

            (i) Its necessary to effectuate an arrest for certain
                enumerated, egregious felonies; or

            (ii) The offense committed or attempted to be committed was
                 felony and, in the arrest, attempt the suspect resists
                 or tries to escape custody and the suspect is armed; or

            (iii) Regardless of the offense, officer believes deadly
                  force was necessary to defend against the use or
                  imminent use of deadly force by the suspect

        d)  MPC 3.07: Deadly force is only justified if it's by a peace
            officer, in relations to a felony, and the use of force will
            not subject others to harm and the actor (subjectively)
            believes:

            (i) The crime included the use or threatened use of
                threatened force; or

            (ii) There is a substantial risk that suspect will cause
                 death/serious injury if apprehension is delayed

            (iii) The subjective standard is subject to the clawback in
                  3.09

                  (1) Prof thinks racial beliefs cut against
                      reasonableness but for subjective belief

        e)  Professor wants to add gradations and time framing to this
            analysis. Police should have to start with threating to
            shoot, then draw weapons, then shoot at ground etc. Also can
            decide to analyze the reasonableness of the belief at every
            unique use of deadly force (trigger pull)

        f)  Note, in recent cases police defense is predicated on their
            belief the suspect was armed, but in other cases, like Eric
            Garner's, its about the required level of force require to
            make an arrest

    D.  **Necessity and Duress**

        a)  Three types of compulsion defenses

            (i) Necessity: disaster forces us to break the law (climbers
                break into house during avalanche)

            (ii) Duress: human based compulsion (gun to the head) (see
                 MPC 2.09)

                 (1) Coercion through use of unlawful force

                 (2) Person of reasonable firmness would not be able to
                     resist

            (iii) Choice of lesser evils: two evils in front of you,
                  chose the one that's less bad for society

                  (1) This is a utilitarian justification

        b)  Old Rule: Necessity defense only allowed in self-defense
            ([Dudley & Stevens]{.underline})

        c)  MPC 3.02: Courts should weigh the evils presented by the
            options in the case. If the harm or evil sought to be
            avoided the option D chose is greater than that sought to be
            prevented by the law defining the offense D committed D
            should be acquitted

            (i) Many states who have adopted this have a carveout saying
                this cannot be used for homicide

            (ii) Based on D's subjective appraisal but subject to a
                 clawback similar to MPC 3.09 for negligent appraisal or
                 negligence (some state laws have a "without blame") in
                 getting into the situation

            (iii) Unclear if you focus on retributive theories or
                  consequentialist theories in appraising this

                  (1) If consequentialist, you will have to make awkward
                      determinations about the value of certain things
                      like age, ability, health, etc

        d)  Some choice of evils regimes have a reasonableness
            requirement

        e)  NY necessity/choice of evils statute has an imminence
            requirement for the harm sought to be avoided (and also
            avoids awkward consequentialist analysis according to Prof)

        f)  Weighing example: Prisoner escapes after receiving credible
            rape/murder threats. Did not report the threats to prions
            officials. Found 2 days later 2 hours from prison still in
            prison clothes ([Unger]{.underline})

    E.  **Insanity**

        a)  Competence standard: D "must be able to understand the
            proceedings against him" and be able to "assist in his own
            defense"

        b)  Insanity defense requires conduct result from mental illness

        c)  M'Naughten's Rule=Cognitive insanity standard ("a mental
            disorder causes you to either not know what you are doing or
            not know what you are doing is wrong" (in a moral sense))

        d)  "Irresistible Impulse"=Volitional insanity standard

        e)  [Davis]{.underline} (1897): Has both cognition and volition
            prong. Only need to satisfy one to succeed

            (i) Bar is very high: "incapable" to know right from wrong
                or lack of will "completely destroyed"

        f)  MPC 4.01 ([Blake]{.underline}): Has both cognition and
            volition prong. Only need to satisfy one to succeed

            (i) Relaxes high bar: "No guilt if as a result of mental
                disease or defect D **lacked substantial capacity**
                either to appreciate the criminality \[wrongfulness\] of
                his conduct or to conform his conduct to the
                requirements of law."

        g)  [Durham]{.underline} (DC 1954): No guilt if D's conduct was
            the product of mental disease or defect.

            (i) Prof likes this deconstructive test but it has been
                rejected

        h)  Developments after Hinckley NGRI acquittal:

            (i) Federal law adopted only allowing a cognition defense,
                and with a high bar ([Lyons]{.underline} "unable")

            (ii) Some states create a guilty but mentally ill verdict
                 requiring prison, but with treatment

            (iii) 21 states return to M'N

            (iv) Some states tried to abolish (4 have done so
                 successfully)

            (v) 22 states still have an MPC standard

            (vi) NY's statutes seems to be getting only to cognition but
                 prob thinks you have a window into volition though the
                 "appreciate he consequences of the act" language

        i)  Studies show that the standard used has negligible impact on
            pleading and acquittal rates

            (i) Prof: this is since jurors are probably basically
                applying a [Durham]{.underline} standard

VI. **Expanding Liability**

    A.  **Attempt**

        a)  Attempt is a separate crime for the actual crime

        b)  Issues in attempt liability

            (i) Criminalize or no

            (ii) Grading of punishment

                 (1) MPC: same (raises issues of marginal deterrence)

                 (2) Most states: Less

            (iii) Racial prejudice's and in (mis)interpreting acts

            (iv) Mens Rea

            (v) The actions required (first step, last step, unequivocal
                action)

            (vi) Withdrawal and abandonment

            (vii) Impossibility

                  (1) Legal impossibility=good defense

                  (2) Factual impossibility=no defense

        c)  Perhaps distinguish between 2 types of attempt:

            (i) Started down a path to a crime and stopped or didn't get
                there (less culpable)

            (ii) Did everything but just missed (more culpable)

        d)  Attempt liability usually requires specific intent to commit
            the crime ([Smallwood]{.underline}, NY, CA)

            (1) Can perhaps be able to impute intent with certain
                actions like shooting a gun

        e)  MPC 5.01: For attempt liability, need mens rea of crime
            itself and:

            (i) **purposely** engages in conduct which would constitute
                the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he
                believes them to be; or

            (ii) for a result crime, does or omits to do anything **with
                 the purpose** of causing or **with the belief** (i.e.
                 "knowledge") that it will cause such result without
                 further conduct on his part; or

            (iii) **purposely** does or omits to do anything which,
                  under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is
                  an act or omission constituting a substantial step in
                  a course of conduct **planned** to culminate in his
                  commission of the crime.

        f)  What kind of action is required to establish attempt
            liability? 4 options: (1-3 relate to proximity)

            (i) Action must be in dangerous proximity to crime's
                commission ([Rizzo]{.underline})

            (ii) MPC 5.01: Actor must take "substantial step" towards
                 crime. Lists some steps in 2X negative

            (iii) AZ: "any step"

            (iv) Unequivocal action. Like *res ipsa*. If you are doing
                 this action, you are on your way to a crime

        g)  Withdrawal---MPC 5.01: Affirmative defense that D abandoned
            his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its
            commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
            voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose

        h)  Racial prejudice often plays a role in assessing a person's
            intention ([McQuirter]{.underline})

    B.  **Complicity**

        a)  Complicity is another route to being charged with the
            principal offense itself

            (i) No need to convict principal in order to convict
                accomplice

                (1) Still need to prove a crime occurred

            (ii) Can be charged with complicity for an attempted crime
                 if the crime wasn't completed

        b)  Some jurisdictions require a mens rea of purpose for a
            complicity charge ([Gladstone]{.underline})

        c)  MPC 2.06: Two separate mens rea requirements:

            (i) 2.06(3): For conduct crimes (like selling drugs) the
                accomplice must act with "the purpose of promoting of
                facilitating the commission of the offense" (see
                [Hicks]{.underline} (1893))

            (ii) 2.06(4): For result crimes (like homicide) the
                 accomplice only needs the same mens rea in relation to
                 the result as the principal would need (ex.
                 [Roebuck]{.underline} D lured victim to an apartment
                 complex where the victim was killed. D's recklessness
                 can establish accomplice liability)

            (iii) MPC doesn't resolve the mens rea issue attendant
                  circumstances (ex. complicity in hate crime when you
                  were unaware of the existence of hate)

        d)  Minority Rule: Liable as long as the crime was the
            foreseeable result of D's actions ([Luparello]{.underline})

        e)  Options of what the accomplice's mens rea has to relate to:
            (Any statute can be mapped)

            (i) To "aiding" the principal

                (1) Ex. NY "intent to aid" in principle's "engaging in
                    such conduct" (level=purpose)

            (ii) To the principal's mens rea

                 (1) Ex. CA "knowledge of unlawful purpose"
                     (level=knowledge)

            (iii) To the principal's mens rea and conduct

                  (1) Ex. MPC/IL: "purpose of promoting/facilitating the
                      commission of the offense" (level=purpose)

            (iv) To the end crime

                 (1) Ex. NY: with level of culpability required for the
                     crime itself

        f)  Withdrawal---MPC 2.06(6): no liability if D terminates
            complicity prior to offense's commission &:

            (1) wholly deprives it of effectiveness in the commission of
                the offense; or

            (2) gives timely warning to the law enforcement authorities
                or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the
                commission of the offense.

    C.  **Conspiracy**

        a)  Conspiracy has many advantages for prosecutors

            (i) Hearsay can come in if part of conspiracy or even to
                prove a conspiracy ("bootstrapping")

                (1) Conspiracy needs to be ongoing to use this exception
                    unless there is an express agreement to conceal the
                    conspiracy ([Krulewitch)]{.underline}

            (ii) Allows for joint trial of conspirators (gets a lot of
                 evidence in)

            (iii) Gives you many options of where to have the trial

            (iv) Basically gets rid of statute of limitations issues

                 (1) Only starts to run after the last act of the
                     conspiracy is completed

            (v) Can punish twice. Once for the substantive offense, once
                for the conspiracy

                (1) MPC limits this to cases where the conspiracy is
                    broader than the offenses charged

            (vi) [Pinkerton]{.underline} rule: conspirators can be
                 charged with crimes of co-conspirators they had no
                 knowledge of so long as it was of the character of
                 those envisioned by the conspiracy

                 (1) [Bridges]{.underline}: Offense only must be
                     reasonably foreseeable by D as occurring as part of
                     conspiracy

                 (2) Most modern codes and the MPC reject
                     [Pinkerton]{.underline}

        b)  Actus Reus:

            (i) Agreement

                (1) Can infer agreement from circumstantial evidence
                    (ex. [Interstate]{.underline}: unanimity of the
                    agreements with the theaters and the distributors'
                    knowledge that an absence of unanimity would result
                    in potential profit-loss can allow jurors to infer
                    agreement)

            (ii) Overt act

                 (1) Common law didn't require this

                 (2) Many American statues and MPC (except for
                     1^st^/2^nd^ degree felonies) require this but it's
                     a weak requirement. Only need act to establish the
                     conspiracy has begun, not only in minds

                 (3) Some states (ex. OH, ME) have a "substantial" over
                     act requirement

        c)  Mens Rea:

            (i) Knowledge of the planned criminal activity

            (ii) Intent to paritcipate in the agreed course of conduct
                 in furtherance of the criminal purpose

                 (1) For felonies can perhaps infer intent from
                     knowledge and long period of benefit from crime and
                     failure to report it ([Lauria]{.underline})

                 (2) For misdemeanors (like prostitution) cannot infer
                     intent from knowledge and benefit unless D has a
                     special interest in the activity which, in turn can
                     be shown ([Lauria]{.underline})

                     1.  If he acquired a stake in the venture

                     2.  If there is no legitimate use for the legal
                         goods and services D supplies

                     3.  When the volume of business drawn from the
                         illegal buyer is a grossly disproportionate to
                         any legitimate demand or amount to a high
                         proportion to the seller's total business
