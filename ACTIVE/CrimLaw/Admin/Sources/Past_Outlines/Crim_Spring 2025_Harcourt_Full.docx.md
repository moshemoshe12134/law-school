***Martin v. State* (AL 1944)**

- **Facts**: Martin was drunk on a highway and screaming profane
  language. He was taken to the highway by the cops when arrested, where
  he allegedly committed the proscribed acts.

- **Statute**: "any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in
  any public place where one or more persons are present... and
  manifests a drunken condition by boisterous or indecent conduct, or
  loud and profane discourse, shall, on conviction, be fined..."

- **Issue**: May criminal liability be imposed only if the unlawful
  conduct is committed voluntarily?

- **Holding**: A voluntary act is presumed; accusation of drunkenness
  cannot be established by proof that the accused was involuntarily and
  forcibly carried there by the arresting officer.

- **NOTES**:

  - *People v. Low* (CA 2002): Low taken to jail involuntarily and
    brought in a substance; charged for law. This is different from
    *Martin* because he could have relinquished the drugs before
    entering. Same in *State v. Barnes* (NC 2013); the necessary
    voluntary act occurs when the defendant knowingly possesses the
    controlled substance.

  - Distinguished in *State v. Eaton* (WA 2010): defendant had no
    available choice other than to surrender evidence that would convict
    him of another time.

  - 2nd Circuit has held that an illegal immigrant trying to cross the
    border from NY to Canada could not be convicted for being "found in
    the US because he was returned involuntarily; the opposite is true
    in 9th Circuit.

  - The time framing matters -- if you look solely to the last moments
    in this case, it was not a voluntary act. But, if you look at this
    case from the beginning and say Martin got drunk voluntarily and
    committed a crime for the arrest voluntarily, it all follows (see
    Kelman).

***People v. Newton* (CA 1970)**

- **Facts**: Newton was charged with the murder of a police officer
  after a struggle with a gun. He was found guilty of manslaughter. It
  is possible that Newton was shot first and experienced a "profound
  shock reaction," losing consciousness.

- **Issue**: Was the trial court's failure to give an unconsciousness
  defense prejudicial error?

- **Holding**: Where there is evidence of involuntary unconsciousness
  (not induced by toxication, etc), the refusal of a requested
  instruction on the subject, and its effect as a complete defense if
  found to have existed, is prejudicial error. Here, there was
  conflicting evidence, but some is supported by the inference that the
  defendant was shot before he fired any himself.

***People v. Decina* (NY 1956)**

- **Facts**: Defendant is prone to seizures. He drove on the highway,
  suffered such an attack, and killed four people. Charged with criminal
  negligence in the operation of a vehicle causing death.

- **Issue**: is the defendant's act voluntary for the purposes of actus
  reus?

- **Holding**: Yes. Decina's awareness of his epileptic condition
  coupled with a disregard of the consequences renders him criminally
  liable.

- **Question**: what is the difference between saying Decina should not
  have been driving and Martin should not have been drinking?

  - Martin was drinking in his home; he probably did not know he would
    be arrested and brought into public.

  - Decina knew he was going to be driving and that there was a risk of
    seizure; the risk in the latter case was greater.

  - Kellman: difference in outcomes depends on differences in narrow
    (Martin) or broad (Decina) time framing

## Omissions

There's criminal liability for an omission *only* if there is a legal
duty to perform some act (**MPC §2.01(3)**)

"Most cases where liability for homicide is imposed for a failure to act
are, like the *Jones* case, involuntary manslaughter. Such a case,
however, might be murder if the defendant refused aid with the intention
of causing death, or with full knowledge of a great risk that the
decedent would die." (CB9, 219)

- *Commonwealth v. Pestinkas*, PA Super. Ct. 1992, in which the
  defendant agreed to feed a 92-year-old man, knew he had no other way
  of obtaining food, and let him die of starvation

***Jones v. U.S.* (DC 1962)**

- **Facts**: Defendant found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for
  failure to provide for a ten month old child in her care (facts
  unclear if this person was paid; mother lived with defendant for some
  time. But the defendant had the means to provide for the child.

- **Issue**: In order for a defendant to be convicted of a crime for the
  failure to act, must the prosecution prove that the defendant was
  under a legal duty to act?

- **Holding**: Yes. there are four situations where failure to act may
  constitute a breach of a legal duty: i) when statute imposes a legal
  duty; ii) when one stands in a certain status relationship to
  another; iii) where one has assumed a contractual duty to care for
  another, and ix) where one person has voluntarily assumed the care of
  another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from
  rendering aid.

  - Examples of "certain status relationship to one another" may include
    parent/child; husband/wife; master/apprentice; shipmaster/crew;
    innkeeper/the inebriated

## Time Framing (Kelman)

***Interpretative Construction in the Substantive Criminal Law,* Mark
Kelman**

Four Unconscious Interpretative Constructs

- Broad and narrow time frames: which time frame we take may shape how
  we see something to be either voluntary or involuntary; using time
  framing as an interpretative method blocks the perception of the
  intentionalist or determinist views that could be at stake.
  Time-framing is an interpretive method that blocks the perception that
  intentionalist or determinist issues could be substantively at stake

  - Narrow time framing: Conduct is often deemed involuntary or freely
    willed because we don't consider the defendant's earlier decisions
    that may have put them in a position of choicelessness or because we
    look far back in their history. Buttresses the traditionally
    asserted "intentionalism" of the CJS. Excludes potentially
    explanatory background data.

  - Broad time framing: more often used when deterministic discourse
    supplants the usual intentionalism.

    - I.e., duress, subjective entrapment, provocation, and insanity.
      These doctrines describe how certain blameworthy acts are in fact
      blameless because rooted in or determined by factors that precede
      the criminal incident.

      - incorporate personal history: **insanity,** self-defense
        (reasonableness of person in actor's situation, *Goetz*)

      - Incorporate preceding facts: **duress**, **necessity,
        provocation,** premeditation (*Guthrie*, not *Carroll*)

      - Incorporate antecedent facts: **abandonment**

      - "Broad time-framing is used in the abandonment area because the
        general rule-oriented nature of the criminal law has already
        stumbled in the less rule-like **attempt** area. Attempt law is
        generally problematic in out legal culture because it is
        inexorably less rule-like than the law of consummated harms."

      - "Since we cannot infer blame from a single act, because no such
        act is present in attempting, we move, at the very least, to
        more partial Rule of Law strictures: We try to infer a
        disposition to perform one of the still automatically
        blameworthy acts."

      - "The abandonment defense, then, appears not because a
        forward-looking broad time frame is logically better suited to
        attempt law, but because the always available policy attacks on
        rules are allowed sway only in an area where the rule-form is
        already weakened by the imprecision of the definition of the act
        upon which criminal liability is predicated."

- Disjoined and unified accounts of incidents: should the earlier moment
  be joined with the latter moment? Should we treat all relevant facts
  as constituting a single incident or disjoin into two separate
  incidents? Once this decision is made, the question of criminal
  culpability is "forever biased"

  - "Disjoined time-framing eases flaming practices where an
    exculpatory, broad time-framed determinism presses in the would-be
    condemner"

  - E.g., for theft if you only look at the theft itself and not the
    distribution of property before the theft, you don't have to wonder
    about why property is distributed as it is. So a narrow time framing
    "normalizes, sanitizes, and decriminalizes the property holdings of
    dominating groups" and "decontextualizes, delegitimatizes, and
    thereby criminalizes the activities of the dispossessed." (665)

  - Culpability is biased by the decision

  - 

Narrow time-framing

- US v. Moore - contended that possession of drugs manifests the status
  of an addict. Addicts should not be punished for possessing drugs;
  they do so because they are addicts and their addiction left them
  choiceless

  - Being sick vs. becoming sick is a question of time-framing

Voluntary act requirement

- Martin v. State - defendant was not culpable because he was forced
  onto the highway; an involuntary act cannot give rise to liability

  - Viewed the time frame narrowly

- People v. Decina - defendant was culpable because he made a conscious
  decision to drive, knowing that a seizure was possible

  - Opened up the time frame

Broad time-framing

- Examples include duress, subjective entrapment, provocation, insanity,
  abandonment

- On abandonment, Fletcher argues that once one performs acts indicating
  a firm intention to commit blameworthy criminal acts, there is no
  rational reason not to treat the performance of these acts as
  conclusively presumed proof of criminal intent

Unconscious interpretation

- Broad and narrow time frames

  - The distinction between a one-time, heat-of-the-moment killer and a
    perpetually-enraged killer who suffered years of torture "makes no
    sense as a matter of retribution and only superficial sense in terms
    of deterrence," yet we still make the distinction

- Disjoined and unified accounts

  - May be used to suppress "the recognition of something akin to the
    'justification' of behavior"

  - An otherwise criminal act gains legitimacy because it does not need
    to justify itself

# MENS REA

Refers to the mental awareness or intention that must accompany the
prohibited act, under the terms of a statute.

- Specific intent crimes: require proof of a further purpose in mind.
  May also require actual knowledge or subjective awareness of some
  particular fact thor circumstance in addition to the conduct.
  (Burglary, assault with intent to kill)

- General intent crimes: intent to do an act without any further purpose
  in mind. Defendant only must do some voluntary act. (Trespass,
  battery)

- There are limits on mandatory presumptions -- those the jury is
  required to draw in the absence of contrary evidence. (*Francis v.
  Franklin*: a jury instruction that creates a mandatory rebuttable
  presumption of a defendant's criminal intent violates the Due Process
  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.)

  - Presumptions altogether can be problematic because they can dilute
    the burden of proof requirement and shift it to the defendant

  - In a nutshell, "presumptions are constitutional only when we can
    have confidence that over all criminal cases in general, the
    presumed fact will always be present with the fact used to trigger
    the presumption is present" -- i.e., pointing a gun at someone and
    firing → can assume intent to kill

  - The jury "may" infer other things -- i.e., "possession of recently
    stolen property, if not satisfactorily explained, is ordinarily a
    circumstance from which the jury may infer that the person in
    possession knew that the property had been stolen"

|         |         or the attendant circumstances, he is **aware**    |
|         |         that his conduct is of that nature or that such    |
|         |         circumstances exist; and                           |
|         |                                                            |
|         |     (ii) if the element involves a result of his conduct,  |
|         |          **he is aware that it is practically certain**    |
|         |          that his conduct will cause such a result.        |
|         |                                                            |
|         | (c) Recklessly. A person acts recklessly with respect to a |
|         |     material element of an offense when he **consciously   |
|         |     disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk t**hat |
|         |     the material element exists or will result from his    |
|         |     conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree  |
|         |     that, considering the nature and purpose of the        |
|         |     actor\'s conduct and the circumstances known to him,   |
|         |     its disregard involves a gross deviation from the      |
|         |     standard of conduct that a law‑abiding person would    |
|         |     observe in the actor\'s situation.                     |
|         |                                                            |
|         | (d) Negligently. A person acts negligently with respect to |
|         |     a material element of an offense when **he should be   |
|         |     aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk** that   |
|         |     the material element exists or will result from his    |
|         |     conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree  |
|         |     that **the actor\'s failure to perceive it,            |
|         |     considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and  |
|         |     the circumstances known to him, involves a gross       |
|         |     deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable  |
|         |     person would observe in the actor\'s situation.**      |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(3\) Culpability Required Unless Otherwise Provided. When |
|         | the culpability sufficient to establish a material element |
|         | of an offense is not prescribed by law, such element is    |
|         | established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or       |
|         | **[recklessly]{.underline}** with respect thereto.         |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(4\) Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All    |
|         | Material Elements. When the law defining an offense        |
|         | prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for  |
|         | the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among |
|         | the material elements thereof, such provision shall apply  |
|         | to all the material elements of the offense, **[unless a   |
|         | contrary purpose plainly appears.]{.underline}**           |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(5\) Substitutes for Negligence, Recklessness and         |
|         | Knowledge. When the law provides that negligence suffices  |
|         | to establish an element of an offense, such element also   |
|         | is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or    |
|         | recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an     |
|         | element, such element also is established if a person acts |
|         | purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to  |
|         | establish an element, such element also is established if  |
|         | a person acts purposely. **(Purposely \> Knowingly \>      |
|         | Recklessly \> Negligently)**                               |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(6\) Requirement of Purpose Satisfied if Purpose Is       |
|         | Conditional. When a particular purpose is an element of an |
|         | offense, the element is established although such purpose  |
|         | is conditional, unless the condition negatives the harm or |
|         | evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the        |
|         | offense.                                                   |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(7\) Requirement of Knowledge Satisfied by Knowledge of   |
|         | High Probability. When knowledge of the existence of a     |
|         | particular fact is an element of an offense, such          |
|         | knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high    |
|         | probability of its existence, unless he actually believes  |
|         | that it does not exist.                                    |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(8\) Requirement of Wilfulness Satisfied by Acting        |
|         | Knowingly. A requirement that an offense be committed      |
|         | wilfully is satisfied if a person acts knowingly with      |
|         | respect to the material elements of the offense, unless a  |
|         | purpose to impose further requirements appears.            |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(9\) Culpability as to Illegality of Conduct. Neither     |
|         | knowledge nor recklessness or negligence as to whether     |
|         | conduct constitutes an offense or as to the existence,     |
|         | meaning or application of the law determining the elements |
|         | of an offense is an element of such offense, unless the    |
|         | definition of the offense or the Code so provides.         |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(10\) Culpability as Determinant of Grade of Offense.     |
|         | When the grade or degree of an offense depends on whether  |
|         | the offense is committed purposely, knowingly, recklessly  |
|         | or negligently, its grade or degree shall be the lowest    |
|         | for which the determinative kind of culpability is         |
|         | established with respect to any material element of the    |
|         | offense.                                                   |

***Regina v. Cunningham* (UK 1957)**

- **Facts**: Appellant wrenched the gas meter from the pipes in a
  building and stole it; he did not turn off the gas. This partially
  asphyxiated Mrs. Wade, who was asleep next door.

- **Statute**: "unlawfully and maliciously causing to be taken by Sarah
  Wade a certain noxious thing namely, coal and case, so as thereby to
  endanger her life."

- **Issue**: Did the judge fail to instruct on the meaning of malice
  when he limited the definition of malice to wickedness?

- **Holding**: The term malice in a criminal statute does not mean
  general wickedness, but rather means either (1) an actual intention to
  do the particular kind of harm that was in fact done or (2) reckless
  disregard of a foreseeable risk that the harm would result.

  - Malice requires not merely wickedness; it requires that the
    defendant foresaw and recklessly disregarded the harm caused by his
    actions. Need "foresight of consequence"

***Regina v. Faulkner* (UK 1877)** *D can't be convicted for an
accidental act collateral to the felony that would have been a crime if
intentional*

- **Facts**: Defendant lit a match on the hold of a ship so he could see
  better when stealing rum. The rum caught fire and the entire chip was
  destroyed. At Faulkner's trial, the Crown (plaintiff) argued that
  because Faulkner was committing the felony of theft when the fire
  began, the issue of his intent to start the fire was irrelevant. The
  judge instructed the jury that if the jury found that Faulkner was
  engaged in stealing the rum when the fire started, the jury should
  also find him guilty of setting the ship on fire, even if they found
  that he had no actual intention of burning the vessel.

- **Statute**: Malicious Damage Act, for "maliciously" setting fire to
  the ship.

- **Issue**: Can a defendant who is in the process of committing a
  felony be convicted for an accidental act collateral to the felony
  that would have been a crime if done intentionally?

- **Holding**: No. To constitute an offense under the act, it must be in
  fact intentional and wilful. The crown's proposal is too broad.

- **Important class note**: malice requires that the defendant foresaw
  the disputed consequences.

***State v. Hazelwood* (AK 1997)** *ordinary negligence can be
applicable in a criminal case*

- **Facts**: Defendant spilled 11 million gallons of oil into the sound
  when he ran the tanker into a reef.

- **Statute**: Prosecuted under statute that made it an offense for any
  person to discharge petroleum upon the waters. When committed
  negligently, the offense was designated a misdemeanor.

- **Issue**: Did the trial court err in adopting the ordinary civil
  negligence definition?

- **Holding**: No. "Mens rea requirement in prosecution for negligent
  discharge of oil, arising from accident that occurred as tanker
  captained by defendant ran aground, could be satisfied by civil
  negligence standard, as opposed to criminal negligence standard,"
  which would require more. (West)

- **Notes**: Criminal negligence requires a risk so great that failing
  to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care
  that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. A court can
  apply either standard depending on the reasonableness of the
  expectation of individual conformity to the standard of care. Here,
  either standard reasonably deter the criminal behavior.

***Santillanes v. New Mexico* (NM 1993)**

- **Facts**: Defendant cut his nephew's neck during an altercation and
  was convicted under a child abuse statute.

- **Statute**: Defined offense as "negligently causing a child to be
  placed in a situation that may endanger the child's life or health."
  Mens rea required is criminal negligence, not ordinary civil
  negligence.

- **Issue**: Is a definition of negligence sufficient for civil
  liability warranted?

- **Holding**: No. "The crime should typically refelect a mental state
  warranting such contempt; interpret mens rea element of negligence in
  child abuse statute to require criminal negligence rather than civil."

- **Note**: "when moral condemnation attaches to conviction, crime
  should reflect the mens rea that warrants such contempt." The
  culpability should reflect the seriousness of the crime.

### MENS REA: DISTINGUISHING *HAZELWOOD* FROM *SANTILLANES*

- Statutory language shows two crimes of varying degrees of seriousness

- *Hazelwood* (oil tanker crash -- picked ord. neg.)

  - Petroleum discharge [can]{.underline} be legal with permit/license

  - Typical criminal actors might be experts/experienced and thus can be
    held to a higher standard of care (lower bar for criminality = less
    leeway in deviation from care = higher standard)

- *Santillanes* (child abuse -- picked crim neg.)

  - Child abuse carries with it a lot of moral baggage.

  - Despite the moral baggage, "endangering the child's life or health"
    without more specificity would cover a lot of conduct. Do we want to
    criminalize every negligent act that endangers a child (this could
    happen if we used a lower standard)?

***Elonis v. U.S.* (2015)** "there must be a mens rea attached to
wrongful conduct, even if not explicitly stated in statute"

- **Facts**: Elonis started posting rap songs after his wife left him.
  Convicted for threatening to injure another via interstate commerce.
  In the trial court, E requested instruction that "the government must
  prove that he intended to communicate a true threat"; the district
  court rejected this and adopted a reasonable person approach; there is
  no mens rea in the statute.

- **Issue**: Must the defendant be aware of the threatening nature of
  the communication?

- **Holding**: The defendant must intend to communicate a true threat,
  whether or not a reasonable person would read his words as a threat.
  The conviction cannot stand because the jury was not instructed that
  the government must prove that the defendant intended to communicate a
  true threat.

  - Although there are exceptions, the general rule is that a guilty
    mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every
    crime, and, as such, courts will interpret criminal statutes to
    include broadly-applicable scienter requirements, even where the
    statute by its terms does not contain them." (West)

  - The minimum is negligence.

**Negligence**:

- Generally, criminal negligence requires a more gross deviation from
  the standard of care than civil negligence.

- Some courts interpret criminal negligence to require nothing more than
  ordinary carelessness; others hold that negligence requires a "gross"
  departure from normal standards of care.

- *Hazelwood*: civil negligence may be applied in criminal law.
  *Santillanes*: civil negligence may NOT be applied in criminal law.

- At common law, involuntary manslaughter required gross negligence, not
  ordinary negligence (Cf. *Williams*).

# LIMITS ON PUNISHMENT

Three dimensions:

- Legality: to give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared
  to constitute an offense

- Culpability: to safeguard conduct that is without fault from
  condemnation as criminal

- Proportionality: to differentiate on reasonable grounds between
  serious and minor offenses.

***Keeler v. Superior Court* (CA 1970)**

- Facts: Man intercepts his pregnant ex-wife on a mountain road and says
  he is going to "stomp" the baby out of her; he shoved his knee into
  her abdomen and struck her. Fetus delivered stillborn.

- Statute: murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice
  aforethought.

- Issue: whether or not the fetus was a human being within the meaning
  of the statute, and thereby whether the petitioner can be charged with
  murder.

- Holding: an unborn but viable fetus is not a "human being" under the
  statute because there is a common law "born alive" requirement --
  legislature can change that. Even if the Court could, we could not
  apply it retrospectively in this case because of due process.

***Rogers v. Tennessee* (2001)**

- Facts: the defendant stabbed the victim with a knife; the victim went
  into cardiac arrest, then a coma; he died of related complications 15
  months later. Defendant is convicted of murder despite the common law
  rule; TN Supreme Court sustains conviction while abolishing the common
  law rule.

- Statute: TN had a common law, long-standing rule that homicide could
  only be prosecuted as murder only when the victim had died within a
  year and a day of the defendant's acts.

- Issue: Did TN's abolition of the common law rule (and retroactive
  application to defendant) violate the Due Process or Ex Post Facto
  clause?

- No. Judicial alteration of common law doctrines of criminal law
  violates the principle of fair warning, and must not be given
  retroactive effect, [only where it is unexpected and indefensible by
  reference to the law w]{.underline}hich had been expressed prior to
  the conduct in issue. The common law rule was based on 13th century
  science and obsolete.

***Tomlin v. Hetzel*** **(Harcourt's client)**

- Issue: Whether the Alabama court's decision--that Tomlin's sentence of
  life imprisonment without the possibility of parole did not violate
  the Ex Post Facto Clause--was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable
  application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the
  United States Supreme Court.

- In 1977 and 1978, from plain meaning of the statute, Death Penalty Act
  did not cover the conduct and circumstances alleged against Mr.
  Tomlin.

- "When judicial construction of a criminal statute is unexpected and
  indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to
  the conduct in issue, the construction must not be given retroactive
  effect."

## Vagueness

***Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville* (1972)**

- Facts: defendant is arrested for vagrancy.

- Statute: prohibited several general activities, among them loafing,
  wandering or strolling without any lawful purpose, hanging around
  places where liquor is sold, common night walking, and men "habitually
  living upon the earnings of their wives or minor children," despite
  being able to work.

- Issue: is a statute constitutional if it does not give a person of
  ordinary intelligence fair notice?

- Holding: No, and law enforcement may not have "unfettered discretion."

***City of Chicago v. Morales* (1999)**

- **Facts**: Morales convicted under an ordinance that makes it a crime
  to "remain in any one place with no apparent purpose."

- **Statute**: four predicates -- reasonably believe gang member in a
  public place, loitering, dispersal order, disobey dispersal order

- **Issue**: Is a law unconstitutional under the DPC if it fails to give
  adequate notice or permits arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of
  the law?

- Holding: Yes. The statute is both overbroad and underinclusive.

**Bernard Harcourt: *Illusion of Order***

- The concept of "disorder" is used as a justification for certain
  policing practices (broken windows theory -- idea that visible singles
  of disorder lead to more serious crimes and decay.)

- Critique of broken windows; the perception of disorder is often
  manipulated to control and surveil communities, particularly
  disadvantaged neighborhoods. The idea of disorder is not inherent, but
  socially constructed to support political and legal agendas,
  reinforcing existing social hierarchies.

- Assumption that reducing visible signs of disorder (minor offenses
  like fare evasion, loitering, etc) will prevent more serious crimes is
  flawed; enforcing minor offenses can lead to disproportionate harm to
  certain communities without reducing actual crime rates.

  - Leads to over-policing, racial profiling, and the erosion of trust
    between communities and law enforcement.

- The promise of a more orderly society is a false one, as it does not
  address the underlying structural issues that lead to crime and
  disorder.

CR Notes:

- Chapter 2

  - Broken Windows; James Q Wilson and George L. Kelling

    - "Disorder and crime are inextricably linked, in a kind of
      developmental sequence" (Wilson and Kelling 1982:31) (23)

      - Minor disorders like littering, loitering, public drinking,
        panhandling, and prostitution, if tolerated, create an
        environment that will attract crime

      - Criminals think no one is in charge and delinquent behavior
        won't be reported or controlled

    - Policy recommendation is "order-maintenance function" of policing
      that focuses on integrating police into the community and teaching
      them to maintain peace and order instead of solving crimes (24-25)

    - Insider-outsider dichotomy between orderly and disorderly people

<!-- -->

- Edward C Banfield and the Lower Class

  - The "logic of growth" refers to the idea that well-off people move
    to the suburbs because they can afford more space and to commute.
    Then, urban cities "fall into the hands of the less well-off," who
    are happy to move downtown in the city to be closer to shops and
    jobs and to escape poverty in rural neighborhoods

    - Requires that, "in general, the lowest-income people live in the
      oldest, highest-density, and most run-down housing, which will be
      nearest to the factories, warehouses, stores, and offices of the
      inner city, or downtown, part of the central city" (1974:52) (28)

  - Broken bottle theory suggests that the poor have a reason to let
    their neighborhood decay to avoid their neighborhoods coming too
    desirable and in turn being priced out

  - "Behavioral norms and the concept of class" account for crime-ridden
    areas

    - Class is defined as "patterns of perception, taste, attitude, and
      behavior" which permeate all aspects of someone's life (28)

    - A lower class person is more oriented to the present, whereas a
      well-off person is oriented to the future

      - Focus on the present gives rise to anti-social behavior and
        crime because crime is something done in the present, and
        punishment is in the future and therefore not as carefully
        considered

      - "'Amoral familism' is the tendency to care only about the
        short-term material advantages of one's nuclear family and to
        disregard all other, larger interests, such as the interest of
        one's community, city, or nation" (31)

  - Policy proposals

    - Repeal minimum wage

    - Reduce school-leaving age

    - Enact negative income tax for the "competent" poor

    - Provide intensive birth-control guidance for the "incompetent
      poor"

    - Incentivize victims to take precautions to prevent crime next time

    - Intensify patrols in high-crime neighborhoods

    - Permit stop and frisk

    - Reduce time between arrest and conviction

- James Q. Wilson and Human Nature

  - Political feasibility is the driving force behind policy orientation

  - "\...there is a human nature that develops in intimate settings out
    of a complex interaction of constitutional and social factors, and
    that this nature affects how people choose between the consequences
    of crime and its alternatives" (1985:508) (36)

  - Global crime patterns respond more to cultural circumstances than
    material circumstances, as they did previously

- The New Chicago School

  - Promotion of "milder public-order alternatives," which include
    "youth curfews, anti-gang loitering ordinances, and
    order-maintenances crackdowns (kahan and Meares 1999a:23)" (37-38)

  - Changing a neighborhood from disorder to order will reduce crime

  - Rewarding young people who snitch on their peers is one way to
    redefine the norm of social behavior

  - Police-church collaborative relationships change the community's
    relationship with police and changes police perception of the
    community

  - Policy proposals

    - Juvenile snitching

    - Anti-gang loitering ordinances

    - Order-maintenance policing

- The "Revolution in American Policing"

  - Blue revolution in American policing

    - Community policing - police officers can prevent crimes by
      integrating themselves into the community and solving community
      problems rather than responding only to emergency calls

      - Prevention-oriented

      - Shares the task of identifying problems, solving them, and
        controlling crime with the public

      - Difficulties

        - Police aggressively arresting low-level offenders

        - Police tolerate disorderly behavior to build rapport with the
          community

- Chapter 3

  - Looking to see if there is statistical connection between the level
    of "disorder" in a neighborhood and the amount of crime

  - Skogan's study does not prove a connection between disorder and
    serious crime, despite his conclusion that there may be a connection
    or even a causal relationship

**Jack Balkin: *Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought***

- Jack M. Balkin suggests that legal thought can be compared to a
  crystalline structure. The idea is to understand law as a dynamic
  system of rules, principles, and concepts that evolve and adapt over
  time. Just as a crystal can take on various forms while maintaining
  its underlying structure, legal thought can adapt to changing social
  and cultural contexts while retaining its fundamental principles.
  Legal doctrines and argument s share a common structure that are
  replicated throughout diverse areas of legal doctrine.

- Balkin\'s crystalline structure metaphor emphasizes the flexibility
  and adaptability of legal systems. It suggests that legal concepts can
  undergo transformation and reinterpretation without losing their
  coherence. This perspective allows for an understanding of how legal
  ideas interact with and respond to societal changes, technological
  advancements, and cultural shifts

- "Legal thought and legal argument have a crystalline structure. I mean
  by this not that legal doctrines have a self-replicating structure,
  but rather that legal arguments that people make in defense of legal
  doctrines share a common structure"

- The crystalline structure of legal arguments is important because

  - It makes it easy to teach to law students and easy for law students
    to grasp

  - It raises important questions about the law that people reason in
    their legal arguments

- "Our ability to recast legal doctrines into successive dyadic rule
  choices is important because it exposes the common structures of legal
  thought"

- Vast portions of legal doctrine recapitulate the dialectic between the
  pairs of opposed ideas: individualism and communalism

  - Individualist seeks to de-emphasize or minimize the responsibilities
    and duties of individuals to others in society (responsibility
    denying)

  - The communalist position seeks to emphasize and extend the
    responsibilities and duties individuals owe others (responsibility
    affirming)

  - The arguments for and against each rule will be similar because they
    are like a see-saw: in tension.

## Status Crimes

***Robinson v. California* (1962)**

- **Facts**: Robinson convicted under a CA statute that made it illegal
  to be addicted to drugs. Evidence included scars and needle marks on
  his arms.

- **Issue**:May a statute criminalize the status of being addicted to
  narcotics?

- **Holding**: A state statute that imprisons a defendant solely on
  account of the defendant's addiction to narcotics is in violation of
  the Eighth Amendment, in light of the contemporary human knowledge on
  addiction.

  - Also, there is no act -- no proof he did anything, no proof that he
    did anything in CA, no voluntary act (addiction), insufficient
    evidence of criminal activity

- **Takeaway**:

  - Criminalizing addiction alone violates 8th and 14th Amendment --
    criminal penalties may only be imposed if a defendant has engaged in
    some behavior that society has an interest in preventing

***Powell v. Texas* (1968)**

- **Facts**: Powell was arrested and charged with being drunk in a
  public place; expert testified that he knew the difference between
  right and wrong when sober and his first drink was voluntary, with the
  qualification that the voluntary exercise was influenced by
  "compulsion" of alcohol.

- **Issue**: Is the punishment of conduct that is symptomatic of chronic
  alcoholism in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments'
  proscription against cruel and unusual punishment?

- **Holding**: it does not violate cruel and unusual punishment since
  there are not enough facts to find alcoholism a disease and he did the
  **act** of drinking. Public toxication = voluntary.

  - *Robinson* is not controlling because appellant was not simply
    convicted for being an alcoholic; rather, he was engaging in public
    behavior that could lead to public health/safety issues

- Fortas dissent: this is exactly like *Robinson*; defendant was
  powerless to avoid drinking, and criminal penalties cannot be
  inflicted upon a person for being in a condition he is powerless to
  change.

***City of Grants Pass v. Johnson* (2024)**

- **Facts**: the city had three criminal laws that made it illegal to
  sleep or camp on city property, including in overnight parking. Past
  precedent in 9th Cir. held that if a person was involuntarily
  homeless, it was cruel and unusual to punish that person for camping
  on public property. There were not enough shelter beds in Grants Pass;
  biological requirement to sleep.

- **Issue**: Does criminalizing involuntary behavior violate the Eighth
  Amendment?

- **Holding**: No. Cruel punishments are ones that intentionally
  superadd terror, pain, or disgrace, and unusual ones are those that
  have fallen out of use. Generally, 8th Amendment only applies to
  punishments after a violation has occurred rather than the substance
  itself, except for status crimes. But *Robinson* is distinguishable;
  the Eighth Amendment has no impact on a state's authority to
  criminalize an individual's actions, even if those actions are an
  involuntary reaction to having a particular status, like an
  involuntary reaction to being an addict or being homeless.

- Dissent (Sotomayor): This case falls squarely under Robinson. The
  city's anti-camping laws criminalize sleeping in public areas. All
  people need to sleep, and a person without access to shelter has no
  choice but to sleep in a public area.

## 

## Common Law Murder

- Blackstone: murder is killing of a human being by another human being
  with malice aforethought

  - Aforethought is relevant when there's a distinction of premeditation
    or spur-of-the-moment.

  - Actus reus: unlawful killing. Mens rea: malice aforethought.

    - Harcourt: interestingly, most statutes have result of conduct,
      here it is the conduct that is read into the statute.

  - 5 things that are considered malice aforethought:

> 1\) premeditated: formed a plan ahead of time
>
> 2\) intent to cause death (purpose)
>
> 3\) intent to inflict serious bodily harm (Even if you don't intend
> death, if it happens it is murder under CL)
>
> 4\) extreme recklessness and indifference to life: depraved heart
>
> 5\) during the course of a felony: felony-murder

\[Intent to cause death is explicit malice, the other forms are implied
malice.\]

- How to refute murder charge:

> 1\) Justification (self-defense)
>
> 2\) Excuse (insanity, duress)
>
> 3\) Mitigating circumstances (adequate provocation)

- 1st degree: if both intentional and premeditated, or if it involves a
  killing during the course of another major felony (as defined by
  statute)

  - Generally, only 1st degree murder with an aggravating circumstance
    would have an option for death penalty

  - 2nd degree: anything not falling within 1st degree

Manslaughter = homicide without malice aforethought: three types

- Voluntary manslaughter

  - intentional killing that would otherwise be murder but committed in
    sudden head of passion as a result of adequate provocation without
    cooling off period.

- Involuntary manslaughter:

  - Criminal negligence: unintentional killing that results from an act
    lawful by itself but done in an unlawful/grossly negligence manner

  - Misdemeanor-manslaughter: unintentional killing resulting from
    commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony

    - But, if committed during a felony, then it is murder.

## 

## Intended Killings - Premeditation

MPC has gotten rid of premeditation sometimes those who are least
morally blameworthy/tortured by their decision are the most culpable of
premeditation whereas a cold-blooded killer could have little
premeditation but be highly morally blameworthy. But most jx do have
premeditation

***Commonwealth v. Carroll* (PA 1963) -** *Nothing is too short to
qualify as premeditation. Intent and premeditation are the same.
PREMEDITATION CAN BE FORMED IN THE MOMENT.*

- **Facts**: Carroll and his wife had a turbulent marriage and, one
  night, after a "violent and protected argument" lasting hours, C shot
  her after she fell asleep. Wife was schizophrenic and often abused the
  children. C claims the shooting was unintentional, he subconsciously
  used the gun as an "automatic reflex' while thinking of his kids. C is
  convicted to first-degree murder: "Willful, deliberate, & premeditated
  killing"

- **Issue**: Should a lack of specific premeditation support instead a
  charge of second-degree murder? \[Claim about sufficiency of the
  evidence -- substantive challenge to the evidence presented at
  trial.\]

- **Holding**: No. The specific intent to kill can be inferred from Δ's
  words, conduct, or from the attendant circumstances.

  - Here, aiming a gun at a head is intentional enough. Whether the
    intent to kill formed an instant or a long time beforehand is
    immaterial.

  - Courts cannot abdicate to psychiatrists the task of determining
    criminal responsibility in law nor can they remit to psychiatrists
    the right to determine the intent or state of mind of an accused at
    the time of the commission of a homicide.

  - Pennsylvania courts clarified: Whenever there is a conscious purpose
    to bring about death → Premeditation

  - Arizona statute: Defendant acts either with intention or knowledge
    that he will kill another human being + precedes the killing by any
    length of time to permit reflection → Premeditation

  - In many jurisdictions, intent to kill can be inferred from intent to
    shoot or pull the trigger. \[TIME FRAMING/CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES\]

  - Criticism: because this approach effectively equates premeditation
    with any intent to kill, it eliminates any distinction between first
    and second degree murder when killing is intention.

    - AZ SC therefore decided in *State v. Thomas* therefore concluded
      that AZ statute was arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional in
      violation of due process. To save its constitutionality, the court
      interpreted the statute to require proof of actual reflection,
      contrary to its language.

    - But the *Carroll* approach preserves some distinction in that some
      kind of unintentional killing could demonstrate malice and thus
      count as second, but not first degree murder.

    - Policy criticism: Effectively eliminates any distinction between
      1st and 2nd degree murder which goes against the legislature's
      rationale for creating degrees of murder.

***State v. Guthrie* (W.V. 1995)*:*** *Premeditation would have required
time for reflection before stabbing a coworker. Two separate events:
Intent, and then further action. Premeditation must not be equated with
intent to kill.*

- **Facts**: Guthrie and his coworker got along well. Poking fun, Farley
  snapped a dish towel at the defendant, clipping his nose. Enraged,
  Guthrie pulled a knife and stabbed the victim in the neck. Gurthrie
  suffered mental issues, including a fixation on his nose and panic
  attacks, one of which occurred that night. Charge: first degree
  murder; "willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing."

- **Issue**: Guthrie was convicted. Instructions said: Premeditation
  means intent to kill even "only for an instant." Were jury
  instructions wrong to equate premeditation to intent?

- **Holding**: Yes. Failed to adequately inform jury of difference
  between first- and second-degree murder.

  - Though premeditation and deliberation are not measured by any
    particular period of time, there must be some period between
    formation of the intent to kill and the actual killing; there must
    be evidence indicating that the defendant weighed and considered
    their decision to kill.

  - Indicates an opportunity for reflection on the intention to kill
    after it is formed. Accused must kill purposely after contemplating
    the intent to kill.

    - First degree: Deliberate killer

    - Second degree: Impulsive killer (spontaneous; nonreflective)

***Anderson* elements: (1) Planning, (2) Motive, and (3) Manner**

In jurisdiction where premeditation must have actual reflection
(Guthrie, not Carrol), you need evidence of premeditation.

\*Anderson court noted it typically sustains first-degree verdicts when
evidence of all three elements, and otherwise requires at least:

- Extremely strong evidence of (1), OR

- Evidence of (2) in conjunction with either (1) or (3).

**PLANNING:** Facts regarding ∆ behavior prior to killing that might
indicate a design to take life.

- *Carroll*: Prosecution will argue that the gun was on the windowsill.
  Defense will argue that the gun was there to protect the wife.

- *Guthrie*: Prosecution will argue that he had a big knife in his
  pocket (wide, reflecting). Defense will argue that it was a common
  thing for him to carry and not evidence of planning.

**MOTIVE:** Facts regarding ∆ prior relationship with V that might
indicate a reason to kill.

- *Carroll*: Prosecution will argue that he had a terrible marriage,
  foreseeing future issues with kids, maybe even custody battle.
  Defense: not great.

- *Guthrie*: Prosecution has no great evidence; need to go for a strong
  argument for (1). Defense: no motive, these were his friends. Just
  snapped; in some sort of psychosis.

**MANNER:** Evidence that the manner of killing was so particular and
exacting that ∆ must have intentionally killed according to a
preconceived design.

- *Carroll*: Prosecution will argue that he cleaned up the body pretty
  professionally. Defense will argue that it doesn't seem planned
  because he was lost and scrambling after the action.

- *Guthrie*: Prosecution will say that he stabbed the victim pretty
  immediately upon taunt; aimed for the jugular. Defense will say he
  happened to hit his neck and was just stabbing haphazardly.

<!-- -->

- MPC has abandoned premeditation, following that lead, some states have
  rejected premeditation as the basis for ID'ing murders that deserve
  the greatest punishment.

## 

## Intended Killings - Heat of Passion

Way to mitigate from intentional killing from murder → manslaughter when
there was a "provocation" that caused the defendant to act in the heat
of passion.

- The killing is intentional. The question is whether it should be
  murder or voluntary manslaughter.

Policy rationales for mitigation:

- Under passion, conduct is less reflective and, therefore, less
  blameworthy (retribution)

- Provocation reduces the moral blameworthiness of killing because
  defendants think they have good reason to kill

- From a utilitarian perspective, the law seeks to find an optimal level
  of deterrence, and those who kill upon provocation are likely not as
  dangerous as those who kill without.

Three approaches:

***Girourard** --* objective, categorical (common law approach --
extreme assault or battery upon defendant, mutual combat, defendant's
illegal arrest, injury or serious abuse of close relative of the
defendant, or the sudden discovery of a spouse's adultery; gay panic
defense). Words alone generally cannot provoke, but some courts hold
they can if they disclose facts that would be sufficient if the
defendant observed them directly.

***Maher*** -- jury question (minority view -- provoking circumstances
need not conform to any pre-established categories and that it is
normally a question for the jury to decide whether the facts as a whole
demonstrate sufficient provocation)

***Cassassa*** -- EED (MPC approach, which some states have adopted
fully, others with revision. See MPC 210.3(1)(b). Replaces the common
law heat of passion doctrine; arguably broader because it does not
require the reaction to be immediate. Decidedly ambiguous; vague,
flexible standard that leaves discretion to the jury. Allows cultural
norms and values to have free reign in the jury box)

Provocation claims for mitigation are rarely successful.

Cooling time: the common law view is that a significant lapse of time
between the provocation and the act of killing renders the provocation
inadequate as a matter of law and therefore deprives the dependant of
the right to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter"

***Girouard v. State*:** Provocation must be calculated to inflame the
passion of a reasonable man and to cause him to act for the moment from
passion rather than reason. (Need more than words). \[**Majority
approach\]**

- **Facts**: Girouard (Δ) and his wife (V) had a strained marriage.
  During a fight, V insulted him, threatened divorce, and added she
  filed charges with the JAG. Δ stabbed her 19 times. When the gravity
  set in, he tried to die before calling the police. Δ convicted of
  2nd-degree murder.

- **Issue**: Are words without more sufficient provocation to reduce to
  murder to manslaughter?

- **Holding:** No. Δ incorrectly argues manslaughter is a catchall for
  homicides w/o malice & that words alone provoked him to attack w/o
  malice. The provocation was not enough to mitigate second degree
  murder to voluntary manslaughter

  - Prevailing view that words can't suffice has been softened in many
    jurisdictions to allow an exception when the words provoke, not
    simply because they are insulting, but because they disclose facts
    that could be sufficient if the defendant had observed them

  - "Words alone cannot constitute adequate provocation. Words are
    regarded as sufficient provocation if they are both 1) calculated to
    inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act
    for the moment from passion rather than reason, and 2) accompanied
    by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the
    defendant bodily harm."

  - D couldn't have feared for bodily harm because his wife was much
    smaller than him → bias built in.

- **Policy: "**Social necessity dictates our holding. Domestic arguments
  easily escalate into furious fights. We perceive no reason for a
  holding in favor of those who find the easiest way to end a domestic
  dispute is by killing the offending spouse."

- Notes:

  - Defendant says he lacked mens rea; rather he was provoked in the
    heat of the moment with mental disturbance. Asking for the court to
    include new category

  - State argument: mens rea, malice is present.

  - Two options: extreme objective standard (ask whether an objective
    reasonable person would have been enraged to the point of murder in
    the same circumstances) vs. subjective standard: was this specific
    defendant subjectively in the heat of passion/out of his mind --
    case by case. In this case, they use an objective standard, finding
    that provocation by words is not sufficient to justify
    heat-of-the-moment killing -- it was murder not manslaughter. No new
    category.

***Maher v. People* (Mich. 1862):** *More flexible; more subjective; for
the jury to decide: No court can "catalogue all the various facts and
combinations of facts which shall be held \[sufficient provocation for
mitigation to manslaughter or cooling time\]."* **\[Minority
Approach\]**

- **Facts**: Maher (Δ) followed his wife and Hunt (V) as they entered
  the woods together and, then, followed V to the saloon. On the way, a
  friend stopped Δ and told him that V and Δ's wife had intercourse in
  the woods the previous day. Δ entered the bar and attempted to kill V.
  Charged with assault with intent to murder. He was convicted; TC ruled
  the evidence of adultery inadmissible.

- **Issue:** Would the proposed evidence have reduced murder to
  manslaughter?

- **Holding:** The proposed evidence was improperly excluded. Common law
  murder requires the offender's judgement not be clouded by passion.
  Jurors are better apt to weigh the facts than fixed categories or,
  except in the most extreme cases, the judge's own determination. In a
  Maher jurisdiction, you don't need fear of bodily harm. Provocation is
  a jury question.

  - Provoking circumstances need not conform to any pre-established
    categories and that it is normally a question for the jury to decide
    whether the facts as a whole demonstrate sufficient provocation

  - For murder to be reduced to manslaughter, "reason should, at the
    time of the act, be disturbed or obscured by passion to an extent
    which might render ordinary men, of fair average disposition, liable
    to act rashly or without due deliberation or reflection, and from
    passion, rather than judgment."

  - The killing must be committed under the influence of passion
    produced by an adequate or reasonable provocation (i.e., one that
    would produce such a state of mind in ordinary men) and before a
    reasonable time has elapsed for the blood to cool.

  - Per Harcourt, this is an arcane understanding of provocation
    motivated by patriarchal conceptions of a man's "right" to his
    woman. Look at the year this case was decided.

***People v. Casassa* (N.Y. 1980)** *MPC EED mitigation to manslaughter
has both subjective and objective elements. EED expands upon common law
'heat of passion' by removing cooling and provocation.*

- **Facts:** Casassa (Δ) and Lo Consolo (V) dated until V said she was
  not falling in love. A "devastated" Δ fell into emotional distress,
  broke into V's apt, undressed and lay in V's bed with a knife. Δ
  returned when V was home with gifts. V rejected the advance and Δ
  killed her.

- **Statute**: Second-degree murder charge, Δ raised an affirmative
  defense of EED. It is an affirmative defense to second-degree murder
  if "the Δ acted under the influence of an extreme emotional
  disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse."

- **Issue:** Should a subjective EED standard be applied?

- **Holding:** No. EED expands upon heat of passion by removing cooling
  and non-reflection. Under the MPC, which NY based its EED defense, (1)
  the particular Δ must have acted under EED and (2) there was a
  reasonable explanation or excuse. The first is clearly subjective, but
  the second is meant to be an objective reasonable review of the first.

  - Defendant's (E)ED does not have a reasonable explanation/excuse.

    - Subjective: Yes, the defendant was clearly emotionally distressed.

    - Objective(ish): His emotional distress was not reasonably
      justified from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's
      circumstances.

  - Note: MPC §210.3 states that a murder is downgraded to manslaughter
    when it was "committed under the influence of extreme mental or
    emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or
    excuse." (NYPL based on this)

  - The MPC is decidedly ambiguous.

## Felony Murder

- At common law, it refers to causing death in the course of
  perpetrating another felony. Strict liability offense in the sense
  that it doesn't require a distinct mens rea to kill; rather, the
  intent to commit felony accounts for the mens rea that resulted in the
  death of the victim.

  - "Furtherance of another felony" requirement is no so clear when:

    - The lethal act arguably occurs after the commission of a felony;

    - The lethal act is arguably unrelated to the felony;

    - The lethal act is committed by someone resisting the felony
      (*Canola*) -- i.e., can felons be responsible for deaths resulting
      from the actions of cops and private citizens who try to thwart
      the attempted crime?

- MPC 201.2: Has no standalone felony-murder provision. Doesn't make
  felony-murder a strict liability offense but creates a **presumption
  of recklessness** (a conscious appreciation and disregard as to risk
  of death) when a homicide occurs during the commission of certain
  felonies. MPC doesn't like the felony-murder rule, but most states
  nonetheless retain some form of the rule

  - "committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme
    indifference to the value of human life. Such reck-lessness and
    indifference are presumed if the actor is engaged or is an
    accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight
    after committing or attempting to commit robbery, rape or deviate
    sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary,
    kidnapping or felonious escape."

  - NB: presumption is rebuttable: if Δ has sufficient evidence to raise
    an issue, prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt. Contrast
    to common law.

- Felony murder is an example of how the norms of our culture infuse the
  criminal law. It comes in part from class (See, Edward Coke on the
  significance of whether a hunter who shoots someone is on his property
  or not). Felony murder operates as a way to **entrench social order**,
  including systemic racism, into the law

  - Maybe that's why society was ready to take Adnan Khan, a homeless
    drop-out, and put him in prison for the rest of his life. [Once you
    have acted criminally, you are a delinquent; once you undertake some
    criminal behavior, any circumstances that follow are your
    responsibility. A way to attach more liability, mostly for people of
    color. Paradox in that you don't really intend death, they still
    presume extreme recklessness.]{.mark}

***Regina v. Serne* (UK 1887)** *minority rule: intent to commit a
felony that is known to create a danger to human life*

- **Facts**: Leon Serné and his family were in severe debt, living in
  house above a store in London. Serné had taken out a life insurance
  policy on his son Sjaak. Within a month the store and house burned
  down, and both his sons died. At trial, prosecution introduced
  evidence that Serné and Goldfinch had been seen together in the shop
  shortly before the fire started. It was alleged they willfully set
  fire and were indicted for Sjaak's murder.

- **Issue**: If a person commits a felonious act known to be dangerous
  to life and likely to cause death to another person, and death
  results, is it murder?

- **Holding**: Yes, but narrower holding of felony-murder: Only an
  action taken w/ intent to commit a felony that is known to create a
  danger to human life, likely in itself to cause death, can constitute
  felony-murder, not just killing of another person by an act done with
  intent.

  - Reflects view generally accepted in American courts.

- Notes:

  - Footnote to Serne quotes Edward Coke, Institute 46: If a man
    accidentally shoots another hunting and trespassing on another's
    land, that constitutes felony murder. However, if a man accidentally
    shoots another while hunting on his own land, that is considered an
    accidental killing.

    - Shows class/property dimension: What renders the same act
      punishable is the fact that you're not the property owner.

    - Felony murder in part comes from class and is woven into the law

    - Harcourt's thoughts: Felony murder operates as a way to entrench
      social order-- including systemic racism-- into the law. That's
      why doctrines like felony murder rule allow for punishment to be
      so disproportionate from moral culpability

***King v. Commonwealth* (VA 1988)** *Foreseeability required.*

- **Facts**: King (Δ) and copilot (V) were flying marijuana in a light
  plane and crashed when they got lost in a fog. V died in the crash. Δ
  charged and convicted of felony murder.

- **Issue**: For the felony-murder rule to apply, must the death of a
  victim be directly related in time, place, and causal connection to
  the commission of a felony?

- **Holding**: Although the "but-for" element of felony murder actus
  reus was met, the foreseeability element was not---the crash was not a
  foreseeable result of the felony because the crash was not made more
  likely by the fact that the plane's cargo was contraband. Caused by
  flying too low. If they were flying low to avoid detection, this might
  be different.

***People v. Stamp* (CA 1969)** *Eggshell victim. So long as life is
shortened as a result of the felonious act, it does not matter that the
victim might have died soon anyway. In this respect, the robber takes
his victim as he finds him.*

- **Facts:** Defendant burglarized Honeyman's store, robbed him at
  gunpoint. After, Honeyman (60-year-old w/ history of heart disease)
  died of a heart attack. Doctors testified that the fright from the
  robbery was too much of a shock to Honeyman's system.

- **Issue:** Is a defendant responsible for unforeseeable deaths?

- **Holding:** Felony-murder doctrine not limited to foreseeable deaths;
  a felon is instead held strictly liable for all killings committed by
  him/his accomplices in the course of the felony. As long as the
  homicide is the direct causal result of the robbery the felony-murder
  rule applies whether or not the death was a natural/probable
  consequence of the robbery. The robber takes his victim as he finds
  him.

***State v. Canola* (NJ 1977)** *Endorsement of agency theory.*

- **Facts**: Jewelry store owner resisted an attempted armed robbery by
  defendant (Canola) and his accomplices. One accomplice and the store
  owner exchanged gunfire, both died. Defendant and two accomplices
  indicted on one count of robbery and two counts of murder (store owner
  and co-felon). Defendant found guilty on both murder counts and
  sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment.

- **Issue:** Under NJ law, can a defendant be found guilty of
  felony-murder when during his robbery of a store one of the robbery
  victims shoots one of the defendant's accomplices?

- **Holding:** No. Court endorses agency theory of felony murder and
  rejects proximate cause theory. Some felonies are not as blameworthy
  as premeditated killings. Concepts of foreseeability and proximate
  cause have shallow relevance to culpability for murder in the 1st
  degree. Proximate cause theory should not apply because gradations of
  criminal liability should accord with the degree of moral culpability
  for the actor's conduct

- **Note on AGENCY VERSUS PROXIMATE THEORIES**: Under agency theory, the
  identity of the actual killer is a central issue: only if the act of
  killing is done by a co-felon or someone acting in concert with a
  co-felon does felony murder apply.

  - Agency theory's policy: retribution; based on ID of the killer so
    more closely tied to moral culpability; non-felons are justified in
    any acts of violence they do (self-defense) so no moral culpability
    to transfer to D.

    - Punishing people based on who they are, rather than what they do?
      Probably not, because it also punishes based on what people do

  - Proximate cause theory's policy: Liability attaches for any death
    proximately resulting from the unlawful activity, though it is most
    often applied in those states that follow the enumerated felonies
    that are inherently dangerous to life approach to felony murder.
    I.e., foreseeable that death could result from felonies that involve
    weapon. Focused on foreseeability.

    - More expansive liability, likely to include everything. BUT also
      affirmative defense for felons who can show they had no reason to
      anticipate use of deadly force.

    - POLICY

    - Was death a foreseeable consequence of committing the felony?

      - Retribution: we want to punish people for all acts that they
        reasonably foresee could occur from their criminal behavior

      - Utilitarian: low deterrence value in punishing people for all
        reasonably foreseeable acts b/c unlikely that D actually
        considers "reasonably foreseeable" consequences, which is very
        broad

New York's rule: proximate cause theory. **NYPL 125.25**: Person is
guilty of murder if, "in the course of and in furtherance of
\[designated felonies\], [he, or another participant]{.mark}...causes
the death of a person [other than one of the participants]{.mark}."

***Adnan Khan case --* "Sentenced to Life for an Accident Miles Away"**

- Two men were stealing out of unlocked cars. One escaped and the other
  was in police custody. The escaped man ran a red light and got into a
  car accident, killing two bikers. Both men were charged with
  felony-murder, despite one already being in police custody at the time
  of the accident. Both men were found guilty

- "We shouldn't underestimate how many plea bargains occur in the shadow
  of felony-murder charges across the country," Ekow Yankah, a law
  professor at the University of Michigan, told me. "It is one of those
  quiet drivers of mass incarceration we never acknowledge."

- Racial disparities for felony-murder convictions are
  higher---sometimes far higher---than the already disproportionate
  rates of Black incarceration overall

- Could former President Trump be prosecuted for felony murder for
  urging on the Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which led to a number of
  deaths? Could fossil-fuel-company executives be held liable for murder
  for criminally deceiving the public about carbon emissions that killed
  people? If we take the felony-murder doctrine's core premise
  seriously, it's easy to imagine a radically different justice system.
  But the doctrine is rarely levelled against people of influence. It is
  used instead to impose some of our society's harshest punishments on
  low-income defendants, young people, and defendants of color.

- Cicero's Notes:

  - Planned to simply grab some marijuana and run, without the use of
    weapons. But getaway driver (who was schizophrenic) murdered the
    robbery victim.

  - By the time of 17, parentless, homeless, high school dropout:
    abandoned, abused, traumatized

  - Because he had participated in robbery in which someone was killed,
    he was guilty of murder (even though he had no intent to kill) and
    was sentenced to 25 years to life

  - Was unaware of felony murder rule till charged w/ it

  - \[Maybe society wanted to get rid of what it saw as a no-goodnik?\]

  - Two defenses Khan could have raised:

    - No logical nexus: No connection between robbery & murder, since
      killer killed because of his psychotic mental state, not the
      robbery itself

    - No causation: The psychotic killer was an intervening cause

  - At San Quentin, founded Re:Store Justice, fundraised from prison,
    hired staff, and pushed for Senate bill. Shaped public opinion,
    which was essential for reform.

  - CA SB 1437 changed the felony murder rule so it would only apply to
    co-defendants who shared the intent to kill. After this law passed,
    Khan released based on time served.

## Unintended Killings - Extreme Recklessness (Murder)

Under the MPC, unintended killings can be negligent homicide,
manslaughter, or murder.

Negligent homicide versus manslaughter

- Distinguished by whether the defendant was aware of the unwarranted
  risk he was creating.

  - Negligent homicide: a person should have been aware of such risk.

  - Manslaughter: "conscious disregard"

**Manslaughter** (**MPC §210.3**) **v. reckless murder** (**MPC
§210.2(1)(b)**)

- Ordinary recklessness (**MPC §2.02(2)(c)**) is enough for manslaughter
  under **MPC §210.3(1)(a).**

  - Yet murder also requires that the actor's conscious disregard of the
    risk, under the circumstances must manifest **extreme indifference**
    to the value of human life...."

  - "Whether recklessness is so extreme that it demonstrates \[such\]
    indifference... must be **left directly to the trier of fact**."
    (512)

***Commonwealth v. Malone* (PA 1946)** *Wanton disregard for
consequences can qualify as malice for common law **murder**, even if
killing unintentional. "Evil design in general."* See MPC §210.2(1)(b)

- **Facts:** A 17-year-old killed his 13-year-old friend while playing
  Russian Roulette. Δ testified he had loaded the gun in a way to
  prevent firing and never intended to harm V, his friend. In his
  belief, the way he loaded it, the gun wouldn't have fired until the
  5th shot. It may explain why he took five shots in a row. He must have
  not actually put the bullet in the first chamber. Δ was convicted of
  2nd-deg murder.

- **Rule:** When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for
  which he must reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to
  result, he exhibits that "wickedness of disposition, hardness of
  heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of
  social duty" which proves that malice was present

- **Issue:** Do the facts justify a conviction for murder over
  manslaughter?

- **Holding:** Yes, charge of murder is correct. Malice is evidenced by
  the defendant's "doing of an uncalled for act in callous disregard of
  its likely harmful effects on others"

  - When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which he
    must anticipate that death to another is likely the result, he
    exhibits that wickedness of disposition... which proves there was
    malice.

  - Lack of motive is not dispositive

- **Notes**

  - Accused does not intend to kill her victim, but **malice** is
    implied because the defendant's conduct demonstrates **extreme
    recklessness** or indifference to human life.

  - *Malice* is a reflection of common law formulations of the
    circumstances under which an unintentional killing constitutes
    murder rather than manslaughter (e.g., "wicked, depraved, and
    malignant heart")

  - "The common law and statutes derived from it distinguished between
    manslaughter and unintentional murder based on *how wicked and
    depraved* the killing seemed to be. That approach, of course, remits
    the issue to **subjective judgments calls** of the judge or jury."
    (512)

## Unintended Killings - Reckless Manslaughter and Negligent Homicide

***Commonwealth v. Welansky* (1942)** *Where there is a duty of care, an
intentional omission may count as wantonness or recklessness if an
ordinary man under the same circumstances would have realized danger.*

- **Facts**: Welansky (Δ), owner of a Boston night club, was charged
  with involuntary manslaughter for the death of hundreds of patrons at
  his club as a result of a fire. As owner of club, Δ had a legal duty
  to his invitees to use reasonable care in keeping the premises safe
  for their use and preventing both known and unknown dangers. The club
  was over legal capacity; emergency exits were blocked; the owner was i
  the hospital at the time and was not present on the night in question.

- **Statute**: Involuntary manslaughter through wanton or **reckless**
  conduct.

- **Issue**: Was defendant's omission reckless or wanton?

- **Holding**: Yes. Where there is a duty of care, as here, **an
  intentional omission may count as wanton or reckless. His intentional
  omission was reckless because:**

  - He was aware that his venue was not in compliance with local safety
    regulations

  - He knew that construction plans for new part of lounge precluded the
    possibility of installing the doors necessary to comply w/ safety
    regulations.

  - Massachusetts common law has NO criminal negligence (no purely
    reasonable person crime)

  - "The essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct,
    by way either of commission or of omission where there is a duty to
    act, which conduct involves a high degree of likelihood that
    substantial harm will result to another. Wanton or reckless conduct
    amounts to what has been variously described as indifference to or
    disregard of probable consequences to that other."" (Welansky)"

***People v. Hall* (CO 1990)** *A risk of death that has less than 50%
chance of occurring can still be "substantial." Actor's experience goes
to their mens rea.*

- **Facts**: While skiing, Hall (Δ) fatally collided with Cobb (V) who
  was on the slope below. Hall was an experienced skier.

- **Issue:** What is a substantial and unjustifiable risk?

- **Statute:** Reckless manslaughter requires that a person "recklessly
  cause the death of another person." Conduct is reckless when the actor
  consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death
  may result. (MPC §2.02)

- **Holding:** A risk of death that has less than a 50% chance of
  occurring can still be substantial. Here, the defendant created
  substantial risk (skiing at excessive speed with lack of control) and
  unjustified risk. "Enjoyment of skiing does not justify skiing at the
  speeds and with the lack of control Hall exhibited." Extreme violation
  of civil liability duty for skiers to avoid collisions and defendant
  disregarded risk ("Hall\'s knowledge and training could give rise to
  the reasonable inference that he was aware of the possibility that by
  skiing so fast and out of control he might collide with and kill
  another skier unless he regained control and slowed down.") Gross
  deviation of standard of care takes it from civil liability to
  criminal liability. A substantial risk is one that a reasonably
  prudent person would identify.

***State v. Williams* (WA 1971)** *A failure to "exercise the kind of
caution that a man of reasonable prudence would exercise under the same
or similar conditions," regardless of intentions or subjective
understanding, is enough to be criminally negligent homicide.*

- **Facts**: mother and stepfather of baby were convicted of
  manslaughter for negligently failing to take their baby to a doctor
  when he had an abscessed tooth that became infected and developed
  gangrene

- **Statute**: In Washington, involuntary manslaughter is committed if
  the death of the victim is the proximate result of simple negligence.
  Court applies the reasonable person standard to negligence.

- Holding: This was simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient
  to support a conviction of negligent manslaughter.

  - If a person commits ordinary negligence, i.e. fails to exercise
    ordinary caution that a reasonable person would exercise under the
    same or similar circumstances, and such negligence proximately
    causes the death of another, a person is guilty of involuntary
    manslaughter.

- Notes:

  - The statute was later changed to require criminal negligence

  - Walter & Bernice Williams were Native American, respectively had 6th
    and 11th grade educations & feared state intervention/taking of
    children.

## Causation

"An individual is criminally liable if his conduct was a sufficiently
direct cause of the death, and the ultimate harm is something which
should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to his acts."
*Arzon*

- Factual cause is not required where two independent sufficient causes
  occur at once (for example two people with intent to kill each shoot
  one person in the head at the same time. Both are considered cause in
  fact)

- Even with both but-for and proximate cause, a defendant may be
  relieved of criminal liability by an intervening cause.

***People v. Acosta* (CA 1991)** *Foreseeable that the cop chasing you
will be negligent. Basically anything is foreseeable*

- **Facts**: Acosta (Δ) led police on a 48-mile car chase wherein ∆
  engaged in reckless driving. Two police helicopters monitoring the
  chase collided, killing all three police officers inside (V). Expert
  witness testifies helicopter maneuver was "not a difficult one, and
  was not affected by the ground activity at the time." Helicopter pilot
  who directly caused collision was not following FAA regulations, was
  being reckless -- intervening cause. D charged with three counts of
  second-degree murder.

- **Issue**: Were the three deaths proximately caused by Δ? \[Yes.\]

- **Holding**: Acosta's behavior was a proximate cause of the helicopter
  crash; the but-for requirement is met, and court focuses on
  foreseeability, stating that, "given the emotional dynamics of any
  police pursuit, there is an appreciable probability that a pursuer, in
  the heat of the chase, may act negligently to catch the quarry." This
  was not a "highly extraordinary" result of Acosta's behavior. "Given
  the dynamics of a police chase, there is an appreciable probability
  that one of the pursuers may act negligently or recklessly to catch
  the quarry."

***People v. Arzon* (NY 1978)** *Foreseeable that firemen would respond
to intentionally-set fire, so causation for firefighter's death
satisfied despite separate, contributing fire. ∆ fire an "indispensable"
link in the chain of events that resulted in the death.*

- **Facts:** Arzon (Δ) set fire to a couch on the fifth floor of an
  abandoned building which was inhabited by squatters. Firefighters
  responded to fight Arzon's fire. Meanwhile, another fire started
  independently on the 2nd floor and trapped the firefighters. The
  combination of the thick smoke and the two fires made evacuation
  hazardous, and a firefighter (V), sustained injuries from which he
  died. ∆ charged with arson, felony murder, second degree murder

- **Issue:** Is causation met?

- **Holding:** Causation is met because ∆'s fire caused the firefighters
  to come to the site. The defendant\'s conduct need not be the sole and
  exclusive factor in the victim\'s death. An individual is criminally
  liable. If his conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the death,
  and the ultimate harm is something which should have been foreseen as
  being reasonably related to his acts. It is relevant that, in this
  instance, the fire, which had erupted on the second floor, intervened,
  and thus contributing to the conditions that culminated in the death
  of the fireman.

# THEORIES OF PUNISHMENT

**[RETRIBUTION:]{.underline}** Backward Looking

**Positive Retributivism:** A just society must punish equally to
blameworthiness.

**Negative Retributivism:** Seriousness of offense sets an upper limit
on permissible punishment but does not mandate that extent. A state may
opt to punish less than that.

*Generally,* we punish people because they deserve it. Often understood
as a limiting principle on punishment, liked to offender's moral
culpability (sometimes associated with retaliation, the idea that
deseret is linked to the harm caused by an offense)

Since retribution is about the moral blameworthiness of an actor, it is
inherently more subjective than utilitarianism and allows for broader
time frames to be considered.

**SUPPORTERS**

- Kant: Jus talionis (eye for an eye) \[LIMITING PRINCIPLE\]

  - Crimes are wrongs because they violate categorical imperatives
    (penal law); punishment is justified by the criminal\'s having
    committed a crime

    - (i.e., **defendant is blameworthy & thus deserves punishment**)

  - **Rejects utilitarianism**

    - Utilitarianism treats criminals as a mere means to other's good
      (contrary to Categorical Imperative)

    - Utilitarianism "could, possibly, justify punishing an innocent
      person because of the good it might bring to society. To Kant,
      this sort of injustice is absolutely intolerable."

  - **Lex talionis** (i.e., an eye for an eye)

    - Kant "asserts that the hurt done to the criminal should **equal**
      the hurt the criminal did to others, both in amount and in kind"

  - **Death penalty *necessary*** (extreme position): "**Whoever has
    committed murder, must** **die**. There is, in this case, **no
    juridical substitute**..."

    - But doesn't this clash w/ gradations of homicide?

    - No conception of mercy---no possibility of just mercy, only just
      punishment.

  - Kant represents the classic view of retribution: crime & punishment
    are incredibly linked: punishment is simply for committing a crime

    - The two things on the scales are the crime and the punishment

    - Crimes are universal, not culturally determined, because of the
      categorical imperative. So blameworthiness & proportionality are
      almost etched in universals. Kant is not allowing for cultural
      variations we see in penal law

- Moore:

  - Retribution is the view that punishment is justified by the moral
    culpability of those who receive it. Duty to urge punishment on all
    offenders, even if the victims themselves do not want punishment,
    because offenders acted wrongly.

  - Must meet pareto efficiency in that no person is worse off /
    sacrificed in an attempt to punish others

  - Moral desert of an offender is a sufficient reason, but
    retributivism does not require any particular *kind or degree of
    punishment.*

- Morris: Those who break the law violate the social contract, so it is
  just to punish them

  - Without punishment, criminals would have an unfair advantage.

  - Punishment brings individuals back to par with law-abiding society

  - Hampton: A basic difficulty with the fair play theory is that it
    assumes that we censure and punish because wrongdoers are free
    riders. This assumption only makes sense if we believe that
    constraining ourselves, that we do not rape or murder or steal
    imposes a cost on us.

  - Murphy holds that, if we are morally sensitive enough to assert the
    moral right to punish, then we must ensure that criminals are
    genuinely acting autonomously and intentionally, and are benefitting
    from their crimes... in other words, the way society is structured
    now, that is not necessarily the case

**[UTILITARIANISM: FORWARD LOOKING]{.underline}**

Theories to maximize social welfare - based on consequences

We should maximize social utility via: (1) deterrence
(GENERAL/SPECIFIC), (2) incapacitation (THIS INDIVIDUAL), and (3)
rehabilitation (requires accepting that punishment alters/can alter the
defendant\'s behavior.)

**SUPPORTERS**

Bentham: Minimize pain and maximize pleasure

- All punishment is evil \[LIMITING PRINCIPLE\]. So, should only punish
  when doing so increases general welfare.

- Rational view of people's behavior: If the perceived punishment
  outweighs the perceived pleasure of an act, the potential actor will
  not carry it out.

- Moral notion of blameworthiness is not relevant to utilitarianism

- Rule utilitarianism type of action is morally right depending on the
  correctness of the rule that allows it to exist

**[REJECTORS]{.underline}**

- Kant says you cannot treat people as means, but rather as an end in
  themselves, otherwise you could punish someone for a crime they did
  not commit just because doing so has deterrent effects

- Often criticized for paying insufficient attention to individual
  rights and the perceived need for connection between punishment and
  offender's actual blame

**[Theories within Utilitarianism...]{.underline}**

CR Notes:

- Deterrence

  - Harsher punishments do not always lead to deterrence. Some
    explanations are

    - Crimes are largely committed by impulsive people. Punishment is
      delayed, so it does not deter impulse

    - Punishment doesn't deter if the actor does not know that what they
      are doing is punishable, does not perceive the threat of
      punishment to be greater than the benefit, and/or does not lean on
      this knowledge in the moment of committing a crime

    - Even in white collar crimes (insider trading, tax evasion, etc.)
      are not necessarily deterred by punishment

      - Income effect - severe punishments may raise the cost for people
        and compel them to commit more crimes to accomplish the same act

      - Attempts to increase punishment actually compel cooperation,
        which reduces sentences

  - Two ways to increase the deterrent effect of punishment

    - Increase risk of conviction

    - Increase severity of punishment

  - Criminal law can serve as a moral compass, and people may be
    deterred from committing crimes if they think they will appear
    immoral and be ostracized/lose moral credibility as a result

- Rehabilitation

  - Michael Vitiello, Reconsidering Rehabilitation

    - Quakers believed crime was the product of a society and that
      offenders could be rehabilitated through rationality. They created
      penitentiaries that employed solitary confinement, religious
      instruction, and hard labor

    - Rehabilitation rests on the idea that society will be better off
      for rehabilitating the offender or the paternalistic idea that
      rehabilitating offenders will allow them to flourish

  - Rehabilitation became increasing "medical" with undercurrents of
    science and psychiatry

    - Criticized for being discretionary and biased

    - Criticized for being too expensive and lenient

    - Fell out of favor in the late 1970s

  - Some argue that incarceration is intended to incapacitate, and
    everything else is second to this goal

- Retribution

  - Past looking (ex post)

  - Kant - punishment/using people cannot be a means to an end of
    promoting social good

    - Categorical imperative - universalize the maxim. If A does X,
      everyone needs to be able to do X in the same situation

  - Punishment must be justified by the seriousness of the offense, not
    by the future benefits to be obtained by punishing

    - Positive retributivism - society must punish the blameworthy

      - Kantian view

      - Empirical desert approach uses questionnaires to ascertain
        community views about deserved punishment in typical cases

    - Negative retributivism - moral guilt is a necessary but not
      sufficient condition of punishment. One cannot get more than they
      deserve, but the state can opt to lower the punishment

- Utilitarianism

  - Includes deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitations

  - Forward looking (ex ante)

  - Bentham

  - Maximizing social welfare

  - Punishment is only used when it is necessary

    - Punishment creates disutility for society

  - Deterrence theory

    - Specific vs. general deterrence (punishing individual to deter
      that person vs. punishing one person to deter general population)

    - Punishment must exceed benefit

    - Punishment = benefit \* sentence

    - Marginal deterrence (Marginal deterrence is a concept in law and
      economics that refers to the idea that penalties for crimes should
      increase with the severity of the crime to discourage offenders
      from committing more serious offenses.)

    - Speed of punishing and discounting

    - Locating right level of deterrence - welfare calculus

  - Rehabilitation theory

    - Moral transformation

    - Robert Martinson 1974 paper - concludes that nothing works to
      rehabilitate criminals or reduce recidivism

      - Only option is incapacitation

  - Incapacitation theory

    - Selective vs. mass (incapacitate the worst of the worst vs.
      incapacitate all criminals)

***State v. Clarissa* (AL 1847)**

- **Facts**: Clarissa was accused of poisoning her enslaver by putting
  Jamestown weed in coffee she made. Clarissa's enslaver whipped her
  severely, inducing her confession. Later, she confesses again when she
  has been moved from the home to the fields and is asked where she
  wanted to work and then why she poisoned him.

- **Issue:** Challenge on the indictment -- it is defective because
  Jamestown weed had not previously been established to be a poison.

- **Holding:** A confession made by a slave as result of
  torture/coercion is not admissible evidence; "the humane policy of our
  law would excuse such evidence coming from a white person, and the
  evidence is much stronger in the case of a slave."

***Wyatt v. State* (AL 1854)**

- **Facts:** Wyatt ran away from enslaver. That night, gin house burned
  down. Wyatt was captured and left overnight tied up. In the morning,
  the master showed up and found he had cut himself trying to escape.
  The master told him: "Boy, these denials only make the matter worse"
  and Wyatt responded that he burnt the gin house. Wyatt then confessed
  to a justice of the peace, with the enslaver present. He was sentenced
  to death; case appealed

- **Issue:** Was the confession valid?

- **Holding:** The confession to the enslaver and the justice must be
  excluded under the rule of Clarissa. The second confession is
  inadmissible because even though it was before a magistrate, it was
  tainted by the fact that the enslaver was present, assuming his guilt
  and demanding he confess.

**[Takeaway from both:]{.underline}** The courts in Clarissa and Wyatt
reversed the convictions of two enslaved persons, which may seem
contemporaneously "progressive." But these cases helped to perpetuate an
unjust hierarchy & inhumane system of slavery.

# CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

There is tension between *individualization and consistency.*

Post-*Furman,* states adopted pyramid statutes, weighing statutes, and
special questions statutes.

1.  Pyramid (i.e., GA)

    a.  Each layer of the pyramid is required for jury to have
        discretion to recommend death

    b.  NB: risk that there might be no real narrowing from aggravated
        murder to aggravating circumstances, since there may be overlap
        (e.g., committed in course of armed robbery)

![](media/image7.png){width="2.25in" height="1.875in"}

2.  Weighing Statutes (i.e., AL)

    a.  Jury must weigh aggravating & mitigating circumstances

        i.  No mere number counting (can't just weigh the number of
            aggravating v. mitigating circumstances)

        ii. Meant to limit discretion of jury

    b.  Difference between weighing v. pyramid: former requires weighing
        agg. v. mitt. & the latter provides jury discretion

    c.  E.g., modern AL DP statute

        i.  To be death eligible requires conviction of capital offense
            (e.g., murder for hire, murder during arson, etc.)

        ii. If conviction for capital offense case goes to jury for
            separate penalty phase trial

        iii. Jury will determine whether or not there are aggravating
             circumstances (Section 11). Only if jury finds 1+
             aggravating circumstances can they weigh that against a
             mitigating circumstance(s)

        iv. Some of these are redundant w/ capital murder

    d.  Mitigating circumstances (Sec. 13)

        i.  Statute enumerates: e.g., "The defendant has no significant
            history of prior criminal activity; (b) The capital offense
            was committed while the defendant was under the influence of
            extreme mental or emotional disturbance ... (g) The age of
            the defendant at the time of the crime."

        ii. NB: under Lockett v. Ohio, mitigating circumstances cannot
            be limited to what's enumerated

        iii. Jury then weighs aggravating v. mitigating circumstances
             recommends death or not

3.  Special Questions Statutes (i.e., TX)

    a.  At penalty phase, 3 (changed to 4) questions. If jury answers
        'yes' to all 3 (4), death:

        i.  Did the D act deliberately to kill?

        ii. Is it probable the D would commit violent crimes in the
            future?

        iii. If provoked, was it reasonable?

        iv. PLUS: Should the defendant live or die when the mitigating
            evidence is considered? This added question essentially
            introduces a weighing element

4.  Mandatory DP: totally gets rid of all discretion, but this is struck
    down in *Woodson v. NC*

***Gregg v. Georgia* (1976)** *Allows for current use of death penalty.
Just have to avoid 'arbitrary or capricious' use to clear Furman.* Death
penalty does not *per se* constitute a cruel and unusual punishment in
violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments. Not rejected by "evolving
standards of decency" (*Trop v. Dulles*)

- **Facts**: Gregg was convicted by a jury of death-eligible homicide.
  The same jury, using guidelines enacted in response to Furman, imposed
  the death sentence.

- **Issue**: Whether GA statute is permissible after *Furman.*

- **Rule**: Under Furman, DP cannot be "imposed in an arbitrary or
  capricious manner." Yet those concerns "can be met by a carefully
  drafted statute that ensures that the sentencing authority is given
  adequate information and guidance." Generally, concerns best met by
  bifurcated proceeding where sentencing authority is provided with
  standards to guide its use of info relevant to imposition of CP and
  ensure it focuses "on the particularized circumstances of the crime
  and the defendant." The Georgia statutory system under which Gregg was
  sentenced satisfies concerns of Furman and thus does not violate the
  8th & 14th Amendments.

***Atkins v. Virginia* (2002)** *execution of mentally disabled is cruel
and unusual.*

- **Facts:** Atkins was convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and
  capital murder. He was sentenced to death. During the penalty phase,
  the defense expert testified that Atkins was "mildly mentally
  retarded" and had an IQ of 59.

- **Issue:** Whether executions of mentally disabled are cruel and
  unusual prohibited by the 14th Amendment.

- **Holding:** Momentum is to ban such executions; widespread judgment
  about relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders. Two reasons
  that mentally retarded should be excluded. Serious questions as to
  whether deterrence or retribution make sense. For deterrence, the same
  cognitive and behavior impairments that make these depressants less
  morally culpable also makes it less likely that they can control their
  conduct based on the possibility of an execution. W/r/t retribution,
  severity of punishment depends on the culpability of offender; "if
  culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the
  most extreme sanction available to the state, the lesser culpability
  of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of
  retribution." Risk that DP will be imposed in spite of factors which
  may call for a less severe penalty: possibility of false confessions,
  lesser ability to show mitigation, meaningful assistance to counsel,
  demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse, some
  juries may find mental illness to be an aggravating factor that
  increases the likelihood of future dangerousness.

- **Dissent:** This decision finds no support in the text/history of the
  8th Amendment. No national consensus. The "unusuality" of capital
  punishment for the mentally ill probably reflects the fact that the
  mentally ill constitute 1-3 percent of society, not that it is looked
  down upon. Appeal to assorted professional and religious organizations
  and international law are irrelevant.

**Steiker and Steiker: Sober Second Thoughts ("Super Due Process for
Death")**

[357--360]{.mark}

- [Very few people endorse the doctrine post-Furman, and they fall into
  two camps:]{.mark}

  - [Some say court's work has burdened administrators; overly complex
    and arcane which "obstructs, delays, and defeats" the administration
    of capital punishment; sheer volume of litigation]{.mark}

  - [Some say that SCOTUS has turned its back on regulating the death
    penalty and no longer even attempts to meet the concerns about the
    arbitrary and discriminatory imposition of death; the Court has done
    nothing.]{.mark}

- [Both sets of criticisms are substantially correct: "the death penalty
  is, perversely, both under- and over- regulated." -- basically the
  regulatory regime now has not responded to the animating
  concerns]{.mark}

- [Debunking claims that this was predetermined; court could have done
  something else.]{.mark}

- [8th amendment may have helped to stabilize and entrench the practice

[CR Notes:]{.mark}

- [Critics of the death penalty believe it is either overly regulated or
  not regulated enough]{.mark}

  - [Authors argue that the "court's chosen path of death penalty
    regulation" has created "an impression of enormous regulatory effort
    but achieves negligible regulatory effects"]{.mark}

- [Court's 8th amendment jurisprudence has entrenched capital punishment
  in our society and made people more comfortable with it than they
  should be]{.mark}

[426--438]{.mark}

- SCOTUS regulation has been a disaster -- hard to imagine one worse.

- Why haven't they come up with anything better? "The Court has never
  paused to take systematic account of its death penalty
  jurisprudence.." like a house without a blueprint or "inconsistent
  blueprints drafted by warring architects" -- two unwavering poles;
  center lacks a distinctive vision about nature and scope of 8th
  amendment regulation and capital punishment

- SCOTUS has "legitimated" capital punishment with an internal
  legitimation effect

  - "These arguments range from the powerful to the plausible to the
    speculative, in inverse relation to the level of generality. At the
    most specific \"internal\" level of generality, powerful evidence
    suggests that death penalty law makes actors within the criminal
    justice system more comfortable with their roles by inducing an
    exaggerated belief in the essential rationality and fairness of the
    system."

  - Court\'s constitutionalization of capital punishment has diluted
    sen-tencing judges\' and jurors\' sense of ultimate responsibility
    for imposing the death penalty; "false sense that their power is
    safely circumscribed"

  - Social also has a strong but false sense that there are many levels
    of safeguards that protect against unjust or arbitrary executions;
    may also legitimate the larger social order and state power
    generally.

- We are left with the worst of all possible worlds: the Supreme
  Court\'s detailed attention to death penalty law has generated
  negligible improvements over the pre-Furman era, but has helped people
  to accept without second thoughts - much less \"sober\" ones - our
  profoundly failed system of capital punishment.

CR Notes:

- Two abolitionist views

  - Brennan and Marshall (and Blackmun at the end of his career) - the
    death penalty is always cruel and unusual punishment

  - Burger and Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas - SCOTUS should not regulate
    the death penalty through the 8th amendment

- Legitimation theory - inducing a false or exaggerated belief in the
  normative justifiability of something in the social world

  - Internal - extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the
    way actors within the legal system perceive the system and their
    role within it

  - Particular external - extent to which legal discourse and doctrine
    affect the way people in general view a specific social practice

  - General external - extent to which legal discourse and doctrine
    affect the way people in general view the social structure writ
    large

- Court's treatment of 8th amendment with regard to death penalty has an
  internal legitimation effect

  - Focus on controlling the discretion of capital sentences create a
    false aura of rationality, even science, around the necessarily
    moral task of deciding life or death

  - Constitutionalization of capital punishment has diluted sentencing
    judges' and jurors' sense of ultimate responsibility for imposing
    the death penalty

- The public feels a false sense of safeguards in place to prevent
  unjust or arbitrary death sentences, when in reality, the regulatory
  effects of SCOTUS's decisions are negligible in promoting justice and
  combatting discriminatory practices

CR Class Notes on Steiker x2

- Legitimation = "inducing a false or exaggerated belief in the
  normative justifiability of something in the social world -- that is,
  of inducing belief in the absence of or in contradiction to evidence
  of what the phenomena is 'really' like" (429-430)

- Gramsci = "developed the idea of 'hegemony'"; "the structure of civil
  society is maintained not merely by state power, but also by people's
  internalization of certain ideas and attitudes that make challenges to
  the existing order literally unthinkable" (430)

- Hegemony = "that the most effective kind of domination takes place
  when both the dominant and subjugated classes believe that the
  existing order, with perhaps some marginal changes, is satisfactory,
  or at least represents the most that anyone could expect, because
  things pretty much have to be the way they are" (352) (quoting Gordon)

- If the jury is told to make a conscious/moral decision, the jurors
  feel a deeper sense of responsibility. But when the jury is given
  specific instructions that they must follow that will lead to a death
  penalty sentence, the jurors feel like they are just following the law
  and not taking moral responsibility for their decision

  - In other words, the law serves as a crutch that allows jurors/judges
    to separate the moral responsibility of their sentencing decision
    from making the actual decision

***McClesky v. Kemp* (1987)**

**Facts:** M convicted of two counts of armed robbery and one count of
murder; robbery of a furniture store led to the death of a white police
officer (at least one of the shots was fired by M). The robbery was
planned by M and three others. Jury found two aggravating circumstances
of murder: armed robbery and "committed upon a peace officer engaged in
the performance of duties" (beyond a reasonable doubt). Jury recommended
death and the trial court adopted it. Claim that the GA death penalty is
administered in a racially discriminatory way and therefore violative of
8th and 14th Amendments. DC and Court of Appeals dismissed the petition,
finding it flawed.

**Baldus findings:** Even after taking 39 nonracial variables into
account, defendants charged with killing white victims were 4.3x more
likely to receive a death sentence as defendants charged with killing
blacks. Black defendants who kill white victims have the greatest
likelihood of receiving the death penalty (like McClesky).

**Issue:** Whether a complex statistical study that indicates a risk
that racial considerations enter into capital sentencing determinations
proves that petitioner McClesky's capital sentence is unconstitutional
under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment.

**Holding:** Petitioner has the burden of proving the existence of
purposeful discrimination in his case (for equal protection claims),
which he did not do. Even Baldus does not contend that his statistics
prove that race enters into death penalty decisions or that race was a
factor for M.

**Dissent:** It is irrelevant that M cannot prove the influence of race
on any particular sentencing decision; since Furman, the Court is
concerned with the RISK of imposition of arbitrary sentences, rather
than the proven fact of one. And here, M is not bringing a claim about
how the system MIGHT operate, but how it DOES.

**Chuck Lawrence: The Id, The Ego, and Equal Protection: Reckoning with
Unconscious Racism**

"A good, liberal, white person who intended to express feelings of
shared humanity"

Reconsiders Washington v. Davis

- Motive centred doctrine of racial discrimination places a very heavy,
  often impossible, burden of persuasion on the wrong side of the
  dispute

- Injury of racial inequality exists irrespective of the decisionmaker's
  motives; therefore, heightened scrutiny without consideration of
  motive

Think about discrimination in a way that more accurately describes its
origins and the nature of the injury it inflicts.

- Racism is both a crime and a disease

- Compounded by the reluctance to admit that the illness of racism
  infects everyone; "the diagnosis is difficult, because our own
  contamination with the very illness for which a cure is sought impairs
  our comprehension of the disorder"

- The intentional/unconstitutional and unintentional/constitutional
  dichotomy is "false" --

  - "Traditional notions of intent do not reflect the fact that
    decisions about racial matters are influenced in large part by
    factors that can be characterized as neither intentional
    (consciously sought) nor unintentional (in the sense that the
    outcomes are random, fortuitous, and uninfluenced by the decision
    maker\'s beliefs, desires, and wishes"

  - Race plays a dominant role in american cultural experience → shared
    attitudes, we are all affected, but we are unaware of it..
    Therefore, a large part of the behavior that produces racial
    discrimination is influenced by unconscious racial motivation.

    - Fruedian denial that WE are racist to abade discomfort.

    - Society rejects discrimination as immoral, so when an individual
      experiences conflict between racist ideas and the societal ethic
      that condemns those ideas, the mind "exclues his racism from
      consciousness"

  - Cognitive psychology states that culture transmits certain beliefs
    and preferences; because racism is so deeply ingrained in our
    culture, it is "likely to be transmitted by tacit understanding"

- Thus, intent requirement in Davis ignores what we know about how the
  human mind works; equal protection doctrine must find a way to come to
  grips with unconscious racism

- The article proposes a new test to "trigger" judicial recognition of
  race based behavior --

  - The test would evaluate governmental conduct to determine whether it
    conveys a symbolic message to which the culture attaches racial
    significance. The "cultural meaning" of an allegedly discriminatory
    act is the best analogue for a collective unconscious that we cannot
    observe directly" → strict scrutiny.

  - This is a more complete understanding of the nature of human
    motivation and would not do away with all government actions that
    have a discriminatory impact

  - This is important because the burden of intent is super high, and
    the existing intent requirement's assignment of individual fault
    distorts our perceptions about the causes of discrimination and
    leads us to think about racism in a way that advances the disease
    rather than combating it. Also, the intent doctrine's focus on the
    narrowest and most unrealistic understanding of individual fault has
    engendered much of the resistance to, and resentment of, affirmative
    action remedies for past and continuing discrimination.
    Understanding the cultural source of racism obviates the need for
    fault. "We cannot be individually blamed for unconsciously harboring
    attitudes that are inescapable in a culture permeated with racism"

  - This will also held us combat the hegemony of the ideology of equal
    opportunity/the law as a hegemonic tool of domination

  - Due process is infringed by both self conscious and unconscious
    racism; justifies judicial intervention

  - Anti discrimination principle, which involves "interpreting
    fundamental moral values that are widely shared in our society"
    justifies this judicial intervention.

# SEXUAL ASSAULT

***State v. Rusk* (1981)**

- **Facts**: Pat met Rusk at a bar and gave him a ride home. They
  arrived in an unfamiliar neighborhood & Rusk grabbed her keys. Pat
  testifies that she went in because she was scared. She asked that if
  she did what he wanted, would he let her go without killing her (no
  response). When she started to cry, she says he began to "lightly
  choke" her. She asked if she did what he wanted whether he would let
  her go (yes). Sex ensued.

- **Statute**: "Vaginal intercourse...by force or the threat of force,
  without consent of the other"

- **Actus Reus: "**Lack of consent is generally established through
  proof of resistance or by proof that the victim failed to resist
  because of fear." "The victim's fear must be genuine," and "reasonably
  grounded"

- **Issue:** Can lack of consent be proven by proof of resistance or
  lack of resistance due to fear?

- **Holding:** Lack of consent is generally established through proof of
  resistance or by proof that the victim failed to resist because of
  fear." "Considering all of the evidence in the case, with particular
  focus upon the actual force applied by Rusk to Pat\'s neck, we
  conclude that the jury could rationally find that the essential
  elements of second degree rape had been established and that Rusk was
  guilty of that offense beyond a reasonable doubt." Court endorses
  objective standard for victim's failure to resist due to fear:
  prosecution has burden of proving victim's fear was subjectively
  genuine & objectively reasonable. "The victim\'s fear be reasonably
  grounded in order to obviate the need for either proof of actual force
  on the part of the assailant or physical resistance on the part of the
  victim."

- **Dissent**: Prosecutrix's fear should only be a question after the
  court determines if the ∆'s conduct was reasonably calculated to give
  rise to fear to the extent that she was unable to resist. Can't only
  be seen through victim's lens. "She must follow the natural instinct
  of every proud female to resist, by more than mere words, the
  violation of her person by a stranger or an unwelcome friend. She must
  make it plain that she regards such sexual acts as abhorrent and
  repugnant to her natural sense of pride. She must resist unless the ∆
  has objectively manifested his intent to use physical force to
  accomplish his purpose.

- **Notes:** Majority & dissent disagree about mens rea (negligence v.
  purpose)

<!-- -->

- Majority: implied negligence standard (although it can feel like
  strict liability, since court does not inquire into defendant's mental
  state)

- Negligence since a reasonable person in defendant's situation would
  have seen that his actions (e.g., taking the car keys) would cause
  fear of threat of force (or was itself force)

***State v. DiPetrillo* (RI 2007)**

- **Facts**: Victim was called over to boss' desk one night. "He grabbed
  her by the wrist, pulled her onto his lap, and began kissing her.
  According to Jane, she initially did not react and she kissed him
  back." She repeatedly told him to stop. "This resistance was
  unavailing. DiPetrillo continued his assault by pulling Jane\'s pants
  and underwear down to her knees and then digitally penetrating her
  vagina..." She eventually walked away.

- **Issue**: Does the psychological-coercion-of-a-susceptible-victim
  standard for sexual assault apply to implied threats that arose solely
  in the context of an employment relationship?

- Holding: No. The standard that "Force or coercion may also consist of
  the imposition of psychological pressure upon a person who, under all
  of the circumstances, is vulnerable and susceptible to such pressure"
  should not apply to employment contexts. Here, it is uncertain whether
  a "modicum of physical force" alone constitutes "force or coercion."

***State in the Interest of M.T.S.* (1992)**

- **Facts**: "The record in the case discloses that the juvenile, a
  seventeen-year-old boy, engaged in consensual kissing and heavy
  petting with a fifteen-year-old girl and thereafter engaged in actual
  sexual penetration of the girl to which she had not consented. There
  was no evidence or suggestion that the juvenile used any unusual or
  extra force or threats to accomplish the act of penetration." Statute
  requires "physical force or coercion"

- **Issue**: how much force is necessary

- **Holding:** Penetration (without consent) itself constitutes
  force."Any act of sexual penetration engaged in by the defendant
  without the affirmative and freely-given permission of the victim to
  the specific act of penetration constitutes the offense of sexual
  assault. Therefore, physical force in excess of that inherent in the
  act of sexual penetration is not required for such penetration to be
  unlawful." "The definition of "physical force" is satisfied if the
  defendant applies any amount of force against another person in the
  absence of what a reasonable person would believe to be affirmative
  and freely-given permission to the act of sexual penetration."
  Affirmative permission can through words or actions---no evidence of
  either in this case.

  - The legislative intent of trying to "eliminate any consideration of
    whether the victim resisted or expressed non-consent" would not be
    served by requiring force beyond penetration

- **Notes:** Court is essentially introducing a mens rea of negligence,
  since physical force is satisfied by reference to the reasonable
  person. Court is trying to move away from the acts or mental state of
  the victim---and yet it returns to that in requiring affirmative
  consent based on what victim said or did: focuses on victim's conduct
  and words. Lack of affirmative consent is non-consent (very
  victim-friendly)

***Commonwealth v. Sherry* (MA 1982)** *Don't need actual knowledge of
lack of consent for rape: The BELIEF has to be REASONABLE.*

- **Facts**: Victim was a nurse who attended a party also attended by
  the three defendants, doctors. According to the victim, the men
  brought her to one of their homes and, feeling "physically numbed" she
  had intercourse with each of them in turn. "Each defendant testified
  that the victim consented to the acts of intercourse." Defendants
  request an instruction re: actual knowledge.

- **Issue**: Is a defendant's mistaken belief that the victim had
  consented a defense to the charge of rape?

- **Holding:** No, "we are aware of no American court of last resort
  that recognizes mistake of fact, without consideration of its
  reasonableness as a defense...". Victim said no -- any implication
  other than non-consent in the defendant's mind is irrelevant

- **Notes:** Mens rea: Court rejects defendants' attempt to use mistake
  of fact to impose a mens rea of actual knowledge; instead court
  retains something like strict liability/negligence

***Commonwealth v. Fischer - mens rea of negligence for rape***

- **Facts**: Victim & defendant were college students. They had two
  sexual encounters, with the victim claiming the second occurred
  through force despite her protestations. Defendant wanted a reasonable
  mistake of fact defense. ∆ convicted, appealed for ineffective
  assistance of counsel for failing to bring a mistake of fact claim

- **Issue**: Is mistake of fact that a victim consented to a defendant's
  sexual conduct a defense to the crime of involuntary deviate sexual
  intercourse?

- **Holding**: Counsel is not ineffective as he failed to predict future
  developments/changes in law. Cannot pursue a baseless claim.

# WHAT WE CRIMINALIZE: CRIMINAL LAW AND MORALITY

**[John Stuart Mill "On Liberty"]{.underline}**

- Addressed: When can the government regulate something? Which liberties
  shouldn't be regulated?

- Propositions: we should be entitled to certain kinds of freedom

  - Shouldn't be any interference with anyone's liberty unless society
    is trying to protect itself (protect social order / community)

  - Certain interests ought to be considered as rights and shouldn't be
    infringed upon\\

  - Harm principle: you should not in any way limit someone unless they
    are going to cause harm to someone else

**[Lord James Fitzjames Stephen]{.underline}**

- Thesis: Criminal law doesn't need to just look at harm, it can enforce
  morality (always has and always will -- that's what it's about)

  - \[T\]here are acts of wickedness so gross and outrageous that,
    self-protection apart, they must be prevented as far as possible at
    any cost to the offender, and punished, if they occur, with
    exemplary severity"

**[HLA Hart: cosigns simplest version of Mill's harm
principle]{.underline}**

**[Lord Patrick Devlin "Morals and the Criminal Law"]{.underline}**

- "the law must base itself on Christian morals. . . . \[W\]ithout the
  help of Christian teaching the law will fail"

  - "the law exists for the protection of society" / institutions so
    people can live together

  - Tolerate maximum individual freedom but express majority opprobrium
    in the criminal law

**[Hart-Devlin Debates]{.underline}**

- Hart/Mill: Harm principle = "the only purpose for which power can be
  rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against
  his will, is to prevent harm to others"

- Devlin/Stephen: Legal moralism = the criminal law is always based on
  moral principles and serves to uphold a moral order

  - "Immoral" activities should be criminalized because they are immoral

[Hart/Devlin and Betham/Kant → CRYSTALLINE CONNECTION!]{.underline}

- Harm principle is utilitarian.

- Kant is concerned with "categorical imperatives" or maxims we should
  all live by.

\[Notes from Courtney and Kevin that are helpful\]

Lord Stephen - Crime should be about incentivizing what people should
do. You should act in the way that an upstanding citizen would act.

John Stuart Mills, "On Liberty": Infringing on the liberty of another
through your actions by harming others justifies criminalization.

Tracks to Utilitarianism/Kant: \[Think Kant\] Categorical imperative =
creating maxims that everyone can and should always act according to.
Harm principle can be a categorical imperative example. One should never
act in a way that harms others (third party harms). This is a universal
maxim that guides out actions and structures our society. OR \[Think
Kant\] Kant is aspirational and related to legal moralism. What kind of
person should you be, what kind of actions should you take? Kant imposes
goals on society to be the best possible version of itself (what does
that mean for society?).

\[Bentham\] Utilitarianism -- harm reduces collective happiness. The
harm principle is fundamentally utilitarian. Utilitarians want to
maximize pleasure for the most people. The harm principle (you can do
whatever you want so long as you don't harm others) is fundamentally
utilitarian. \[Kant and Bentham, more generally, speak to the type of
society that we want to live in.\]

Legal Positivism -- meaningful harms, allow for liberal legal changes.
Harm principle falls here. We are enforcing a principle (abstractly)
that is removed from any sense of morality. There are no substantive
normative judgements applied here. We can reach the right decision based
on abstract principles applied to all scenarios, completely divorced
from our own moral ideology.

Legal moralism vs. Legal positivism -- the belief that these acts, in
and of themselves, are wrongs. Kant focuses on the ends. Think Norman,
you could use the facts of the scenario to justify the killing. Kant
would say NO. Homicide is in and of itself, always wrong.

Justifications and Defenses:

Think People v. Goetz. \[What part of the subjective/objective elements
of the standard that can you exploit? Make the best argument on either
side.\]

Battered Woman's Syndrome and lack of complete defense vs. Heat of
Passion providing a complete defense.

When is self-defense allowed to be perfect, and against whom?

How does the law think about power relations between different genders,
different races?

How do your perceptions of self-defense change as the fact patterns
change? Why are you consistent or inconsistent?

What is imminent (time-framing) when you have been suffering abuse for
20 years? Is imminent = instantaneous?

**[Discussion: What would a reasonable legal moralist say about changing
morals in society? Should the criminal law reflect that?]{.underline}**

- Key question: would reflecting that change serve the health /
  integrity of society? → Important to change the law because if law
  doesn't reflect people's moral norms, there will be chaos / uprising

  - But maybe a change in the law helps push a change in moral norms?
    (i.e., abolishing death penalty spurred decrease in support for
    death penalty)

- Arguments about legal moralism transformed into arguments about harm →
  collapse of harm principle

  - Now most people think harm principle prevails so it's inappropriate
    to just enforce morality (Hart won)

  - So now legal moralists have to fit their argument about prohibiting
    "immorality" into ideas of harm, not morality = collapse

    - i.e., shift from drugs as victimless (and just immoral) crimes to
      "this is your brain on drugs"

    - But then in response to this, drug legalizers say "your war on
      drugs causes more harm" so now drug conversation focuses on "harm
      reduction" language (would reduce overall harm of these substances
      to make them legal)

    - SO NOW harm principle doesn't help distinguish what to regulate,
      we're just measuring and balancing harms

      - i.e., regulate pornography / sex work because it causes harm to
        those involved and contributes to rape culture.

***Bowers v. Hardwick* (1986)**

- **Facts**: A Georgia statute criminalized oral and anal sex. Hardwick,
  and adult male, was charged with violating the statute with another
  adult male in Hardwick's home. The District Attorney decided not to
  pursue the matter before a grand jury. Hardwick challenged the
  statute's constitutionality in federal district court, arguing that as
  a homosexual he was at risk of being arrested under the statute again
  in the future. The district court dismissed the suit for failing to
  state a claim. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding
  that Hardwick's homosexual activities were private and could not be
  regulated by state law under the Ninth Amendment and the Due Process
  Clause, and that the Georgia statute therefore violated Hardwick's
  fundamental rights.

- **Issue**: Does the U.S. Constitution provide a fundamental right to
  engage in homosexual sodomy?

  - Under pure harm principle, we would say that, to criminalize
    conduct, we need more than just a claim that the moral order will
    unravel → sodomy shouldn't be criminalized

  - Under pure legal moralism, if this is beyond level of tolerance →
    should be criminalized

- **Holding**: majority fails to find "right" of queer people "to engage
  in sodomy" → can be criminalized

***Lawrence v. Texas* (2003)**

- **Facts**: Police officers were dispatched to the home of John
  Lawrence (defendant) in response to a report of a weapons disturbance.
  When the police went into the home, the police observed Lawrence and
  Tyron Garner (defendant) engaged in a sexual act. The State of Texas
  (plaintiff) charged Lawrence and Garner with engaging in deviate
  sexual intercourse with a person of the same sex. Lawrence and Garner
  were convicted by a Justice of the Peace and exercised their right to
  a new trial in criminal court. Lawrence and Garner argued that the
  statute was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The criminal
  court rejected the arguments, and Lawrence and Garner entered a plea
  of nolo contendere. The court of appeals confirmed the convictions,
  and Lawrence and Garner petitioned the United States Supreme Court for
  review.

- **Issue**: were petitioners "free as adults to engage in the private
  conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process
  Clause?"

- **Holding**: morality is not a sufficient basis to criminalize this
  conduct (adopted harm principle)

  - Harcourt: this was the first time SCOTUS rejected "Devlin"

***Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org* (2022)**

- **Facts:** In 2018, Mississippi enacted the Gestational Age Act, which
  generally prohibited abortion of fetuses with a gestational age of
  more than 15 weeks. In enacting the statute, the Mississippi
  legislature asserted a state interest in protecting unborn life.
  Mississippi and 25 other states asked the Court to overrule Roe and
  Casey and return regulation of abortion to the individual states.

- **Issue:** Is abortion a fundamental right?

- **Holding:** Majority fails to find "the right to obtain an abortion,"
  "the right to privacy," "the freedom to make intimate personal
  choices" that are "central to personal dignity and autonomy" in the
  constitution. History of criminalization → against finding fundamental
  right. Countervailing interest in life of the fetus (morality / harm
  principle come in here) → passes rational basis.

  - Alito acknowledges that abortion is a moral issue.

  - Thomas: SDP has harmed the country

**[Harcourt, The Collapse of the Harm Principle]{.underline}**

The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any
member of a civilized community against his will, is to prevent harm to
others.

- Produced a blueprint of a "highly regulated society"

- Legal enforcement of morality brings this to mind.

  - Hart/Feinberg: liberals

  - Devlin: pro legal moralism; ambivalence in the notion of harm

- To Hart/Feinberg, Moderate thesis = public harm. Extreme thesis: legal
  moralism.

- Devlin defined public morality in terms of harm to society. Harm gives
  rise to standing.

  - Modern interpretation: morality should be enforced to protect
    society from the danger of disintegration (differently, Hart focused
    on the harm to the individual)

  - But he did not articulate the causation/pathway of harm.\] and
    provided no evidence.

  - Extreme interpretation: morality for morality's sake.

- Hart/Feinberg and the simple harm principle: pared down to its
  original, simple formulation

  - Liberalism defined as "the view that as a class, harm and offense
    prevention are far and away the best reasons that can be produced in
    support of criminal prohibitions, and the only ones that frequently
    outweigh the case for liberty... the only considerations that are
    always good reasons for criminalization."

- \[FROM QCW\]: BH argued that the harm principle, originally
  articulated in John Stuart Mill's essay On Liberty (1859), had
  collapsed under the weight of its own success and no longer serves,
  today, as a limiting principle on the legal enforcement of morality.

  - Over time, a consensus emerged that the liberal harm principle
    prevailed in the legal philosophic debate over the enforcement of
    morality.

  - Today, the hegemony of the modern harm principle, developed by
    liberal legal thinkers at mid-twentieth century, continues to
    generate a proliferation of harm arguments, and the competing claims
    of non-trivial harms have effectively neutralized the limiting
    function of the harm principle.

  - Today, the harm principle is being used increasingly by
    conservatives who justify laws against prostitution, pornography,
    public drinking, drugs, and loitering, as well as regulation of
    homosexual and heterosexual conduct, on the basis of harm to others.

  - The conservative harm arguments are powerful. By endorsing the harm
    principle and simultaneously making harm arguments, the proponents
    of legal enforcement have disarmed the progressive position and the
    traditional progressive reliance on the harm principle. This has
    significantly changed the structure of the debate over the legal
    enforcement of morality.

  - IN SUM: The modern harm principle has prevailed over legal moralism,
    but its victory and the resulting proliferation of prohibitionist
    harm arguments have sapped the modern harm principle of any limiting
    function on the legal enforcement of morals.

# JUSTIFICATIONS AND EXCUSES

## Self Defense

***United States v. Peterson* (1973)**

- **Facts**: Victim and two friends drove into the alley of defendant's
  home to remove the windshield wipers from Peteron's car. Peterson came
  out in protest. After a verbal exchange, Peterson got a pistol and
  came back out (at that time, victim and friends were in their own
  car). Peterson said "if you move, I will shoot." "If you come in here,
  I will kill you." Victim walked back to the car to get a lug wrench,
  and walked closer to Peterson. Victim walked closer to Peterson and
  Peterson told him to stop. Victim did not stop, and Peterson shot him
  in the face.

- **Procedure**: Peterson was indicted for second degree murder and
  convicted of manslaughter as a lesser offense. Peterson's complaint
  centers upon an instruction that the right to use deadly force is not
  ordinarily available to one who provokes a conflict or the aggressor
  in it. Peterson says there was no evidence that he contributed to the
  conflict.

- **Issue**: Were the trial court's instructions regarding self defense
  correct? And was there a factual predicate for the finding that
  Peterson was the aggressor?

- **Reasoning**: Fundamental principle that killing in self defense is
  only excusable as a matter of genuine necessity → trial judge's
  instruction comported with those principles. The evidence is
  uncontradicted that when Peterson reappeared, the victim was about to
  depart. He was no longer the aggressor at that point. "An affirmative
  unlawful act reasonably calculated to produce an affray foreboding
  injurious or fatal consequences is an aggression which, unless
  renounced, nullifies the right of homicidal self defense." → Jury
  could have found Peterson's challenge to be of that character.

***People v. Goetz* (1986)**

- **Facts**: Goetz had been mugged before, after which he started
  carrying an unlicensed handgun. One afternoon he was on the subway, as
  were four Black youths (two of whom had screwdrivers on them). They
  went up to him and demanded \$. "Goetz responded by standing "firing
  four shots in rapid succession" at the center of the body of each
  youth. He then fired another shot at one of the wounded. Goetz later
  stated that "Although he was certain that none of the youths had a
  gun, he had a fear, based on prior experiences, of being 'maimed.'"
  "His stated intention at that point was to "murder \[the four
  youths\]." • "The lower courts, concluding that the prosecutor\'s
  charge to the Grand Jury on the defense of justification was
  erroneous, have dismissed the" charges. Appellate Division interpreted
  NYPL §35.15 ("reasonably believes") to mean "is whether a defendant\'s
  beliefs and reactions were "reasonable to him".

- **Issue**: Is the self-defense standard in NYS objective or
  subjective?

- **Holding**: Reasonable person standard is blended (objective and
  subjective). It is reasonable given the defendant\'s experiences. Even
  if Goetz was somehow authorized to use force, there is no
  justification whatsoever for his continuing to shoot after the
  \"threat\" had dissipated.

  - The legal standard legitimates Goetz's racially-motivated killing
    because it allows the jury to act on the racially-biased views
    they've imbued from society (e.g., racially-biased crime stats). In
    their eyes, the youths had attempted to rob Goetz (despite no
    conclusive evidence of that) and his violence was justified as
    vigilantism. Of course, if the races were flipped, the outcome would
    have been different. Although official standards (e.g.,
    "reasonableness") are meant to exclude racial bias, they fail to do
    so in practice.

|          |              or serious bodily harm.                      |
|          |                                                           |
|          | (b) The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this |

|          |     bodily harm, kidnapping or sexual intercourse         |
|          |     compelled by force or threat; nor is it justifiable   |

|          |     (i) the actor, with the purpose of causing death or   |
|          |         serious bodily injury, provoked the use of force  |
|          |         against himself in the same encounter; or         |
|          |                                                           |
|          |     (ii) the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity  |
|          |          of using such force with complete safety by      |

|          |              justified in using force in his assistance   |

|          | (c) Except as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  |
|          |     Subsection, a person employing protective force may   |
|          |     estimate the necessity thereof under the              |
|          |     circumstances as he believes them to be when the      |
|          |     force is used, without retreating, surrendering       |
|          |     possession, doing any other act which he has no legal |

|          | takes all reasonable measures to terminate the            |
|          | confinement as soon as he knows that he safely can,       |
|          | unless the person confined has been arrested on a charge  |

## Battered Women's Syndrome

***State v. Norman* (NC 1989)** *Takeaway: to claim battered woman
syndrome as a perfect self-defense, the threat must be something
concrete and material at the time of the use*

*of force, not an ongoing, consistent threat of abuse*

- **Facts**: Δ was married to a highly abusive husband who for years
  frequently threatened to kill her and to maim her. The day before she
  killed her husband, he beat her really badly and she tried to kill
  herself -- she was clearly feeling like she was out of options. His
  abuse had escalated in the days leading up to death. She went into the
  husband's room and shot him as he slept.

- **Issue:** Will evidence of battered-wife syndrome absolutely justify
  a killing of an abusive spouse?

- **Holding**: Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on
  perfect self-defense because she did not believe "it to be necessary
  to kill the decedent to save herself from imminent death or great
  bodily harm." Self-defense is only available to protect against
  imminent harm, not against threat of future harm.

  - Perfect: evidence, viewed in light most favorable to defendant,
    tends to show that at the time of the killing it appeared to the
    defendant and she reasonably believed it to be necessary to kill her
    husband to save herself from imminent death or great bodily harm.

  - Imperfect: when defendant is the initial aggressor, but without
    intent to kill / seriously injure, and decedent escalates
    confrontation

  - Where defendant reasonably believes there's imminent threat of death
    / great bodily harm → reduced liability

- **Notes**: Narrow time-framing: Ongoing, consistent threat of abuse
  won't cut it. The threat must be something concrete and material at
  the time of the act of self-defense.

## Duty to Retreat and Stand Your Ground Laws

Duty to Retreat

- Common law: English common law: "strict duty to retreat; a person
  could use deadly force in self-defense only after exhausting every
  chance to flee." (921)

- American law: "In the 19th c., American courts began rejecting the
  English doctrine... by the late 19th or early 20th c., the majority
  had adopted the 'true man' or no-retreat rule."

- Recent case law: True man/no retreat/SYG rule considered the majority
  approach

  - MPC adopts a version of this rule with some exceptions.

  - "In decisions based on common-law principles, there has been a
    distinct tendency to favor a requirement of retreat in settings
    outside the home... recently, however, many judicial decisions
    reaffirming the retreat requirement have been nullified by
    legislation."

- The castle exception

  - "In jurisdictions requiring retreat before deadly force may be used,
    an exception is invariably made when the defendant is attack in his
    own home by an intruder." E.g., People v. Tomlins (NY CoA, 1914)

    - Guests: "The great majority permit the homeowner to kill \[a
      guest\] in self-defense" without having a duty to retreat.

    - Co-occupants: Most recent decisions support right of homeowner to
      kill co-occupant in self-defense without having a duty to retreat

    - Domestic abusers: Courts say a duty to retreat would adversely
      affect victims of domestic violence--- but won't women be placed
      in even greater danger because their abusers don't have a duty to
      retreat either

- Stand Your Ground Laws

  - SYG Statutes

  - Basic idea: Even if you can retreat, you've no duty to do so. You
    can stay and meet force w/ force (even deadly force)

  - Erodes the necessity requirement for self-defense

  - Other features:

    - Presumption that a person using deadly force while in her home or
      vehicle had a reasonable fear of imminent death

    - Immunity from both civil & criminal liability if killer was
      justified no prosecution

    - Procedural consequences:

      - Police cannot arrest killer unless they determine there is
        probable cause the force used as unlawful

      - Immunity hearing (see above). Δ had burden of proof.

      - If someone invokes SYG law, they cannot be arrested until
        there's probable cause that SYG isn't applicable. The burden
        shift makes it difficult to demonstrate that defendant stood
        ground unlawfully

  - Critics: Increases homicide rate by excusing unnecessary killings;
    will increase vigilantism; will increase danger of fatal mistakes
    (often prompted by racial prejudice)

    - ABA report (2015): SYG laws "have no deterrent effect on violent
      crimes... Rather the evidence tells a story of mounting problems
      with the implementation of these laws and unintended, negative
      implications for racial and ethnic minorities, law enforcement,
      the criminal justice system, and public safety."

    - Great potential for racial bias (see above)

## Law Enforcement Use of Lethal Force

- ​Purpose: Decide whether there is sufficient evidence (i.e., probable
  cause) to charge a person w/ a crime

  - Low bar: only fair probability

  - Grand jury practice varies by state

- Most, but not all states require a grand jury (right to grand jury in
  the 5th Am. isn't incorporated)

  - Some states, instead of grand jury, have "information" filed by
    prosecutor, followed by prosecutor showing evidence of probable
    cause to judge w/ defendant present

  - In many states, grand jury need not be unanimous

  - In a state like NY, for a typical felony: arrest review by assistant
    DA grand jury arraignment

  - Misdemeanors & violations don't require a grand jury

  - At every stage, there's opportunity for defendant to plead guilty
    (that's the pressure of the system)

  - Prosecutor instructs jury on the law, effectively controlling grand
    jury (no judge, no defense counsel, no Δ)

  - Prosecutor makes case to grand jurors, brings in usually 1-2
    witnesses (e.g., officer, victim)

  - Sometimes grand jurors can direct questions at witness

  - For most cases, these are pro forma proceedings---a grand jury would
    indict a ham sandwich

  - Grand juries (like preliminary-hearing judges) almost always ratify
    prosecutor's decision

  - "As a result, the prosecutor wields enormous power, deciding whether
    to press charges or drop a case, whether to file the most serious
    charge or lesser offenses, and whether to reduce the charges after
    they are filed." (10)

  - BUT at federal level, grand juries are sometimes investigatory tools
    (e.g., for a complex white-collar crime, prosecutors will use grand
    jury to issue subpoena)

  - If the grand jury "true bills" the indictment the case proceeds to
    arraignment. If it "no bills" the indictment the case does not
    proceed

  - Double jeopardy does *not* attach to a grand jury proceeding. So,
    **possible next steps:**

    - A later grand jury can issue an indictment

    - In some jurisdictions a special prosecutor (appointed by governor
      or court) might later be appointed

    - Federal prosecution could ensue

    - Victim's family could bring a civil wrongful death suit in federal
      court

  - "In many jurisdictions, a grand jury is convened to review **every**
    police-involved homicide. A prosecutor who, while accountable to an
    electorate, must also rely on the police department to bring him
    cases, will frequently find it very useful to attribute a decision
    not to bring criminal charges to the grand jury. This means that
    police shootings will sometimes be presented to a grand jury in a
    situation where, had a civilian been involved, the prosecutor would
    have made no presentation."

  - Grand juries rarely issue indictments in police killing cases.
    **Often, grand juries are used in police killings to mimic a trial &
    verdict** (*see*
    [[here]{.underline}](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2668353))

  - Prosecutor wants to convince world there's been trial & verdict &
    thus truth has been determined.

  - E.g., Brown, Garner cases: incredible number of witnesses

|          |                                                           |

|          |           innocent persons; and                           |

|          |              threatened use of deadly force; or           |

|          | justifiably have been employed to effect the arrest under |
|          | which the person is in custody, except that a guard or    |
|          | other person authorized to act as a peace officer is      |
|          | justified in using any force, including deadly force,     |
|          | which he believes to be immediately necessary to prevent  |
|          | the escape of a person from a jail, prison, or other      |
|          | institution for the detention of persons charged with or  |
|          | convicted of a crime.                                     |

|          | (a) A private person who is summoned by a peace officer   |
|          |     to assist in effecting an unlawful arrest is          |
|          |     justified in using any force which he would be        |
|          |     justified in using if the arrest were lawful,         |
|          |     provided that he does not believe the arrest is       |
|          |     unlawful.                                             |

|          |     in effecting an unlawful arrest, or who, not being    |
|          |     summoned, assists a peace officer in effecting an     |
|          |     unlawful arrest, is justified in using any force      |
|          |     which he would be justified in using if the arrest    |
|          |     were lawful, provided that (i) he believes the arrest |
|          |     is lawful, and (ii) the arrest would be lawful if the |
|          |     facts were as he believes them to be.                 |
|          |                                                           |
|          | \(5\) Use of Force to Prevent Suicide or the Commission   |

|          | (a) The use of force upon or toward the person of another |
|          |     is justifiable when the actor believes that such      |
|          |     force is immediately necessary to prevent such other  |
|          |     person from committing suicide, inflicting serious    |
|          |     bodily harm upon himself, committing or consummating  |
|          |     the commission of a crime involving or threatening    |

|          |     (ii) the use of deadly force is not in any event      |
|          |          justifiable under this Subsection unless:        |
|          |                                                           |

|          |              substantial risk that the person whom he     |
|          |              seeks to prevent from committing a crime     |
|          |              will cause death or serious bodily harm to   |

|          |              consummation of the crime is prevented and   |
|          |              that the use of such force presents no       |
|          |              substantial risk of injury to innocent       |
|          |              persons; or                                  |

|          |          (2) the actor believes that the use of such      |
|          |              force is necessary to suppress a riot or     |
|          |              mutiny after the rioters or mutineers have   |
|          |              been ordered to disperse and warned, in any  |
|          |              particular manner that the law may require,  |
|          |              that such force will be used if they do not  |
|          |              obey.                                        |

|          |     (iii) The justification afforded by this Subsection   |
|          |           extends to the use of confinement as preventive |
|          |           force only if the actor takes all reasonable    |
|          |           measures to terminate the confinement as soon   |
|          |           as he knows that he safely can, unless the      |
|          |           person confined has been arrested on a charge   |

## Necessity and Duress

***Regina v. Dudley and Stephens***

- **Facts**: 3 men and their cabin boy were stranded \[Dudley (sailing
  master), Stephens (lots of sailing experience), Brooks, Parker (cabin
  boy who fell ill)\]. Brooks did not consent to drawing lots or to
  killing Parker, but the Dudley & Stephens proceeded to kill Parker
  nonetheless. All three fed on him. 3 days later, the men were saved.

- **Charge**: Dudley and Stephens charged with murder of Parker. Third
  man, Brooks, was prosecution witness

- **Reasoning**: There is a doctrine of self defense (pg. 91), but that
  doesn't apply here (no necessity defense in England at this time (pg.
  92)).

  - "there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing was
    justified by what has been called "necessity." But the temptation to
    the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called
    necessity. Immoral -- we should follow example of Christ and be
    willing to sacrifice ourselves for other people

- **Holding**: death sentence; sentences later commuted, and defendants
  not executed.

- **Notes:** Other non-Christian ways to resolve this case?
  Alternatively, would it have been "better" or "more Christian" to draw
  lots and randomize or for captain to sacrifice himself?

  - Choice of lesser evils: utilitarianism

    - Parker was a less experienced sailor, wouldn't be able to help
      them get to safety

    - Parker doesn't have family, so less of a loss

    - Parker has more life ahead of him

- Any deterrence value from sentencing the defendants to death here?

  - It is unlikely that people in this circumstance in the future would,
    under threat of starvation, be deterred because of threat of later
    potentially being sentenced to death

***People v. Unger***

- **Facts**: Unger escaped prison and was captured/charged. He argued
  that he was being threatened and sexually assaulted by inmates, so he
  needed to escape to save his life. Jury was instructed NT to consider
  reasons for his alleged escape as a justification or excuse

- **Issue**: was it error for the jury to be instructed that it must
  disregard Unger's reasons for escape?

  - In IL, the legal standard for necessity was that the accused was
    without blame in occasioning or developing the situation and
    reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or
    private injury greater than the injury which might reasonably result
    from their own conduct

  - This sounds in lesser of two evils: "injury greater than the injury
    that might reasonably result from his own conduct"

  - This also sounds in necessity: "reasonably believed such conduct was
    necessary to prevent"

- **Holding**: Not adopting *Lovercamp* standard (one is entitled to a
  necessity jury instruction when 1) the prisoner is faced with specific
  threat of death, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury
  in the immediate future 2) no time for complaint of history to the
  authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints 3) no time
  or opportunity to resort to the courts 4) no evidence of force or
  violence used toward prison personnel or other "innocent" persons in
  the escape and 5) immediately alerts proper authorities when they have
  attained a position of safety from the immediate threat (Unger did not
  do this)). These factors are relevant but not required; affirm remand
  for a new trial where the jury may consider the reasons for his
  escape.

- **Dissent**: unless narrowly circumscribed, this defense will lead to
  future escapes and lead to injury to police, etc.

***U.S. v. Schoon***

- Facts: Protestors occupied IRS building to protest US involvement in
  El Salvador, obstructing the office's operation. They request a
  necessity defense.

- Issue: Are the protestors entitled to a necessity defense?

- Holding: No. There is a difference between direct and indirect civil
  disobedience. Petitioning Congress to change a policy is always a
  legal alternative in such cases, regardless of the likelihood of the
  plea's success" so committing a crime isn't necessary

  - Direct: "involves protesting the existence of a law by breaking that
    law or by preventing the execution of that law in a specific
    instance in which a particularized harm would otherwise follow."

  - Indirect: "involves violating a law or interfering with a government
    policy that is not, itself, the object of protest."

  - "To invoke the necessity defense, therefore, the defendants
    colorably must have shown that: 1) they were faced with a choice of
    evils and chose the lesser evil; 2) they acted to prevent imminent
    harm \[contra MPC, Unger\]; 3) they reasonably anticipated a direct
    causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be
    averted; and 4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the
    law."

- Takeaway: Necessity is per se inapplicable to cases of indirect civil
  disobedience because: (1) existence of law or policy is not a legally
  cognizable harm; because the act is indirect, it is unlikely to abate
  the evil; and (3) there are legal alternatives available (e.g.,
  petition Cong.)

***State v. Toscano***

- **Facts:** Toscano participated in a scheme to defraud insurance
  companies by providing false medical reports. He "maintained he agreed
  to take part because the ringleader threatened him and his wife with
  physical harm otherwise.

- **Issue:** Was Toscano entitled to introduce evidence re: duress and a
  jury instruction?

- **Holding:** Henceforth, duress shall be a defense to a crime other
  than murder if the defendant engaged in conduct because he was coerced
  to do so by the use of, or threat to use, unlawful force against his
  person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness
  in his situation would have been unable to resist." The defendant was
  entitled to a defense of duress since the requisite elements of the
  defense \[as synthesized by the court\] were established.

- **Takeaway:** Duress is an objective standard -- a situation inducing
  fear such that a man of ordinary fortitude & courage would yield

***U.S. v. Fleming***

- **Facts:** Defendant was POW charged w/ helping North Korea produce
  propaganda. Δ refused to aid captors, but they threatened to force him
  to march barefoot in midwinter 200 miles or to stick him in a cave.
  Either threat was tantamount to death.

- **Issue:** Does duress require fear of *immediate* death?

- **Holding:** Flemings' resistance had not brought him to the last
  ditch; the danger of death or serious bodily injury was not immediate.
  Court upheld the conviction because the defendant cooperated upon the
  "mere assertion" of threats... It was not at all certain at the time
  the threat was made that walking north would cause death at all, much
  less immediately\... Here the danger of death was problematical and
  remote."

## Theoretical Interlude: Law and Economics

[General takeaways]{.underline}

- L&E attempts to ground criminal punishment policy in
  "scientific"/"objective" efficiency & utility-based justifications,
  and is predicated on the seeming belief that economic
  modeling/rational choice theory can be applied universally

- L&E seeks to model legal rules so as to maximize efficiency and social
  welfare

- L&E framework is inaccurate & in any case impracticable (we're in law
  school because we're bad at math)

- Formulates a measure of "social loss" from offenses and finds those
  expenditures of resources and punishments that minimize this loss. The
  general criterion of social loss is shown to incorporate as special
  cases, valid under special assumptions, the criteria of vengeance,
  deterrence, compensation, and rehabilitation that historically have
  figured so prominently in practice and criminological literature.

- The optimal amount of enforcement is shown to depend on, inter alia,
  the cost of catching and convicting offenders, the nature of
  punishments (i.e. whether they are fines or prison terms -- and the
  responses of offenders to changes in enforcement)

    - How many resources and how much punishment should be used to
      enforce different kinds of legislation?

    - How many offenses should be permitted and how many offenders
      should go unpunished?

  - Optimal amount of enforcement depends on cost of catching and
    convicting offenders, nature of punishments, responses of offenders
    to changes in enforcement

  - Approx \$21B, or 4% of reported national income, account for the
    economic costs of crime

  - Optimal decisions are decisions that minimize social loss in income
    from effenses

    - Loss = damages + costs of apprehension and conviction + costs of
      carrying out the punishment

    - Conserve resources

    - Compensate society

    - Punish offenders

Law"]{.underline}

1.  Major function of criminal law in a capitalist society is to prevent
    people from bypassing the system of voluntary, compensated exchange
    (the "market"). Market bypassing in such situations is inefficient
    (in terms of wealth maximization).

2.  Much of this market bypassing cannot be deterred by tort law
    (privately enforced damage suits). The optimal damages that would be
    required for deterrence would so frequently exceed the offender\'s
    ability to pay that public enforcement and nonmonetary sanctions
    such as imprisonment are required.

3.  Such sanctions are extremely costly for a variety of reasons, and
    this, together with the socially worthless character of most of the
    sanctioned conduct, has a number of implications for efficient
    criminal law doctrine, such as that unsuccessful attempts should be
    punished in order to economize on costlier punishments for completed
    crimes.

    a.  Thus, the main differences between substantive criminal law and
        substantive tort law can be derived from the differences in (1)
        the social costs of criminal and tort sanctions and (2) the
        social benefits of the underlying conduct regulated by these two
        bodies of law.

    b.  Most of the distinctive doctrines of the criminal law can be
        explained as if the objective of that law were to promote
        economic efficiency.

## Insanity

*M'Naghten*: first legal test for criminal insanity.

- Cognition: "that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and \... that
  to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly
  proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party
  accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of
  the mind, as not to know **[the nature and quality of the
  act]{.underline}** he was doing; OR if he did know it, that he did not
  **[know]{.underline}** he was doing what was **[wrong]{.underline}**."

  - In other words: defendant presumed sane unless proven otherwise

  - High standard because there is no volition prong, only cognition
    prong. MPC is friendlier to defendants.

Responses to *M'Naghten*

- Some believed it was too focused on cognition (knowing) and not on
  whether they could control themselves. Even if a defendant knew that
  what they were doing was wrong, maybe they couldn't help it (too
  narrow)

- Irresistible impulse: if teh defendant is unable to adhere to doing
  the right thing as a result of irresistible impulse

  - An inability to adhere does not exist unless the act is committed
    under an irresistible impulse which completely deprives the
    defendant of the power of choice or volition (high bar)

- *Durham* test: the defendant's conduct was the product of mental
  disease or defect.

- *Davis* test: person incapable of distinction between right and wrong,
  or unconscious at the time of the act, or though conscious and able to
  distinguish between right and wrong his will has been otherwise than
  voluntarily so completely destroyed that his actions are not subject
  to it but are beyond his control.

***Blake v. U.S.* (5th Cir) → overruled by *Lyons***

- **Facts**: Blake was convicted of bank robbery. He presented evidence
  showing that he required psychiatric treatment for at least 20 years.
  Expert testimony said he was had severe schizophrenia, which often
  manifested in psychotic episodes.

- **Issue**: whether the jury instruction should have used the MPC
  standard or Davis?

- **Reasoning**: Court considers Davis standard (see previous slide)
  (under which defendant could not prevail) & MPC (under which he might)

- **Holding**: A substantial lack of capacity standard (to appreciate
  wrongfulness or conform to law) is called for in light of current
  knowledge regarding mental illness. (MPC Standard)

***U.S v. Lyons* (5th Cir)**

- **Facts**: Defendant was indicted for drug possession. "He also
  offered to present expert witnesses who would testify that his drug
  addiction affected his brain both physiologically and psychologically
  and that as a result he lacked substantial capacity to conform his
  conduct to the requirements of the law."

- **Issue**: Which insanity standard should be used?

- **Holding**: "Reexamining the Blake standard today, we conclude that
  the volitional prong of the insanity defense -- a lack of capacity to
  conform one\'s conduct to the requirements of the law -- does not
  comport with current medical and scientific knowledge, which has
  retreated from its earlier, sanguine expectations. Consequently, we
  now hold that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct on the
  grounds of insanity only if at the time of that conduct, as a result
  of a mental disease or defect, he is unable to appreciate the
  wrongfulness of that conduct."

- **Dissent**: An adjudication of guilt is a judgement of moral
  blameworthiness. Even if science cannot determine the issue of
  capacity to conform conduct, courts must nonetheless try in order to
  avoid imposing liability on a defendant who is not morally
  responsible.

***Kahler v. Kansas***

- **Facts:** Defendant was charged with murdering 4 members of his
  family. The defense argued insanity. Evidence & expert testimony on
  both sides corroborated the insanity defense. The jury convicted and
  recommended death. In 1995, Kansas modified its insanity-defense
  statute. The revised Kansas law provided that a criminal defendant
  could offer evidence of mental illness to show that he did not have
  the required criminal intent, or mental state, to commit the charged
  crime. Thus, the Kansas law recognized a lack of cognitive capacity
  regarding the nature and quality of a defendant's conduct (i.e., a
  person did not know what he was doing when he committed a crime) as a
  valid insanity defense. However, the Kansas law provided that mental
  illness was not otherwise a defense to criminal liability. In other
  words, a lack of moral capacity, or an understanding that a person's
  conduct was wrong (i.e., a person did not know right from wrong when
  he committed a crime), was not a valid insanity defense under Kansas
  law. Yet, at sentencing, a defendant could offer evidence that showed
  that his mental illness made him unable to understand the moral
  wrongness or criminality of his conduct as a reason to lessen his
  punishment.

- **Issue:** Under KS law, a jury can only consider mental disease or
  defect as a defense insofar as it shows that the defendant lacked the
  mens rea required as an element to the crime (M'Naghten abrogated).

- **Holding:** Due process doesn't require states adopt an insanity
  defense that turns on a defendant's ability to recognize the moral
  wrongfulness of the criminal conduct.

- **Takeaway**: SCOTUS won't adopt one version of the insanity defense
  over others; the states can choose.

- Conform conduct = volitional prong.

- Lacks substantial capacity = cognition prong.

- Considers both understanding and willfulness/control

  - Does criminality mean moral wrongness or criminal wrongness? States
    differ

- Burden of proof: most states put the burden on defendant
  (preponderance of the evidence)

- Criticism of MPC approach after Hinckley; many jurisdictions went back
  to M'Naghten

  - Federal Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984 - M'Naghten type focused
    on **cognition**

  - "It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal
    statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting
    the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease
    or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the
    wrongfulness of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not
    otherwise constitute a defense."

## Attempt (MPC 5.01)

***People v. Rizzo***

- **Facts:** Charles Rizzo and three others planned to rob Charles Rao
  of a \$1,200 payroll. Rizzo was to identify Rao while the others would
  carry out the robbery. Armed with guns, they searched for Rao in town
  and at locations linked to his payroll pickup. Police suspicion led to
  a chase, during which Rizzo fled into a building, resulting in the
  arrest of all four men. Rao was never found, and no one with a payroll
  was located at the searched locations.

- **Issue:** Can a defendant be convicted of attempt if they haven\'t
  performed an act so close to completing the crime that it would likely
  have happened without interference?

- **Holding:** No. Attempt requires an intentional act so near to the
  crime\'s completion that it would probably succeed if not for
  interference. Merely preparing for a crime isn\'t enough; the act must
  have a \"dangerous proximity\" to success.

- **Takeaway:** Intent alone isn\'t sufficient for an attempt
  conviction; the act must be close to completing the crime. In this
  case, despite intent, the defendants\' actions were too remote from
  the crime to support an attempt conviction.

***McQuirter v. State***

- **Facts:** Mrs. Allen, a white woman, walked home with her children
  when McQuirter, a black man, made unintelligible remarks and followed
  her. McQuirter later stated he intended to assault and possibly rape
  the first woman he encountered. He followed Allen to the end of a
  street, leaned against a stop sign, then returned to his truck after
  about 30 minutes. McQuirter denied any harmful intent, claiming he was
  searching for a colleague.

- **Issue:** Is intent a matter for the jury to determine based on trial
  evidence, including social conditions and customs influenced by racial
  differences?

- **Holding:** Yes. Intent for the crime of attempt to commit assault
  with intent to rape is a jury determination. Jury must be convinced
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to engage in
  non-consensual intercourse through force or fear. Social factors,
  including racial differences between the defendant and victim, can be
  considered. (Tip: Recall Foucault). Sufficient evidence existed to
  submit McQuirter\'s guilt to the jury, so his conviction was affirmed.

|         | the crime, although the crime is not committed or          |
|         | attempted by such other person.                            |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(4\) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. When the actor\'s  |
|         | conduct would otherwise constitute an attempt under        |
|         | Subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c) of this Section, it is an      |
|         | affirmative defense that he abandoned his effort to commit |
|         | the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under     |
|         | circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary         |
|         | renunciation of his criminal purpose. The establishment of |
|         | such defense does not, however, affect the liability of an |
|         | accomplice who did not join in such abandonment or         |
|         | prevention. Within the meaning of this Article,            |
|         | renunciation of criminal purpose is not voluntary if it is |
|         | motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances, not      |
|         | present or apparent at the inception of the actor\'s       |
|         | course of conduct, which increase the probability of       |
|         | detection or apprehension or which make more difficult the |
|         | accomplishment of the criminal purpose. Renunciation is    |
|         | not complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone  |
|         | the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to  |
|         | transfer the criminal effort to another but similar        |
|         | objective or victim. \[Affirmative defense of              |

***Smallwood v. State* (1970)**

- **Facts:** D, HIV-positive rapist, did not use condoms in any of his
  attacks, exposing his victims to risk of HIV infection and resulting
  risk of death by AIDS. The prosecution analogized the defendant
  carrying HIV to carrying a deadly weapon and deploying it through
  unprotected sex.

- **Issue:** May he be prosecuted for attempted murder if he lacked
  specific intent to kill?

- **Holding:** D should not be convicted for attempted murder b/c he did
  not have a specific intent to kill (no mens rea). Ds raping women
  w/knowledge that he was HIV positive does NOT constitute specific
  intent to kill b/c magnitude of risk of death is not certain enough
  (prob of death by AIDS \< prob of death by gun). Probability only
  reaches to reckless homicide.

- **Rule:** An intent to kill may be permissibly inferred by the trier
  of fact if the defendant's natural and probable acts, conduct, and
  words directly led to the death of the victim. An attempt requires a
  purpose ("specific intent") to produce the proscribed result, even
  when recklessness or some lesser mens rea would suffice for conviction
  of the completed offense.

***State v. Gladstone***

- **Facts:** Thompson, a police agent, tried to buy marijuana from
  Gladstone but was directed to Kent instead. Gladstone provided
  Thompson with Kent\'s address and a map to his residence.Thompson
  successfully bought marijuana from Kent, but there was no evidence of
  communication between Gladstone and Kent.

- **Issue:** Does mere communication suggesting another might commit a
  crime amount to aiding and abetting if the crime is committed?

- **Holding:** No. To be guilty of aiding and abetting, one must
  associate with the criminal venture and actively contribute to its
  success. There must be evidence of counseling , encouragement, hiring,
  commanding, inducing, or procuring the crime. In this case, there was
  no communication or action by Gladstone to assist Kent in selling
  marijuana to Thompson. Therefore, Gladstone's conviction for aiding
  and abetting was reversed.

***State v. McVay***

- **Facts:** McVay, captain of the steamer ship Mackinac, and Grant, the
  ship\'s engineer, were aware that the boiler producing steam was
  unsafe but continued the voyage from Pawtucket to Newport. The boiler
  exploded during the voyage, resulting in the deaths of three
  passengers. Kelley was charged as an accessory before the fact for
  aiding and abetting McVay and Grant in causing the deaths.

- **Issue**: Can an individual be charged as an accessory before the
  fact to manslaughter, even if manslaughter is sudden and
  unpremeditated?

- **Holding**: YES! While manslaughter is often sudden and
  unpremeditated, it can also result from gross negligence. A person who
  aids and abets another in such gross negligence \[mens rea\] can be
  guilty as an accessory before the fact. In this case, Kelley
  intentionally directed and counseled the grossly negligent act that
  led to the deaths.The negligent act was choosing to create steam
  beyond the boiler\'s safe capacity, which McVay and Grant knowingly
  pursued. Kelley\'s actions, if proven true, show reckless and willful
  advising, counseling, and commanding, leading to the deaths. So,
  Kelley can be charged as an accessory before the fact to manslaughter.

***Commonwealth v. Roebuck***

- **Facts:** Roebuck and others lured a man into an apartment complex,
  where they ambushed and shot him, resulting in his death. While
  Roebuck helped plan the ambush, he did not directly shoot the victim.
  Roebuck was convicted of third-degree murder as an accomplice.

- **Issue:** Can a defendant be convicted as an accomplice to
  third-degree murder?

- **Holding:** YES! Accomplice liability is based on aiding the
  principal actor with the required mental state, not necessarily the
  result of the principal act. Thus, Roebuck\'s conviction as an
  accomplice to third-degree murder is affirmed. The culpability
  requirement for accomplice liability may differ from that of the
  principal actor. It is sufficient for a defendant to act with the
  culpable mental state required of the principal actor and
  intentionally aid in the commission of the crime. \[IT DOESN\'T MATTER
  IF DEF. DID NOT INTEND RESULT!\] Third-degree murder, often involving
  unintentional killing, requires recklessness, which is not tied to the
  result but to the defendant\'s conduct. Roebuck\'s reckless conduct
  and aid to the principal actor in the murder satisfy the criteria for
  accomplice liability.

***People v. Luparello***

- **Facts**: Luparello enlisted friends to locate his former girlfriend
  \"at any cost\" from Mark Martin. Armed with weapons, the friends
  lured Martin outside, and one of them shot and killed him. Luparello
  was charged with murder under an aiding-and-abetting theory.

- **Issue:** Can a defendant only be found guilty as an aider and
  abettor or co-conspirator of a crime he intended to facilitate or
  encourage?

- **Holding:** No. While the perpetrator must manifest the required
  intent, an aider and abettor can be held equally liable based on
  accomplice liability. Accomplice liability requires intentional
  encouragement, assistance, or influence in the illegal act. Liability
  extends to the actual crime committed, not just the planned or
  intended crime, based on the principle that aiders and abettors are
  responsible for foreseeable criminal harms. Luparello could be found
  guilty of first-degree murder under an aiding-and-abetting theory, as
  he intentionally encouraged, assisted, or influenced the illegal act.
  The trial court properly instructed the jury, and Luparello\'s
  conviction was affirmed.

|         | \(2\) Scope of Conspiratorial Relationship. If a person    |
|         | guilty of conspiracy, as defined by Subsection (1) of this |
|         | Section, knows that a person with whom he conspires to     |
|         | commit a crime has conspired with another person or        |
|         | persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of          |
|         | conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or   |
|         | not he knows their identity, to commit such crime.         |

|         | \(3\) Conspiracy With Multiple Criminal Objectives. If a   |
|         | person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is       |
|         | guilty of only one conspiracy so long                      |
|         |                                                            |
|         | as such multiple crimes are the object of the same         |
|         | agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.       |

|         | \(5\) Overt Act. No person may be convicted of conspiracy  |
|         | to commit a crime, other than a felony of the first or     |
|         | second degree, unless an overt act in pursuance of such    |
|         | conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him  |
|         | or by a person with whom he conspired.                     |
|         |                                                            |
|         | \(6\) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. It is an           |
|         | affirmative defense that the actor, after conspiring to    |
|         | commit a crime, thwarted the success of the conspiracy,    |
|         | under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary   |
|         | renunciation of his criminal purpose.                      |
|         |                                                            |

|         | (a) conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which     |
|         |     terminates when the crime or crimes which are its      |
|         |     object are committed or the agreement that they be     |
|         |     committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those   |
|         |     with whom he conspired; and                            |
|         |                                                            |
|         | (b) such abandonment is presumed if neither the defendant  |

***Krulewitch v. U.S.* (1949)**

- **Facts**: Krulewitch and another person were charged with conspiring
  to violate and actually violating the Mann Act, which prohibited
  interstate transportation for prostitution. The government argued that
  the conspiracy continued even after the transportation was completed.
  The continuation of the conspiracy was crucial because statements made
  during the conspiracy could be admitted at trial against all
  co-conspirators.

- **Issue:** Does the conspiracy cease after the purpose or object of
  the conspiracy concludes?

- **Holding:** Yes. After the purpose or object of the conspiracy
  concludes, the conspiracy ceases. The modern crime of conspiracy is
  predominantly mental and requires a meeting of minds and intent to
  commit an act. The conspiracy doctrine, while flexible, poses inherent
  dangers, such as incriminating individuals on the fringe of an offense
  and blurring the line between civil and criminal proceedings. The
  Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury may be compromised, as
  accused conspirators can be tried in any district where any
  co-conspirator committed an act related to the conspiracy. Conspiracy
  should be proved with clear evidence of a meeting of the minds and
  intent to accomplish the object of the conspiracy, rather than relying
  on implied or constructive conspiracy.

***Interstate Circuit v. U.S.* (1939)**

- **Facts**: Interstate Circuit, Inc. (Interstate) and Texas
  Consolidated Theaters (Consolidated) dominated the movie-theater
  market in various Texas cities. They entered agreements with eight
  independent film distributors, specifying terms for showing films in
  their theaters. Interstate\'s manager, O'Donnell, sent letters to the
  distributors, making demands as conditions for showing their films,
  which each distributor agreed to. The trial court found that the
  distributors conspired to take uniform action regarding O'Donnell's
  demands, violating § 1 of the Sherman Act.

- **Issue**: Can an agreement to participate in a conspiracy be inferred
  from the course of conduct of alleged co-conspirators under § 1 of the
  Sherman Act?

- **Holding**: Yes. Direct evidence of co-conspirators\' agreement is
  often unavailable. Under § 1 of the Sherman Act, an agreement to
  participate in a conspiracy can be inferred from the course of
  conduct. Each distributor knew about O'Donnell's demands and that
  other distributors were considering them, creating a motive for
  concerted action. Knowledge of the plan, adherence to it, and
  participation in it are sufficient for an unlawful conspiracy.
  Cooperation among the distributors was essential for the plan\'s
  success, and they knew it would result in a restraint of commerce
  violating the Sherman Act. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed.

***People v. Lauria***

- **Facts**: Lauria\'s telephone answering service was used by three
  known prostitutes for business purposes. A police officer, posing as a
  prostitute, signed up with Lauria\'s service and periodically
  complained about lost calls an messages for \"tricks.\" Lauria
  defended his service, emphasizing it was for taking messages. Lauria
  and the three prostitutes were arrested and charged with conspiracy to
  commit prostitution.

- **Issue**: Must the prosecution show that a supplier of goods or
  services had knowledge of the illegal use and intent to further that
  illegal use to make them a participant in a criminal conspiracy?

- **Holding**: Yes. To establish a conspiracy, the prosecution must show
  an agreement to further an illegal act. Knowledge of another\'s
  criminal activity alone is not enough to constitute a conspiracy.
  Intent to further the illegal activity and a stake in the venture are
  necessary elements. In cases like United States v. Falcone and Direct
  Sales Co. v. United States, mere knowledge of illegal activity did not
  constitute conspiracy without intent and a stake in the venture.
  Intent may be inferred when the supplier has a stake in the illegal
  venture, no legitimate use for the goods or services exists, or the
  sales for illegal use account for a high proportion of the supplier\'s
  total business. Lauria did not have a financial gain from the illegal
  activity, and there was no evidence of unusual volume in his business.
  Without evidence of direct action to further the prostitution
  activities or a special interest in the outcome, Lauria cannot be held
  criminally culpable in the conspiracy. The order dismissing the
  indictment is affirmed.

***Pinkerton v. U.S.***

- **Facts**: Brothers Walter and Daniel Pinkerton were indicted for
  violations of the Internal Revenue Code involving possession,
  transportation, and sale of whiskey. Both were found guilty on
  substantive counts and conspiracy charges, even though only Walter
  committed the substantive offenses. The jury found that Daniel could
  be convicted of Walter\'s substantive offenses if they were done in
  furtherance of the conspiracy, even though Daniel had been in jail
  during some of the time of the substantive offenses.

- **Issue**: Is a defendant who conspires with another person criminally
  liable for all substantive offenses committed by the coconspirator in
  furtherance of the conspiracy, even if the defendant did not know
  about the coconspirator\'s acts and did not assist him in any manner?

- **Holding**: Yes. When individuals conspire to commit illegal acts,
  the criminal intent to commit substantive offenses is achieved,
  regardless of who commits them. The conspiracy continues until a
  coconspirator affirmatively withdraws from it. All coconspirators are
  responsible for acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy until one
  intentionally removes themselves. Daniel, though not directly
  participating in the substantive offenses, was part of the conspiracy
  with Walter. Acts committed by one conspirator in furtherance of the
  conspiracy are attributable to all members. Daniel\'s conviction on
  substantive offenses committed by Walter is upheld as they were done
  in execution of the conspiracy. The judgments of conviction are
  affirmed.

***State v. Bridges***

- **Facts**: Bennie Bridges attended a birthday party where he got into
  an argument and left, promising to return with his \"boys.\" Bridges
  found two acquaintances, Bing and Rolle, and asked them to come back
  to the party with him, which they agreed to. Bing and Rolle retrieved
  guns to intimidate others at the party. Returning to the party, a
  street fight erupted between Bridges and another guest, during which
  Bing and Rolle fired their guns, resulting in a death and injury.
  Bridges was convicted of conspiracy and multiple substantive crimes,
  including murder, but appealed, arguing that specific intent was
  required for conviction of substantive crimes.

- **Issue**: May a coconspirator be held criminally liable for
  substantive crimes occurring during the conspiracy if those crimes are
  reasonably foreseeable as necessary or natural consequences of the
  conspiracy?

- **Holding**: Yes. A coconspirator can be held criminally liable for
  substantive crimes if they are reasonably foreseeable as necessary or
  natural consequences of the conspiracy. The state legislature did not
  change the common law regarding coconspirator liability, indicating an
  intent to impose vicarious criminal liability on coconspirators for
  substantive crimes. While specific intent may be required for certain
  crimes, the analysis depends on a causal connection between the crimes
  and the conspiracy, not on specific intent. The jury instruction
  during trial did not adequately present this standard, but the
  evidence showed that the substantive crimes were a foreseeable
  consequence of the conspiracy. Bridges knew Bing and Rolle had guns to
  intimidate, foreseeing escalation and gunfire during the altercation.
  Therefore, the judgment of the appeals court is affirmed in part and
  reversed in part, remanding the case.

## Course Themes

How Criminal Law Entrenches the Social Order

- Race: Death Penalty, McClesky, race and self defense, sexual assault,
  McQuirter (cites a case that cites a case of slavery)

  - Imagery→ Warren Court: defendant was determinism. Rehnquist:
    individualist, free will

    - Neither framing is good; in service of some purpose (there is
      never absolute truth)

    - Judges should not paint images; they should be as straightforward
      as possible

    - Both have an agenda

- Gender: battered womens, sexual assault, marital rape, if a woman
  killed her husband she was stoned, man was fined

- Class: poor having inadequate defense, "seemingly good" cases like
  Clarissa and Wyatt; criminal law replacing property law to re-enslave
  blacks in the south

Indiv (responsibility denying) v communalism (responsibility affirming)

- Why we punish

  - If communalist

Time framing

- How wide? Unchecked discretion. There is no rule.

Knowledge can be wielded by power, but not inherently.

Interest theory (Lawrence) under the guise of being patriotic or
supporting law enforcement ...

Morality of the existing order: Foucault moralization, morals

- If we want to manipulate people for human capital, "straightening" of
  criminals is more effective than public punishment

Moral flaw of breaking the law (Kant)

Randomization

- Evidence that DP acts as a deterrent, that broken windows works, that
  juvenile offenders will turn into adult offenders, no empirical
  evidence

- Just sentencing randomization

- Random sample

- Empirical data is flawed too. But when we base the CJS on critical
  thinking, when empirics run out, must go to randomization to mitigate
  arbitrariness.

Law and economics tries to make law amoral, but you can't. Do you even
want to make it amoral? When we take away someone's liberty, we do so bc
of moral blameworthiness.

INA:

- Blair was undocumented when convicted.

- Khalil was not convicted of a crime, and was here legally

  - Under what circumstances may someone be detained without a criminal
    charge?

- INA:

  - 8 USC 1227(a)(4)(C)(i): An alien whose presence or activities in the
    US has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious
    or adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is
    deportable.

  - Turns on foreign policy consequences with the Middle East

    - Unconstitutional vagueness/notice (changes every four years! What
      is compelling? Deference)

    - What is the burden for the US government? Probably low

    - What is a compelling foreign policy interest?

    - Arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement (*Morales*)

  - Notice and arbitrary application involved

    - What else is in the statute: Nazi activities, recruitment of child
      soldiers, severe restrictions of religious freedom... and
      political speech?

  - Who is to know what the Secretary of State thinks?

  - "Reasonable ground" is not searching.

    - Exception: shall not be excluded on ENTRY (also applies to
      deportation) because of past, current, or projected future
      beliefs/speech unless (C)(iii) Secretary of State "personally
      determines" that their admission to the US would compromise a
      compelling US foreign policy interest.

  - No fact finding, like there was in trump v hawaii

    - Clear evidence of racial + religious animus; can never be

  - Is he being punished because of his status?

    - Not citizen, but other citizens who were just as involved in
      protests not..

  - Hegemony of US and the construct of a state/citizenship. What does
    it mean to belong to a state? We have an idea of citizenship being
    exclusive but why?

    - Racism. Status symbol. Maintenance of the social order
      (perpetuation of whiteness; Chinese Exclusion Act; Dred Scott

    - Othering of minorities

    - If you can rationalize why these people should be excluded, and
      you rely on media depiction of migrants (dangerous criminal
      freeloader), you have cognitive dissonance (Lawrence)

      - Why do you look at them as an "other"? You just do.

  - Steiker:

    - There are immigrant removal proceedings that probably legitimize
      the process.

    - The more this happens, the more people are accustomed to it, the
      more it is legitimized.

  - Racial: Cover article, law is a crutch that allows people to do what
    they feel is unjust

    - Internal legitimation.

    - External legitimation is more "foucault"

Foucault, *Discipline and Punish*, pp. 3-31

- Graphic story of execution where horses attempt to pull out the
  person's limbs when they are tied to the post, and, after several
  attempts without success, the prisoner is cut up

- Punishment has become a hidden part of the penal process

  - Leaves the domain of everyday perception and enters abstract
    consciousness

  - Viewed as inevitable, and therefore effective

  - Apportioning of blame is redistributed

- Modern executions attempt to remove spectacle and eliminate pain

  - "Less cruelty, less pain, more kindness, more respect, more
    'humanity'"

  - Less about physical violence and more about getting to the soul of
    the wrongdoer

- In the 19th century, punishment was a form of discipline to correct
  people

- In modern time, punishment we see an increase in POC being
  incarcerated and a system of mass incarceration

  - Society uses discretion in who to punish as a way to shape society

- Shows two different models of punishment: one is punishing the body
  and the other is about discipline, with regimented schedules of
  prayer, reading, writing, exercise, work, etc.

  - Move from punishing the body to punishing the soul

  - The judge is not just punishing the crime. It becomes a punishment
    system with many punishers who are punishing the person if they are
    a bad person. There is an element of enforcing social order

Foucault, *Discipline and Punish*, pp. 32-47

- 1670 ordinance declared a hierarchy of penalties

  - Death

  - Judicial torture pending proof

  - Penal servitude

  - Flogging

  - Amende honorable

  - Banishment

  - \*note that there were other punishments such as being hanged,
    beheaded, having limbs broken, etc\*

- Penal investigation was intended to produce truth in the absence of
  the accused. A confession was the ultimate truth and took priority
  over any other type of evidence

  - Penal investigation blurred the line between interrogation and
    punishment

  - The function of public torture was to reveal the truth

  - Public execution was understood as a political ritual by which power
    is manifested

Foucault, *Discipline and Punish*, pp. 73-82

- In the 18th century, there were protests against public executions

  - Even the worst murderers have humanity

- Throughout the 18th century, a change in the operation of economic
  pressures, rise in the standard of living, and large demographic
  expansion with increase in wealth and property all contributed to a
  change in crimes and punishment

  - Crime became less violent

  - Shifted from "criminality of blood to criminality of fraud"

- There were numerous loopholes in the penal justice system

  - Result of different customs and procedures, internal conflicts of
    responsibility, private interests (political or economic) which each
    authority found itself defending, and/or the interventions of the
    royal power

  - Too much power in lower jurisdictions, which could carry out
    arbitrary sentences without adequate supervision

  - Too much power for prosecutors, which had almost unlimited means of
    investigation

- Reform movement was intended to establish a new right to punish based
  on more equitable principles

  - New economy of power to punish

  - Prepared for the most part within the legal machinery by its
    representatives

Harcourt, "Post-Modern Meditations on Punishment: On the Limits of
Reason and the Virtues of Randomization (A Polemic and Manifesto for the
Twenty-First Century)," Journal of Social Research Vol. 74(2): 307-346
(2007)

- Proposes abandoning the "misguided attitude of modernity"

- It is difficult to research the effects of deterrence separate from
  the effects of incapacitation

- Crime and punishment should be left to randomization for searches,
  surveillance, and detection. Resources should be allocated by chance.
  Prison sentences should be given at random within an appropriate
  range, and prisoners should be assigned to prisons at random within
  designated escape-risk or security-level categories

## HOW CRIMINAL LAW ENTRENCHES THE SOCIAL ORDER

- Compared to other areas of the law, criminal law is uniquely moral
  (i.e., murder, rape are inherently bad -- Kant).

- But the criminal law is not objective; it fundamentally shapes and
  reinforces the social order in the US

  - Guilt and innocence are naturalized in our society

- Criminal law has served to intenrech and replicate modes of oppression

  - DuBois: criminal law was used to re-establish the racial order in
    Reconstruction south; criminal law replaced property law to
    re-enslave blacks in south; new form of servitude

- \[DISCIPLINE AND PUNISH\] "Certainly the "crimes and offenses" on
  which judgment is passed are juridicial objects defined by the code,
  but judgement is also passed on the passions, instincts, anomalies,
  infirmities, maladjustments, effects of environment or heredity; acts
  of aggression are punished, so also, through then, is aggressivity;
  rape, but at the same time perversions; murders, but also drives and
  desires" (Foucault, p. 17)

- \[ID, EGO\] "According to one theory, domination occurs when the
  ruling class gains the consent of the dominated classes through a
  system of ideas that reinforces the morality or inevitability of the
  existing order. This "interest theory" sees ideology as a consciously
  wielded weapon, and intellectual tool that a group uses to enhance its
  political power by institutionalizing a particular view of reality."
  (Lawrence, 326).

- Criminal law operates under an adar to push morality and politics into
  the law in a hidden way -- so **must be finely attuned to the way
  "criminal law naturalies crime." We think of guilt from certain crimes
  as natural.**

  - But what ends up being considered legitimate uses of force (SYG) or
    what is considered consent to sex (marital rape exception) or what
    is considered the legitimate use of law enforcement force
    (non-indictment of Breonna Taylor's killers) shows the prescription
    in general terms may be of time immemorial -- but not their
    interpretation and application. We don't see the ways criminal law
    is used to engaged in political and social action.

- The criminal law is the most powerful device for social and moral
  condemnation; therefore, punishment needs to be understood as social
  structures.

- There is a power of norms that control behavior -- criminal law
  creates these

  - These beliefs "are not experienced as explicit lessons. Instead,
    they seem part of an individual's rational ordering of her
    perceptions of the world." (Id, Ego)

  - Harcourt on Foucault: "Foucault demonstrates how deeply and
    seamlessly judgment is woven into the fabric of culture, in domains
    we never would have imagined: how, in realms apparently so distant
    from the public sphere of politics -- our private bedrooms and
    closets -- cultural norms are woven into our daily lived experience
    and shape our deepest subjective reality; how they pervade our
    consciousness and experience of life; how they shape our very
    epistemology --the way we see and understand the world, distinguish
    between science and opinion, make claims to truth; and how much work
    and social practice it takes to make these cultural ways of being
    natural and invisible throughout our lived experience... morality
    does not exist in people's heads; it is inscribed in power
    relations, and only the modification of these power relations can
    bring about the modification of morality.

    - Application: what is adequate provocation? Answers are influenced
      by patriarchy, monogamy, etc.

  - Crime has come to be defined as a moral wrong. We used to punish
    people for their acts. Now we punish people for who they are --
    framing crime as a moral failure of the criminal keeps people from
    questioning and criticizing the penitentiary system and the larger
    CJS.

- Legitimation:

  - Steiker: SC's 8th Amendment jurisprudence, originally promoted by
    self-consciously abolitionist litigators and advanced by reformist
    members of the Court, not only has failed to meet its purported goal
    of rationalizing the imposition of the death penalty, but also may
    have helped to stabilize and entrench the practice of capital
    punishment in the US.

    - 'False aura of science to the moral task of deciding life or
      death"

    - People feel less ultimate responsibility, knowing that they are
      only the first step in a lengthy chain of review.

  - Internal legitimation: law is a crutch that allows people to do what
    they feel is unjust (see Robert Cover on abolitionist judges
    applying the Fugitive Slave Act)

    - Actors within the system - lawyers, judges, juries

  - Particular external legitimation: complexity of the system makes the
    public more comfortable with the death penalty than they would
    otherwise be

    - Steiker: "The public develops a strong but false sense that many
      levels of safeguards protect against unjust or arbitrary
      executions. They are thus likely to accept any executions that
      finally make it through the system as being more than fair enough.

  - General external legitimation: DP legitimates the use of physical
    force by the state, thus legitimizing state power generally.

    - Procedure creates an "ideology of justice" that disguises class
      interest of the law and encourages public to hold false or
      exaggerated beliefs in the fairness of the social system.

  - Court's approach to DP is a "house built by warning architects" --
    internal dynamics, as centrists, lacking a vision of their own, have
    been pulled in opposite directions of two minority absolutist wings
    without choosing either

- Social hierarchies: there is a line from slavery → Jim Crow → carceral
  society

  - Slavery → convict leasing → mass incarceration

  - Lyniching → capital punishment

  - "The criminal law and its enforcement are primarily instruments of
    social ordering predominantly deployed to keep African Americans and
    other persons of color in a condition of second-class citizenship.

    - Enabled by "reasonableness" and other standards that give jury
      discretion. Even when you ban explicit racial language, defense
      lawyers can use code works, which trigger certain perceptions and
      judgments)

- "We must rid ourselves of the illusion that punishment is above all
  (if not exclusively) a means of reducing crime" (Discipline and
  Punish, 24)

  - Punishment reflects who we are as a society. Punishment practices
    need to be understood as social structures, reflecting social values
    and racial/economic hierarchies.

  - Movement of punishment of the body (barbaric) → punishing soul
    (punishing better)

  - Not just crime control, but controlling people throughout society in
    an orthopedic fashion, making them docile.

  - Harms defined by the criminal system reflect what the dominant group
    in society believes to be good for society.

    - The very measure of "an evenhanded" way is inflected by the
      normative structure of the existing social and racial order

    - Ex: Theft is bad because we live in a capitalist society and it
      takes wealth from those who have it.

- Reform?

  - Reform is a "distraction" from abolition. It rests on unstable
    foundations; the perception of harm and violence associated with
    criminality is determined by race, gender, class, and other
    relations of power in society. It is not possible to talk about the
    harms caused by crime in a vacuum. The "harms caused by crime are
    artifacts of the present social condition and racial conditions"

  - You cannot extract systematic racism from a system

- Punishment as a reflection of society and its hierarchies

  - Serne footnote from Edward Coke: "if a man accidentally shoots
    another while hunting and trespassing on another's land, that is
    felony murder. If a man accidentally shoots another while hunting on
    his own land, that is just an accident"

    - What renders you a criminal is whether you are a property owner.

  - Even homicide -- in Napoleonic code, one of the "worst" forms of
    homicide is patricide (killing one's father)

- Provocation:

  - Sudden discovery of adultery allows murder to be mitigated to
    adultery. Reinforces patriarchy -- almost always a husband killing
    his wife

  - "Provoked by his allegedly nagging, belligerent and sadistic
    wife..." (*Carroll*)

- Manslaughter:

  - Native American couple fails to take sick child to doctor for fear
    that government will wrongly assume negligence and the child away →
    kid dies and couple is convicted manslaughter

    - Indian child removal was a big thing at the time

    - Court notes the race and lack of education of the defendants --
      seems like it was the reason the child died in the first place and
      possibly the reason they were found guilty of manslaughter.

- Sentencing guidelines

  - Risk scores determine different levels of punishment in some
    jurisdictions, which maps onto socioeconomic, racial categories
    (i.e., more points for unemployment or for lack of education past
    9th grade)

- Punishment

  - Vitiello: "In Puritan America, the law was used to advance the
    dominant religious beliefs and to enforce \"proper standards of
    moral behavior.\" Based on the Calvinist belief in the innate
    depravity of human beings, the criminal law served to keep people
    from temptation." (CB, 122-123)

  - "Quaker views contrasted sharply with the Puritan conception of the
    criminal law. Early in our history, the Quakers led a movement away
    from capital and corporal punishment to a system of workhouses and
    prisons. Viewed as grim in retrospect, that system was generally
    enlightened by comparison to earlier treatment of criminals. At
    root, it was based on an optimism about human capacity for
    transformation. Like proponents of the medical model, Quakers
    believed that crime was the product of society, rather than a result
    of inherent sinfulness. But the method chosen for transformation was
    not \"treatment.\" Instead, they believed that the offender could be
    reformed through a process of rationality. Freed from the corrupting
    influences and permitted to reflect on moral questions, the offender
    could be \"restored to fellowship with God and humanity.'"

- Self Defense

  - The legal standard legitimates Goetz's racially-motivated killing
    because it allows the jury to act on the racially-biased views
    they've imbued from society (e.g., racially-biased crime stats). In
    their eyes, the youths had attempted to rob Goetz (despite no
    conclusive evidence of that) and his violence was justified as
    vigilantism. Of course, if the races were flipped, the outcome would
    have been different. Although official standards (e.g.,
    "reasonableness") are meant to exclude racial bias, they fail to do
    so in practice.

- Rape:

  - When it was a capital crime, it was usually imposed only on black
    men accused of raping white women

  - Now, "black men may still be at an exceptionally high risk of unjust
    conviction and disproportionate punishment, while black women --
    even more than other rape victims -- may have exceptional difficulty
    getting effective protection from police, prosecutors, and juries"

- Language: Often Empty Terms We Fill

  - Malice

    - "The definition of murder is unlawful homicide with malice
      aforethought. And the words malice aforethought are technical. You
      must not, therefore, construe them or suppose that they can be
      construed by ordinary rules of language. The words have to be
      construed according to a long series of decided cases, which have
      given them meanings different from those which might be supposed."
      (Serné)

    - The term "malice" in common law is a container that doesn't mean
      anything itself, but that we fill with whatever precedential law
      we make. It's the same thing for any legal term (e.g., negligence,
      recklessness, purpose). Every legal term we use lacks an ordinary
      language meaning, doesn't come with a correct concept. It's a
      technical vehicle to create law.

    - What we do when we're interpreting and arguing cases is
      effectively trying to fill the container, the technical term, with
      whatever moral, political, social forces that we think are going
      to be to the advantage of our client.

    - Thus, there is no relationship between language and the object
      described.

  - Proximate

    - 'Proximate cause' ... is, in a sense, artificial, serving matters
      of policy surrounding tort and criminal law and based partly on
      expediency and partly on concerns of fairness and justice."
