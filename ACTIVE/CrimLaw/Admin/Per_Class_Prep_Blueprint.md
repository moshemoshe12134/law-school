# Per‑Class Prep Blueprint (Spring 2026 — Harcourt Crim Law)

This is the “what to generate” checklist for each class when you’re not doing the reading yourself.

**Deliverables per class (always):**
1. `Lectures/Prep/Audio/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_audio_prep.md`
2. `Lectures/Prep/Reference/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_class_reference.md`

**Canonical assignment input (always):** `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN.md`

**Primary priors (use by default):**
- `Admin/Sources/Past_Outlines/Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md` (broad coverage; great structure)
- `Admin/Sources/Past_Outlines/Criminal Law_Spring 2023_Harcourt_Exam Outline - Tanisha Gupta.docx.md` (exam moves + Harcourt-specific tips)
- `Admin/Sources/Past_Outlines/Crim Policy Notes.docx.md` (policy/theory hooks)
- `Admin/Sources/Past_Outlines/MPC Supplement.docx.md` (clean MPC text blocks)

---

## Module map (how Harcourt tends to teach)

### Module 1 — Elements + Homicide (Classes 1–8)
**Class goal:** learn Harcourt’s “MPC close reading” posture + build homicide framework.
- Audio: stories + distinctions + cold-call Qs (don’t drown in details).
- Reference: MPC parsing + case hooks + hypo triggers (this becomes your doctrine bank).

### Module 2 — Process, punishment, constitutional limits, capital punishment, sex assault, morality (Classes 9–18)
**Class goal:** theory/policy synthesis and constitutional constraints; doctrine is often the vehicle.
- Audio: thesis + 2 strongest arguments each side + what Harcourt will attack.
- Reference: argument matrices + “if he asks X, answer Y” + policy essay starters.
- **Important**: many “Supp.” items are not stored locally; add PDFs/texts or the system must flag gaps.

### Module 3 — Justifications/excuses + expanding liability (Classes 19–26)
**Class goal:** apply MPC defenses + statutory interpretation to high-stakes fact patterns (race/police/self-defense etc).
- Audio: “moves” (objective vs subjective; burdens; reasonableness; MPC structure).
- Reference: element-by-element frameworks + prosecution/defense scripts + mini hypo bank.
