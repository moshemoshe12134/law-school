# Prep Packet — Class #{class_number} — {date} — {title}

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)
- By the end of prep, I can: (1) parse the assigned MPC text into elements; (2) state the policy thesis of the supplement; (3) answer a cold-call with a clean rule + application + counterargument.

## 1) Assignment Snapshot
- Syllabus extract: `{inputs.syllabus_assignment}`
- Reading triage (Harcourt):
  - `MPC`: must read closely (word-by-word)
  - `Supp/policy/theory`: must read (capture thesis + arguments)
  - `Cases`: skim to extract hypo-able facts + doctrinal hooks

## 2) MPC Parsing Sheet (primary)
> One subsection per assigned MPC section (or the most relevant sections if the assignment is indirect).

### MPC § ___
- Provision text (verbatim):
-
- Defined terms / cross-references (e.g., §1.13, §2.02, etc.):
-
- Elements (numbered):
  1.
  2.
- Mens rea attachment (where does it apply?):
-
- Interpretive moves Harcourt might make (syntax, canons, structure, punctuation):
-
- Ambiguities / line-drawing (best arguments both ways):
-
- Quick hypo trigger(s):
-

## 3) Policy / Theory Brief (co-primary; ~50% exam)
> Goal: 1-page “policy essay starter” you could use on an exam.

- Central thesis (1 sentence):
-
- 3 supporting claims (bullets):
  - 
  - 
  - 
- 2 key quotes (copy/paste, with page or location if available):
  - 
  - 
- How this policy frame changes doctrine/application (2–4 bullets):
  - 
  - 
- Likely Harcourt questions (Socratic prompts):
  - 
  - 

## 4) Minimal Case Cards (tertiary)
> Only for cases likely to be discussed / used as hypos; focus on “how the facts drive the MPC/policy analysis.”

### Case: ___
- Facts (30 seconds):
-
- Holding / rule nugget (1–2 sentences):
-
- MPC hook (what language does this implicate?):
-
- Policy hook (what value conflict does this raise?):
-
- One exam-style hypo (1–2 sentences):
-

## 5) Cold Call / Co‑Counsel Script (2 minutes)
> A script you can actually say under pressure.

- Definition / framing sentence:
-
- Elements walk-through (very short):
-
- Apply to facts (top 2 facts):
-
- Counterargument:
-
- Policy kicker (tie to supplement):
-

## 6) Predictions (explicit + falsifiable)
- Likely covered in class:
  - 
- Likely skipped:
  - 
- Likely cold-call targets:
  - 
- Likely policy debate:
  - 
- Likely exam angle / “what he wants you to learn”:
  - 

## 7) TA / Office Hours Questions (if any)
-
