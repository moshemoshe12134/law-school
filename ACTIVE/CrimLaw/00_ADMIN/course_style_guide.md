# Criminal Law Course Style Guide

**Purpose:** Course-specific writing standards, preferences, and conventions for CrimLaw (Harcourt, Spring 2026).

---

## Course Overview

**Professor:** Harcourt
**Semester:** Spring 2026
**Exam Format:** Issue-spotters + policy essay, open book

**Course Characteristics:**
- **MPC close reading** - Syntax, structure, defined terms, element breakdown
- **Policy/theory emphasis** - Expect ~50% policy on exam
- **Critical theory** - Foucault, Balkin, abolitionist critiques
- **Cases as vehicles** - For hypos, not always exam-central

---

## Course Priorities

### Doctrinal Focus

**Primary emphasis:**
1. **MPC provisions** - Verbatim text, close reading of syntax/structure
2. **Element breakdown** - How elements attach to mens rea, what satisfies each
3. **Statutory interpretation** - How professor parses MPC language

**Secondary emphasis:**
- Cases (as vehicles for doctrinal moves, not always exam-central)
- Policy/theory supplements (~50% exam weight)
- Critical theory (Foucault, Balkin, abolitionism)

**Exam weight:**
- Issue-spotters: ~50% (doctrinal analysis)
- Policy essay: ~50% (theory/critique)

---

### Policy Weight

**Policy in class:** Heavy - Professor rewards policy arguments and theoretical critiques

**Policy on exam:** ~50% of exam points - One or more policy essays

**Expected depth:**
- Understand major policy tensions (retribution vs. utilitarianism, abolition vs. reform)
- Apply critical theory frameworks (Foucault's discipline, Balkin's dyads)
- Use professor's preferred scholars and arguments

**Key policy themes:**
- Punishment theory (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation)
- Critical legal studies (indeterminacy, legal manipulation)
- Abolition (anti-carceral critiques)
- Race and criminal law (McCleskey, disproportionality)

---

### Case Depth

**Case briefing expectations:** Medium - Not every case needs full brief

**What to brief:**
- Cases that establish major rules (Martin, Decina, State v. Robinson)
- Cases professor spends time on in class
- Cases with unique holdings or important dissents

**What to skip:**
- Cases that merely illustrate established rules
- Cases mentioned only in passing

**Dissent focus:** Important when:
- Dissent articulates policy position professor favors
- Dissent shows alternative doctrinal approach
- Professor mentions dissent in class

---

## Harcourt Classroom Mechanics (Observed)

Based on the Class 1–2 transcripts, prep needs to match how Harcourt actually runs the room:

- **Code-first and read-aloud:** He calls on students to open the MPC appendix and read provisions out loud (then parses single words).
- **Definitions as weapons:** He jumps to MPC definitions that are adjacent or cross‑referenced (e.g., “conduct”) and uses them to re-parse the statute mid-class.
- **Elements are tactical:** He treats “conduct / attendant circumstance / result” as lawyer tools; he asks which classification helps the prosecution vs. defense.
- **Role-play is routine:** He assigns roles (“you’re the prosecutor/defense”) and demands arguments in-role, including concessions and pivots.
- **Time-framing is a core move:** He expects you to generate both narrow and broad descriptions of “the act” and defend each as a plausible opinion.

## Prep Document Preferences

### Audio Prep Style

**Purpose:** TTS-friendly, conversational prep for listening before class

**Length:** 4,000-5,000 words (~25-30 minutes at 1.5x)

**Voice:**
- Conversational, but direct (short paragraphs; occasional contractions)
- Second person (“have this ready”; “be able to say …”)
- Light signposting (“First/Next/Bottom line”), not self-referential framing
- Concrete predictions about Harcourt’s moves: code reading, definition drilling, prosecution/defense roles, time-framing
- Prioritize what you need to say out loud in class

**Content principles:**
- **Include:** Core concepts explained conversationally, stories, key cases (facts + holding + why it matters), cold-call prep, connections to previous/future classes
- **Exclude:** Verbatim MPC text (save for text prep), detailed case briefs (save for text prep), extensive footnote-style citations

**Conversation techniques:**
- Lead with the doctrinal hook (one sentence), then the application (two sentences)
- Give a prosecution version and a defense version for the same question
- Name the exact word/phrase Harcourt will press on in the code or case

---

### Text Prep Style

**Purpose:** Comprehensive reference for in-class lookup

**Format:** Q&A format with expected questions and complete answers

**Required sections:**
- QUICK NAVIGATION
- BOOK NAVIGATION (KSSB pages + MPC appendix targets)
- CORE DOCTRINE (MPC text, element breakdown)
- DEFINITIONS TO HAVE READY (MPC + ordinary meaning where relevant)
- EXPECTED HARCOURT QUESTIONS (Q→A format)
- CASE BRIEFS (using standard format)
- POLICY/THEORY (thesis, arguments, exam-ready paragraphs)
- QUICK HYPOS (≥5 with both-side arguments)
- SEARCH TERMS

**Case brief format:**
```markdown
## Case Name, [Citation] ([Year])

### Rule of Law
[One-sentence rule]

### Facts + Procedural Posture
1. [Key fact 1]
2. [Key fact 2]
3. [Procedural history]

### Issue
1. [Primary question]

### Holding & Reasoning
### ([Justice], J.)
[Yes/No]

1. [First point]
2. [Second point]
   * Sub-point

### Disposition
[Affirmed/Reversed/remanded]
```

**What to emphasize:**
- **MPC text verbatim** - Include exact statutory language
- **Cross-referenced MPC definitions** - Include definitions Harcourt will grab mid-class when they control parsing
- **Element attachment** - How mens rea attaches to each element
- **Prosecution vs. defense postures** - For each hard question, write both sides’ best element-by-element arguments
- **Kelman/Balkin moves** - Time-framing, dyads, indeterminacy
- **Policy tensions** - Competing values, professor's framing

**Hypo format:**
- Facts (1-2 sentences)
- Issue (legal question)
- Both-side arguments (prosecution + defense)
- Most likely Harcourt push

---

## Exam Answer Style

### IRAC Structure

**I - Issue**
- Frame as: "Whether [defendant] can [claim/defense] under [doctrine]"
- Include jurisdictional facts if relevant

**R - Rule**
- Complete rule statements with all elements numbered
- Include MPC citations (e.g., MPC § 2.01(1))
- Define key terms on first use
- Cite major cases (case name + holding in one sentence)

**A - Analysis**
- Apply each element sequentially
- Use "Here, [facts]... because [reasoning]"
- Consider counterarguments
- Distinguish adverse authority
- **For CrimLaw:** Discuss alternative time-frames (Kelman), both sides of policy debates (Balkin dyads)

**C - Conclusion**
- Direct answer: "Therefore, [defendant] CAN/CANNOT [claim/defense]"
- Follow logically from analysis

---

### Writing Style

**DO:**
- Use MPC section numbers (e.g., "Under MPC § 2.01...")
- Cite case names (e.g., "As held in Martin...")
- Include policy analysis in issue-spotters
- Use professor's conceptual language (indeterminacy, discipline, time-framing)
- Discuss both doctrinal and policy sides

**DON'T:**
- Cite cases by name only (include holding)
- Ignore policy tensions (even in doctrinal questions)
- Use statutory text without close reading (parse syntax, structure)
- Miss opportunity to discuss critical theory (when relevant)

---

### Formatting

- Use numbered lists for elements
- Use bold for key terms and holdings
- Use `Code font` for MPC sections
- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Include headings for each major element

---

## Professor Patterns

### Typical Questions

**Socratic style:**
- Cold calls on specific students
- Follow-ups: "But what if..." "How does that change..." "Is that always true..."
- Pushes on policy implications
- Connects current doctrine to broader themes

**Patterns:**
- Puts you in a role (“prosecutor” or “defense”) and asks for your best argument in that role
- Asks you to find and read an MPC definition, then reclassify elements using it
- "What's the time-frame here?" (Kelman move)
- "Who wins under the MPC?" (statutory interpretation)
- "What's the policy argument for X?" (Balkin dyads)
- "How does this relate to [previous topic]?" (thematic connections)

---

### What Gets Rewarded

**Analysis moves:**
- MPC close reading (syntax, structure, defined terms)
- Kelman time-framing (broad vs. narrow time-frames)
- Balkin dyads (generate both sides of policy debate)
- Policy sophistication (critical theory, abolitionist critiques)
- Thematic connections (race, class, power)

**Scholarly references:**
- Kelman (time-framing)
- Balkin (dyads)
- Foucault (discipline, prison)
- Harcourt (randomization, critique)

---

### Exam Signals

**Phrases professor uses:**
- "This is the single most important..."
- "You need to understand this cold"
- "This will be on the exam"
- "Note this distinction"

**Patterns:**
- Spends 20+ minutes on one case → likely exam-heavy
- Repeats concept across multiple classes → recurring theme
- Connects to past exam explicitly → "This is like 2018 exam Q1"
- Uses hypothetical repeatedly → testable fact pattern

---

## Course-Specific Conventions

### Statutory Citation Style

**MPC citations:**
- First mention: "MPC § 2.01(1)"
- Subsequent: "§ 2.01(1)" or "§ 2.01"
- Always include subsection when relevant

**Quoting MPC:**
- Include verbatim text in text prep
- Reference in audio prep (not full text)
- Parse syntax carefully (brackets, commas, "or" vs. "and")

---

### Case Name Format

**Full citation first:** *Martin v. State*, 228 So. 2d 25 (Ala. Ct. App. 1950)

**Short form thereafter:** Martin

**Dissents:** Include if notable or professor discussed

---

### Numbering and Formatting

**Elements:** Always number: 1, 2, 3...

**Tests:** Number factors: (1), (2), (3)...

**Rules:** Use bold for emphasis: ** voluntary act**

**Policy paragraphs:** Use blockquotes (> text) for exam-ready paragraphs

---

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include in Prep Docs

**Doctrine:**
- MPC text verbatim (in text prep)
- Element breakdown with definitions
- Adjacent MPC definitions that control parsing (conduct, omission, material element, etc.; e.g., on Actus Reus day include MPC § 1.13(4)–(5) alongside the assigned provisions)
- How mens rea attaches to each element
- Common traps and ambiguities

**Cases:**
- Facts (2-3 sentences max)
- Holdings (one sentence)
- Why case exists (what doctrine/hypo it illustrates)
- Exam trigger facts
- Statute text when available as primary law (and, at minimum, the exact operative phrases + page anchors)
- Element map showing which side wants which classification (conduct vs. attendant circumstance vs. result)

**Policy:**
- Thesis (what the argument is about)
- Competing positions (2-3 major approaches)
- Exam-ready paragraphs for each position
- Professor's preferred arguments

**Hypos:**
- 5+ hypos per class (in text prep)
- Both-side arguments
- "Most likely Harcourt move"
- A one-paragraph prosecution script and defense script for at least the 2–3 hardest hypos

---

### What to Exclude

**From audio prep:**
- Verbatim MPC text
- Detailed case briefs
- Extensive footnotes
- Dense policy paragraphs

**From text prep:**
- Conversational filler
- Stories without doctrinal point
- Missing sources (flag explicitly: "Supplement not available")

---

```

---

## Key Course Themes

### MPC Close Reading

**What it is:** Parsing statutory language for doctrinal moves

**How Harcourt uses it:**
- "What's the time-frame here?" (Kelman)
- "Who counts as the killer?" (agency theory)
- "Does 'knowingly' attach to element 1 or 2?" (mens rea distribution)

**Your prep should:**
- Include verbatim MPC text
- Note ambiguous language
- Anticipate interpretive moves

---

### Kelman Time-Framing

**Core concept:** Same facts can be criminal or not depending on where you draw time boundaries

**Examples:**
- **Broad framing:** Decina driving knowing he has epilepsy → voluntary act
- **Narrow framing:** Epileptic seizure itself → involuntary act

**When to use:**
- Actus reus (voluntary act)
- Causation (but-for vs. proximate)
- Omissions (when did duty arise?)

---

### Balkin Dyads

**Core concept:** Generate both sides of policy debate quickly

**Structure:**
- Position A + strongest argument
- Position B + strongest argument
- Reconciliation (if applicable)

**When to use:**
- Policy essays
- Issue-spotter policy sections
- Cold-call prep on policy topics
