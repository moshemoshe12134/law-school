# CrimLaw Exam Strategy Analysis

**Created:** 2026-01-24
**Purpose:** Reverse-engineer what earns A+ grades on Harcourt's Criminal Law exam.
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Executive Summary (Update as analysis progresses)

### The Core Problem You Identified

You made the classic 1L mistake: studying the *subject* instead of studying the *exam*.

- You can "speak" about the law well, but you didn't write what the professor rewards.
- You made points YOU found worthy, missed points professor rewards as "magic words."
- You focused on cases/doctrine, not on Harcourt's specific analytical frameworks.

### The Solution (Preview — details below)

Harcourt's exam is **NOT a conventional issue-spotter**. It's a test of:

1. **Whether you can apply our specific classroom discussions** to new facts
2. **Whether you can connect cases/doctrine to Harcourt's theoretical themes**
3. **Whether you absorbed Foucault and the critical theory lens**

The model answers that earn A+ grades share specific patterns. This document catalogs them.

## Part 1: Exam Format Analysis

### Recent Format (2024-2025)

| Feature    | 2025                                                | 2024                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Format     | 3 hours, open-book, proctored                       | 3 hours, open-book, remote              |
| Questions  | 2 (50% each)                                        | 2 (50% each)                            |
| Word limit | 3,000 total (1,500/question)                        | 2,500 total (1,250/question)            |
| Q1 type    | Legal memo analyzing novel fact pattern             | Research memo on constitutional issues  |
| Q2 type    | Reflective essay on crystalline structures (Balkin) | Foucault essay linking to course themes |

### Key Observations:

1. **This is NOT a standard MPC element-by-element issue-spotter.** Q1 uses MPC/doctrine but as a vehicle for showing you understood *how we discussed it in class*.
2. **Questions explicitly reference "our classroom discussions."** The 2024 exam says: "use the specific framework of our classroom discussions" (3 times). The 2025 memo says: "It is unlikely that any investigation will lead to criminal prosecution" — the answer requires knowing the limits, not just the elements.
3. **Half the exam is theory/reflection.** Q2 is always a Foucault/Balkin/Kelman critical theory essay. You cannot cram this.

## Part 2: What the Professor's Memo Reveals (2025)

Harcourt provided a memo for Q1 2025 that is effectively a model answer. **This is gold.** Key patterns:

### 2025 Q1 Memo Structure:

1. **Lead with the bottom line:** "It is unlikely that the investigation will lead to criminal charges."
2. **Identify THE threshold issue:** "But for" causation is the main obstacle.
3. **Explain why the obvious answer is wrong:** Parents have duty of care (omission liability satisfied), but causation fails because vaccine is only 97% effective.
4. **Discuss what you'd need for other charges:** Recklessness requires subjective awareness (need more facts).
5. **Analogize to cases we discussed:** State v. Williams as close comparison — but distinguish it.
6. **Discuss policy implications:** Deterrent effect of criminal prosecutions against parents.
7. **Note what you're NOT discussing:** Free exercise (not studied), endangerment (not studied).

### Magic Words and Doctrinal Points from 2025 Memo:

- "But for" causation — **the threshold issue the professor wanted flagged**
- 97% vaccine effectiveness → reasonable doubt problem
- Duty of care arises under four circumstances (cite Shirley Greene case)
- Civil negligence vs. criminal negligence standard
- Recklessness requires "subjective awareness of substantial risk"
- Williams comparison: similar (omission liability for parent), different (not refusing known treatment)
- "This would entail policy questions about the deterrent effect"

### What the Professor DIDN'T Want:

- Discussion of RFK Jr. or ministers (no duty of care, so don't discuss)
- Constitutional free exercise arguments (not studied)
- Endangerment charges (not studied)
- Extended moralizing about anti-vaxxers

**Takeaway:** The answer is SHORTER than you'd expect. It's about identifying the RIGHT issues, not listing ALL issues.

## Part 3: Model Answer Patterns (2024)

### Q1 Model Answers — Common Structures:

**Answer A pattern:**

1. State thesis upfront: "The best argument for defendants is that sleeping outside is essentially involuntary."
2. Walk through Robinson, Powell, Morales — *as we discussed in class*
3. List multiple possible interpretations from each case
4. Apply each interpretation to facts
5. Make both sides' arguments
6. End with evaluation of who wins

**Answer C pattern:**

1. List the specific numbered interpretations from Robinson (5 different ones)
2. Show Morales had TWO bases (one got 6 votes, one got minority)
3. Apply the interpretations that got 6+ votes as stronger arguments
4. Use time-framing (cite Balkin/Kelman) on voluntariness
5. Acknowledge constitutional uncertainty post-Dobbs

**Magic phrases that appear across multiple model answers:**

- "In class we discussed several different reasonings behind the decision"
- "As we discussed in class" / "In our classroom discussions"
- "Several possible interpretations"
- "Broader time-frame (per Balkin/Kelman)"
- Specific vote counts from cases (e.g., "only the former received six votes")
- "Involuntary" as the key distinction
- "Status crime" language

### Q2 Model Answers — Common Structures:

All Q2 answers follow the template Harcourt provided:

1. Epigraph (Foucault passage, 3-8 lines)
2. Thesis paragraph explaining passage + previewing 3 themes
3. Section on what the passage means
4. Three subsections, each on a "theme" connected to cases/doctrine
5. Conclusion with "biggest insight" and further questions

**Themes that earned high marks:**

- Power-knowledge relationship
- Legitimation / "double system" of justice
- Voluntary acquiescence to social order (Antilochus)
- Interpretive constructs (time-framing, Kelman, Balkin)
- Race, statistics, discrimination (McCleskey, Baldus study)
- Rehabilitation as false comfort
- Crystalline structures (individualism vs. communalism dyads)

**Magic moves in Q2:**

- Connect Foucault passage to 3+ specific cases from class
- Use Antilochus as bookend reference (we started and ended with it)
- Reference specific class discussions ("In our very first class...")
- Show personal growth/changed thinking ("2 months ago I would have said...")
- Connect CrimLaw themes to other 1L courses (Torts, ConLaw)
- Cite specific page numbers from Foucault

## Part 4: What A+ Answers Do That B+ Answers Don't

### A+ answers:

1. **Reference classroom discussions explicitly** — not just the readings
2. **Use Harcourt's specific analytical frameworks** — time-framing, crystalline structures, Antilochus
3. **Show the multiple interpretations** of cases we discussed (not just "the holding")
4. **Make arguments for BOTH sides** — then evaluate
5. **Connect theory to doctrine** — Foucault/Balkin aren't separate from MPC analysis
6. **Keep to word limit** — direct, economical prose
7. **Signal what they're NOT discussing** — shows judgment about relevance

### B+ answers likely:

1. List all possible issues (shotgun approach)
2. Heavy MPC element analysis without classroom discussion framing
3. Skip the theory question or treat it as afterthought
4. Miss the specific interpretations we discussed
5. Moralize instead of analyze
6. Exceed word limit with padding

## Part 5: The A+ Preparation Strategy

### Phase 1: Reframe Your Study (Weeks 1-8)

**Stop doing:**

- Reading cases to "learn the law"
- Memorizing MPC sections
- Making traditional outlines organized by topic

**Start doing:**

- Taking notes on "how Harcourt discussed X case" — what interpretations did he emphasize?
- Building a "Classroom Discussion Log" organized by case/concept → multiple interpretations
- Tracking Foucault passages that connect to doctrine
- Tracking Balkin crystalline structures → which cases illustrate them?

### Phase 2: Build Exam-Specific Materials (Weeks 9-12)

Create these documents:

1. **Interpretive Constructs Bank**

   - For each major case: 3-5 possible interpretations we discussed
   - Note which interpretation got majority vs. minority votes
   - Note how time-framing applies
2. **Foucault Passage Bank**

   - 10-15 key passages (3-8 lines each)
   - For each: 3 themes it connects to
   - For each theme: 2-3 cases/doctrines that illustrate it
3. **Crystalline Structures Quick Reference**

   - Individualism vs. Communalism dyads
   - For each doctrine: which side is prosecution? defense?
4. **Magic Words Checklist**

   - Terms/phrases that appear in model answers
   - Organized by topic

### Phase 3: Practice Exams (Weeks 13-14)

1. **Do timed practice exams** — use 2023, 2021, 2019
2. **Compare to model answers** — what did you miss?
3. **Practice the essay template** — especially Q2 structure
4. **Practice the memo format** — for Q1

prompt:

reflect on /Users/mosheklein/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-mosheklein.mk@gmail.com/My Drive/1. law-school/ACTIVE/CrimLaw/00_ADMIN/EXAM_A+_STRATEGY_WORKBOOK.md

and
/Users/mosheklein/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-mosheklein.mk@gmail.com/My Drive/1. law-school/ACTIVE/CrimLaw/00_ADMIN/EXAM_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md

next, read carefully the 3 transcipts i have so far from this years lectuers./Users/mosheklein/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-mosheklein.mk@gmail.com/My Drive/1. law-school/ACTIVE/CrimLaw/03_TRANSCRIPTS/raw

and based on this, create a new doc that will contain your reflections on how best to prepare for class each day.

my goal is to spend the least amount of time reading and especailly least amount of time preparing for class.

i want to 90% be preparing for the exam.

this means we need to rewrite the instructions we currently have for Agents which control how we 1. prep for class and 2. review class transcripts.

the goal is for me to enter class having the HIGHEST value info that will arm me for class discussion (so far, the most useful thing for class was simply having the past year outline on hand. the prep docs prepared by ai have been only somewhat useful. i dont think they are quite there yet. the current prep routine does not know what the professor tends to focus on and where the class discussions go.

i noticed so far that professor seems ot delve into the statute in question, as well as pushing for ways to support the prosecution as well as the defense in a back and forth.but im running off of just 3 classes. i've noticed that currently ai is not partiucalrly good at predicting what professor will ask. we need to fix this by studying the transcirpts well and figuring out what he does actually ask.

and then for after class i need the ideal workflow which will encapsulate allt he calss discussions and professors remarks into the ideal format for me to review and prepare for exam- which is was most what i want to be focused on.

in sum, of all things, my primary objective is

1: to predict precisely what professor will want a model answer to write on the 2026 exam, and i want to come into the exam armed with those paragraphs as much as possible. to know precisely how to structure the answer and what points to make and how. gleaned from past model answers and this years class lecture/disussions.

2: it will be nice if i dont embarees myself in class such that if he is to ask me a question ('what does the statute say' or whatever other questions he tends to ask) that i have something to say.
