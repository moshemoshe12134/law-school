# CrimLaw A+ Exam Strategy Workbook

**Created:** 2026-01-24
**Purpose:** Reverse-engineer Harcourt's exam expectations from past exams and model answers to develop a precise A+ strategy.

**Core Problem to Solve:**
- Too much time on case learning, not enough on exam performance
- Knew the law but couldn't package it into exam-ready answers  
- Missed "magic words" and doctrinal points the professor rewards
- Made points I found worthy but professor didn't value
- Missed points I thought were obvious/silly but professor rewarded

## Model Answer Structure Patterns

### Issue-Spotter (Q1) Structure — THE CRITICAL PATTERN

**Opening: Jump Straight to the Heart of the Matter**

From 2018 Memo: "This case is all about the justification for law enforcement use of lethal force under §3.07 and §3.09... The discussion should start there. There is no reason to think that a reasonable prosecutor would start anywhere higher than the justification defense."

From 2019 Memo: "You should jump right into the justification issues, after quickly suggesting that for the homicide... the initial level of homicide could easily be first or second degree murder, or 3. There is no need to spend much time on this initial question of mens rea, it is easy and the real issue is self-defense."

**🚨 CRITICAL INSIGHT: Don't waste words on obvious elements. Identify THE REAL ISSUE and go there immediately.**

**Structure That Earns Points:**

1. **One-sentence identification of central issue** (e.g., "This case is all about §3.04 and §3.09")
2. **Quick stipulation of obvious elements** (actus reus, basic mens rea) — 1-2 sentences max
3. **Deep dive into THE contested issue** — this is where 80% of your analysis goes
4. **Prosecution arguments** with specific MPC citations
5. **Defense arguments** with specific MPC citations
6. **Conclusion with recommended outcome**

**Model Answer Format (from high-scoring answers):**

```
[Defendant Name]

[Charge]: [One-sentence framing]

Prosecution: [Specific argument with MPC cite]
Defense: [Specific argument with MPC cite]
Response: [Counter-argument]
Conclusion: [Recommended outcome]
```

### Policy Essay (Q2) Structure

**What Earns Points:**
- Reference SPECIFIC readings by author name (Kelman, Foucault, Steiker, Cover, Lawrence)
- Apply theory to SPECIFIC doctrine (not abstract hand-waving)
- Show evolution/change in legal doctrine as evidence of theory
- Use cases from class as examples

**High-Scoring Structure:**
1. State the theoretical framework clearly
2. Apply to 2-3 specific doctrinal areas with case citations
3. Show how theory illuminates something non-obvious
4. Connect to current issues (mass incarceration, racial disparities)
5. Take a position — don't just describe

### Reflective Essay (Q3) Structure

**What Earns Points:**
- Genuine personal reflection, not generic platitudes
- Reference to specific guest speakers, cases, or class moments
- Connection between theory and future practice
- Critical engagement (not just agreement with everything)

## Magic Words & Doctrinal Phrases

### MPC Section Numbers — ALWAYS CITE THESE

**Homicide:**
- §210.1 (criminal homicide defined)
- §210.2 (murder — know the subsections: (1)(a) purpose/knowledge, (1)(b) reckless + extreme indifference)
- §210.3 (manslaughter — (1)(a) reckless, (1)(b) EED)
- §210.4 (negligent homicide)

**Justification — THE MOST TESTED AREA:**
- §3.04 (self-defense) — cite SPECIFIC subsections:
  - §3.04.012(2) — deadly force justified if actor "BELIEVES" necessary
  - §3.04.041 — provocation/aggressor limits
  - §3.04.08 — forcible felony exclusion
- §3.05 (defense of others)
- §3.07 (law enforcement use of force)
- **§3.09 — THE MAGIC SECTION** — limits on justification for negligent/reckless belief formation

**Attempt:**
- §5.01 — "substantial step strongly corroborative"
- §5.01(1)(b) — attempt requires PURPOSE (not recklessness)

**Complicity:**
- §2.06 — accomplice liability
- §2.06(3)(a) — with purpose of facilitating

**Culpability:**
- §2.02 — the hierarchy (purpose, knowledge, recklessness, negligence)
- §2.02(3) — culpability requirement for material elements

### Analytical Phrases That Signal Competence

**From Model Answers:**
- "The real issue is..." (shows you know what matters)
- "Assuming arguendo..." (shows you can bracket issues)
- "Under a narrow/broad time frame (Kelman)..." (shows theory knowledge)
- "A reasonable jury could find..." (shows evidentiary standards)
- "The prosecution will argue... The defense will counter..." (shows adversarial thinking)
- "The subjective/objective standard here..." (shows doctrinal precision)
- "This was a gross deviation from the standard of conduct..." (MPC language for recklessness)
- "Consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk..." (recklessness definition)

### Phrases from High-Scoring Answers

| Phrase | Context | Why It Works |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| "This case is all about..." | Opening | Shows issue-spotting |
| "There is no need to spend much time on..." | Dismissing obvious elements | Shows efficiency |
| "The heart of the matter is..." | Focusing analysis | Shows prioritization |
| "Under MPC § [X.XX]..." | Every legal claim | Shows doctrinal precision |
| "A person of reasonable firmness in that situation..." | Duress analysis | MPC language |
| "Reckless in having such a belief..." | §3.09 analysis | Magic phrase for imperfect self-defense |

## Point-Earning Patterns

### Points Harcourt ALWAYS Rewards

1. **§3.09 Analysis for Justification Cases**
   - From 2018 Memo: The ENTIRE analysis often comes down to §3.09
   - Was belief formed recklessly or negligently?
   - This is where the grade is made or lost

2. **Distinguishing Recklessness from Negligence**
   - From 2018 Memo: "I don't believe the prosecution will charge manslaughter here, because I think it will be extremely difficult to prove and convict based upon a recklessness mens rea. Here, however, negligence is a possibility."
   - Shows you understand the difference matters

3. **Acknowledging What You CAN'T Prove**
   - Good answers say "The prosecution cannot establish..." when appropriate
   - Shows realistic prosecutorial judgment

4. **Attempt Requires Purpose**
   - From 2019 Memo: "The central question is whether there can be an attempted manslaughter under the MPC: does the MPC provision on attempt allow a charge where the mens rea is recklessness or negligence? Under MPC § 5.01(1)(b) requires purpose."
   - This is a favorite Harcourt point

5. **Time-Framing (Kelman)**
   - Referenced in almost every model answer
   - Narrow vs. broad time frame for actus reus
   - Always mention when voluntariness is at issue

6. **Policy Context**
   - From 2018 Memo: "the court will need to take into consideration the context of police shootings today and the racial dynamics at play"
   - Harcourt rewards awareness of systemic issues

### Points That Get Ignored (Don't Waste Time)

1. **Obvious Causation** — Unless genuinely contested, one sentence max
2. **Basic Actus Reus** — Unless involuntariness is the issue
3. **EED/Insanity When Not Implicated** — From 2019 Memo: "this case does not raise EED or insanity, so do not waste any time on those"
4. **Extended Discussion of Obvious Mens Rea** — If someone shoots with intent, don't belabor it

### Surprising Point-Earners

1. **Acknowledging Imperfect Self-Defense as a MIDDLE Ground**
   - Not just guilty/not-guilty but what level of culpability survives
   
2. **Differentiating Defendants**
   - From 2018 Memo: "in terms of differentiating defendants, you could argue that officer David, who only fired once, was less negligent"
   
3. **Immunity Provisions**
   - From 2019 Memo: Discussion of §3.04.032 immunity from prosecution
   
4. **Constitutional Context**
   - 8th Amendment issues for death penalty
   - Due process for insanity defense

## Common Student Mistakes

### From Memos to Students

**2018 Memo — What Students Did Wrong:**
> "Note that this case does not involve the 'extreme emotional disturbance' excuse in §210.20; it probably does not trigger conspiracy or complicity for the officers who did not shoot; nor any other possible creative provision in the code, so no need to discuss necessity separately, or self-defense separately, etc. No need to discuss causation really, nor voluntariness. Those are all just a waste of the judge's time."

**Translation: Students wasted words on irrelevant issues instead of going deep on the real issue (§3.07/§3.09)**

**2019 Memo — What the Right Answer Does:**
> "You should jump right into the justification issues... There is no need to spend much time on this initial question of mens rea, it is easy and the real issue is self-defense."

**Translation: Don't clear your throat. Get to the point.**

### Patterns in Lower-Scoring Answers (Inferred)

1. **Kitchen-sink approach** — Discussing every possible doctrine
2. **Failing to take a position** — "It could go either way" without recommendation
3. **Ignoring the ROLE assigned** — Not writing as prosecutor/defense/judge
4. **Generic policy discussion** — Not tied to specific doctrine
5. **Missing §3.09** — The killer mistake in justification cases

## Professor's Memos Analysis

### 2019 Memo Key Points

**The Case:** Shooting in self-defense (Bryan Thomas)

**What Harcourt Wanted:**
1. Jump to §3.04/§3.09 immediately
2. Analyze exceptions: forcible felony (§3.04.08), aggressor (§3.04.041), reckless belief formation (§3.09)
3. Note that attempt requires purpose (§5.01)
4. Don't waste time on EED/insanity

**Quote:** "The real issue is self-defense under 3.04 and 3.09. That should be the major part of your discussion, up front and mostly about justification."

### 2018 Memo Key Points

**The Case:** Police shooting (Vassell)

**What Harcourt Wanted:**
1. Start with §3.07 and §3.09 — nowhere else
2. Only charges possible: criminally negligent homicide OR second-degree manslaughter
3. Discuss police practices and racial dynamics
4. Don't discuss EED, conspiracy, complicity for non-shooters, necessity, causation, voluntariness

**Quote:** "Any reasonable prosecutor will be deciding whether to go for reckless homicide (second degree manslaughter) or criminally negligent homicide—or not to proceed. So there really is not reason to start discussions anywhere else than at the heart of the matter."

### Recurring Themes Across All Memos

1. **§3.09 is THE key section** — It's the bridge between justification and culpability
2. **Know when charges are impossible** — Not every fact pattern supports every charge
3. **Prosecution thinks strategically** — Charge what you can prove, not what you wish
4. **Time-framing matters** — But Harcourt wants it applied, not just mentioned
5. **Policy context is expected** — Racial dynamics, police practices, systemic issues
6. **Don't waste words** — Every sentence should earn points

## Raw Notes & Observations

### Session 1: 2026-01-24

**Key Discovery: The §3.09 Pattern**

In EVERY justification case (2018, 2019, 2020, 2023), the winning analysis centers on §3.09. This section asks whether the actor was reckless or negligent in FORMING their belief about the need for force. 

This is the "imperfect self-defense" bridge: even if you have a subjective belief, if that belief was formed recklessly → manslaughter. If formed negligently → negligent homicide.

Students who miss §3.09 are missing the entire game.

**Key Discovery: Harcourt Tells You What to Skip**

The memos explicitly say "don't waste time" on certain topics. This means students ARE wasting time on them. The A+ strategy is ruthless efficiency: know what NOT to discuss.

**Key Discovery: The Opening Sentence Pattern**

Model answers don't clear their throat. They say "This case is all about X" in the first sentence. This shows you've spotted the issue. It saves words. It earns immediate credibility.

**Key Discovery: Policy Essays Need Names**

Every high-scoring policy essay drops theorist names: Kelman, Foucault, Cover, Lawrence, Steiker & Steiker, Bryan Stevenson. These are the "magic words" for Q2.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create §3.09 practice problems
2. Build MPC section flashcards
3. Practice the opening-sentence pattern
