# Exam Spec (Harcourt Criminal Law)

This file is a living "exam contract" extracted from past exams + anything Harcourt says in class/TA.

## Sources
- Past exams: `Exams/Past_Exams/`
  - 2006 Spring Exam.pdf (analyzed below)

## Format Snapshot
- **Time limit**: 4 hours
- **Open/closed book**: Open-book, take-home
- **Allowed materials**: Any materials, but no collaboration/talking to others
- **Number of questions**: 3 questions
- **Grading**: 1/3 weight on each question (equal weighting)
- **Doctrine vs policy weighting**: Mixed — roughly 33% pure doctrine (issue-spotter), 33% policy essay, 33% reflective/professional development

## Question Types Observed

### 2006 Spring Exam:
1. **Issue-spotter / MPC Application** (Q1): Fact pattern (E2 nightclub stampede) with students acting as prosecutor then public defender, analyzing charges and defenses under MPC. Structured response format provided.

2. **Policy Essay** (Q2): Original essay connecting theories of punishment (Kaplan Ch. 1) with criminal law theory readings (Module II). Must synthesize two bodies of literature with original analysis. Explicitly states "do not paste in summaries" — wants original thinking.

3. **Reflective/Professional Essay** (Q3): About guest speakers (ADM case participants), exploring insights about being a good lawyer/participant in justice system. Tests professional judgment and critical reflection.

## What Gets Rewarded (from 2006 exam instructions)
- **Specifically tailored answers** — "not cut and paste materials from notes"
- **Original thinking** — "original essay with original material that offers an original argument"
- **Organization, structure, argumentation and presentation** — explicitly emphasized
- **Proper citations** when quoting (e.g., "Kaplan 568 or Levitt 239")
- **Clean analysis** — understanding what's relevant vs. "unnecessary or irrelevant background information"
- **Following provided structure** — exam may provide organizational framework

## Practice Checklist
- MPC parsing under time pressure
- Policy argument templates (both sides)
- Clean element-by-element application (prosecution + defense)
- Counterarguments + ambiguity handling
- **Original essay writing** connecting theoretical readings
- **Synthesis across different types of readings** (doctrine + theory + policy)
- **Professional reflection** on justice system participants
- **Concise, tailored responses** (avoiding info-dumping)

## Unknowns / Questions to Resolve Early
- Has exam format changed since 2006? (Still take-home? Still 3 questions?)
- What "Module II readings" will be assigned this year?
- Will there be guest speakers again (like ADM case)?
- Any guidance from TA on current exam expectations?
