# CrimLaw: Exam-First Class Prep Strategy

**Created:** 2026-01-24  
**Purpose:** Redefine daily prep and post-class review to minimize time on "class readiness" and maximize exam preparation.

---

## TL;DR — The Shift

**Before:** Prep docs tried to predict cold calls + teach doctrine comprehensively.  
**Now:** Prep docs arm you with (1) the statute text and (2) prosecution/defense arguments. Post-class reviews extract exactly what Harcourt rewards on exams.

**Time reallocation:**
- Pre-class prep: 15-20 min (down from 30-45)
- Post-class processing: 25-40 min (up from 20-30)
- Weekly exam synthesis: 60 min NEW
- Total time preserved, but 90% now feeds exam prep directly

## Part 1: What 3 Classes Revealed About Harcourt's Teaching

### The Pattern (Observable from Classes 1-3)

| Move | What He Does | Example from Transcripts |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Statute deep-dive** | Reads statute aloud, asks "what are the verbs?" | Martin: "appearing" and "manifesting" parsed word-by-word |
| **Prosecution push** | Calls on student as prosecutor, presses for strongest argument | "He was boisterous. That's voluntary. What's the problem?" |
| **Defense pivot** | Immediately flips: "Defense counsel, respond" | "The appearance was involuntary because he was arrested" |
| **Time-framing** | Invokes Kelman—narrow vs. broad frame | "If you expand the timeframe, he voluntarily drank" |
| **Fish/frog moment** | Points out you can see it BOTH ways—equally compelling | "Were there moments you only saw yellow fish?" |
| **Policy/context** | Ties to larger social stakes (race, power, incarceration) | Class 1: entire lecture on racial disparities in criminal law |
| **MPC comparison** | "What does the MPC say about this?" | "MPC 2.01 only requires *a* voluntary act" |

### Questions Harcourt Actually Asks

**Type 1: "What does the statute say?"**
- He wants you to READ the statute aloud or identify the verbs/elements
- Example: "What are the acts in this codification?" (asked of Eli, Class 2)

**Type 2: "What would prosecution argue?"**
- Wants the STRONGEST prosecution argument, with MPC cite
- Example: "You rest on the boisterousness. That's voluntary. Period." (Class 2)

**Type 3: "Defense counsel, respond"**
- Wants you to identify the voluntariness/mens rea weakness
- Example: "Appearance involuntary because police arrested him" (Rabia, Class 2)

**Type 4: "What does [mens rea term] mean?"**
- Wants translation to MPC categories (purpose/knowledge/recklessness/negligence)
- Example: "What does 'malicious' mean here?" → student must map to recklessness (Class 3)

**Type 5: "How do you distinguish [Case A] from [Case B]?"**
- Wants the critical factual/doctrinal difference
- Not asked yet in Classes 1-3, but expected based on exam format

**Type 6: Time-framing challenge**
- "If you expand the time frame..." or "What if we narrow the frame..."
- Tests whether you see Kelman's point about framing affecting outcome

### What Harcourt Does NOT Do

- ❌ Ask detailed fact-recall questions ("What color was the car?")
- ❌ Ask you to recite case holdings verbatim
- ❌ Quiz on dates, jurisdictions, or procedural history
- ❌ Expect memorized MPC text (you have books open)

## Part 2: New Pre-Class Prep Framework

### Philosophy

**Old approach:** Prepare comprehensive doctrine → predict cold calls → hope to be ready.

**New approach:** Have two things ready:
1. **The statute/rule** — so you can read it aloud if asked
2. **2-3 prosecution + defense arguments** — so you can argue either side

**The past outline is your safety net.** If you get stuck, you search it in class.

### Minimum Viable Prep (10-15 minutes)

**For each class, prepare ONE index card (literal or mental):**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CLASS [NN]: [Topic]                                        │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STATUTE/RULE (verbatim):                                   │
│ [Copy the exact text — MPC section or statute at issue]    │
│                                                            │
│ Key terms to parse:                                        │
│ [Verbs, attendant circumstances, result elements]          │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS:                                     │
│ 1. [Strongest argument + MPC cite]                         │
│ 2. [Time-frame expansion if applicable]                    │
│                                                            │
│ DEFENSE ARGUMENTS:                                         │
│ 1. [Best counter + MPC cite]                               │
│ 2. [Time-frame narrowing if applicable]                    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ POLICY HOOK:                                               │
│ [1 sentence: How does this connect to Harcourt's themes?]  │
│ e.g., "Police power + racialized enforcement"              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Extended Prep (If Time Permits — 20-25 minutes total)

Add:
- **Case distinctions:** 1-2 sentences on how today's case differs from prior cases
- **Kelman time-frame application:** Where could framing change outcome?
- **Past exam connection:** Has this topic been tested? What was the issue?

### What to Skip

- ❌ Detailed case briefs with procedural history
- ❌ Policy "debates" on abstract theory
- ❌ Predictions of every possible question
- ❌ Comprehensive doctrinal summaries (that's what the outline is for)

### Safety Net Setup

**Before each class, have these open on your laptop:**
1. Text prep (searchable)
2. Past outline (2025 Harcourt Full — via INDEX lookup)
3. MPC (back of casebook or PDF)

When cold-called and unsure: CTRL+F the topic → read aloud.

---

## Part 3: New Post-Class Review Framework

### Philosophy

**Old approach:** Summarize what happened in class → compare to prep.

**New approach:** Extract EXACTLY what Harcourt would reward on the exam, formatted for direct insertion into outline/prewrite bank.

**The review document IS exam prep.** Not a diary of class events.

### Review Document Structure (New Template)

```markdown
# Class [NN] Review — [Date]

## 1. STATUTE/RULE AS HARCOURT FRAMED IT

[Copy exact language Harcourt emphasized — he often re-reads statutes in class]

Key parsing:
- [Verb/act elements identified]
- [Attendant circumstances identified]
- [Result elements identified]

---

## 2. ARGUMENTS HARCOURT PUSHED

### Prosecution's best arguments (from class discussion)
1. [Specific argument + MPC cite if given]
2. [Time-frame or other framing argument]

### Defense's best arguments (from class discussion)
1. [Specific argument + MPC cite if given]
2. [Counter to prosecution's strongest point]

### Resolution / Professor's assessment
[Did Harcourt signal which way he leans? Did he indicate "this is a close case" or "this is clearly X"?]

---

## 3. EXAM SIGNALS

### Explicit signals
- [Anything Harcourt said is important, testable, or connected to past exams]

### Implicit signals
- [Topics that got extended time]
- [Hypos Harcourt constructed in class]
- [Phrases Harcourt used that match model answer language]

---

## 4. MAGIC WORDS / PHRASES

[Copy any precise formulations Harcourt used that would sound good in an exam answer]
- "The real issue is..."
- "Consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk..."
- etc.

---

## 5. PREWRITE FRAGMENTS

### Issue-spotter paragraph (draft)
[1 paragraph applying today's rule to a hypo fact pattern, prosecution + defense arguments]

### Policy connection (if tested)
[1 paragraph connecting doctrine to Harcourt's themes: power, race, incarceration, Foucault, Kelman]

---

## 6. OUTLINE INSERTS

[Precise doctrinal statements ready to paste into outline]

- [Rule statement 1]
- [Rule statement 2]
- [Case distinction / holding]

---

## 7. CORRECTIONS TO PREP

[What did prep get wrong? What was missing?]
- [Prep predicted X, but Harcourt emphasized Y]
- [Prep missed Z entirely]
```

---

## Part 4: Weekly Exam Synthesis (NEW — Critical)

### What

Every weekend, spend 60 minutes synthesizing that week's classes into exam-ready materials:

1. **Prewrite bank additions:** Take the prewrite fragments from reviews → polish into full prewrite paragraphs
2. **Outline updates:** Insert the "Outline Inserts" from reviews into your running outline
3. **Prosecution/defense pattern log:** Track which argument types win in Harcourt's framing

### Why

This is where the 90% exam focus happens. Daily reviews extract raw material; weekly synthesis refines it into exam weapons.

### Format

Create/update: `ACTIVE/CrimLaw/06_PREWRITES/PREWRITES_BANK.md`

Each prewrite:
```markdown
## [Doctrine Name] — Issue-Spotter Prewrite

**Trigger:** [When to use this in an exam hypo]

**Prosecution:**
[Argument + MPC cite]

**Defense:**
[Counter-argument + MPC cite]

**Resolution:**
[How to conclude — what tips the balance]

**Magic words:** [phrases to include]
```

---

## Part 5: Revised Agent Instructions

### Pre-Class Prep Instructions

```markdown
## CRIMLAW PRE-CLASS PREP — AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

**Goal:** Produce a 1-page "index card" prep, NOT a comprehensive document.

### REQUIRED OUTPUTS

1. **Statute/Rule Block**
   - Copy the EXACT text of the statute/MPC section at issue
   - Identify: verbs (conduct elements), attendant circumstances, result elements
   - If multiple rules, prioritize the ONE Harcourt will likely focus on

2. **Prosecution Arguments** (2-3 max)
   - What is the STRONGEST prosecution argument?
   - Include MPC citation
   - Consider: time-frame expansion, element-by-element proof

3. **Defense Arguments** (2-3 max)
   - What is the STRONGEST defense counter?
   - Include MPC citation
   - Consider: time-frame narrowing, voluntariness challenges, mens rea gaps

4. **Policy Hook** (1-2 sentences)
   - How does this connect to Harcourt's themes?
   - Themes: power, race, incarceration, Foucault, Kelman time-framing, critical theory

5. **Past Outline Reference**
   - Use INDEX.md to locate this topic in past outlines
   - Include: file name + line numbers for quick lookup in class

### WHAT NOT TO DO

- ❌ Write comprehensive case briefs with full procedural history
- ❌ Predict every possible cold call question
- ❌ Write abstract policy discussions
- ❌ Summarize the entire doctrinal area
- ❌ Create tables/charts for audio (if doing audio prep)

### FORMAT

Keep it SHORT. Target: 500-800 words. The student should be able to read this in 10 minutes.

Structure:
1. Header with class number, date, topic
2. Statute block (box or code block formatting)
3. Prosecution arguments (numbered list)
4. Defense arguments (numbered list)
5. Policy hook (1-2 sentences)
6. Outline reference (file + lines)
```

### Post-Class Review Instructions

```markdown
## CRIMLAW POST-CLASS REVIEW — AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

**Goal:** Extract exam-ready material from transcript. This is NOT a summary of class — it's exam prep extraction.

**Core Philosophy:** For ANY fact pattern, develop a repertoire of PROSECUTOR ARGUMENTS and DEFENSE ARGUMENTS. The exam is about making both sides of the argument credibly.

### 🚨 CRITICAL ACCURACY RULES

1. **ONLY attribute to professor what transcript explicitly shows**
   - Quote or closely paraphrase transcript
   - Never invent professor statements
   - If unclear, mark [TRANSCRIPT_UNCLEAR]

2. **Separate inference from lecture content**
   - Your doctrinal reasoning → "Doctrinal Insight" section
   - What transcript shows → "What Happened" sections

### REQUIRED OUTPUTS

1. **Statute/Rule as Harcourt Framed It**
   - Copy EXACT language if he read it aloud
   - Note how he parsed elements

2. **Arguments Harcourt Endorsed as 'Valid' or 'Arguable'** ⭐ NEW PRIORITY
   - **Prosecution arguments that Harcourt:**
     - Explicitly validated ("That's a good argument")
     - Tacitly endorsed (spent time developing, didn't shut down)
     - Used in hypotheticals without dismissing
   - **Defense arguments that Harcourt:**
     - Explicitly validated ("That's exactly right")
     - Tacitly endorsed (engaged with seriously, built on)
     - Returned to multiple times
   - **Mark arguability level:**
     - ✅ Explicitly endorsed
     - ⚡ Tacitly approved (spent time on, didn't dismiss)
     - ❌ Dismissed or rejected (note why — still useful to know boundaries)
   - **Critical:** Capture BOTH sides for each fact pattern — exam requires arguing both ways

3. **Exam Signals**
   - Explicit: "This is important," references to exams
   - Implicit: Extended time, multiple hypos, energy shifts

4. **Magic Words / Phrases**
   - Verbatim formulations from Harcourt
   - Match to model answer language from past exams

5. **Prewrite Fragments** (CRITICAL)
   - Draft 1 paragraph applying this rule to a hypo
   - **Must include BOTH prosecution and defense arguments**
   - Use only arguments Harcourt validated/engaged with
   - This is the KEY output — it directly becomes exam prep

6. **Outline Inserts**
   - 2-3 precise doctrinal statements ready to paste

7. **Corrections to Prep**
   - What did prep miss?
   - What should future preps emphasize?

### FORMAT

Use the template structure above. Target: 800-1200 words.

Focus on EXTRACTION, not DESCRIPTION. Every sentence should be usable on an exam.

**New Section Required:** "Prosecution vs Defense Argument Pairs" — for each major issue, list the validated arguments on both sides
```

## Appendix: Harcourt's Specific Teaching Patterns (To Update After Each Class)

### Class 2 (2026-01-22): Martin v. State

**Statute parsed:** Alabama Code §120 — "appears" + "manifests"

**Prosecution arguments pushed:**
- Boisterousness was voluntary — that satisfies the act requirement
- MPC 2.01 only requires *a* voluntary act, not all elements voluntary
- Time-frame expansion: he voluntarily drank

**Defense arguments pushed:**
- Appearance was involuntary (arrested, taken outside)
- Possible: drunkenness made boisterousness involuntary

**Harcourt's assessment:** "Fish/frog" — you can see it both ways equally

**Magic words:**
- "What are the verbs in this statute?"
- "The prosecution would say: There's a voluntary act. Period. What's the problem?"
- "Were there moments you only saw yellow fish?"

### Class 3 (2026-01-23): Cunningham + Faulkner

**Statute parsed:** Section 23 Offenses Against Person Act — "unlawfully and maliciously"

**Key move:** Translating "malicious" → MPC mens rea hierarchy

**Judge Oliver (trial):** Malicious = wicked (vague, bad instruction)  
**Professor Kenny:** Malicious = intent OR recklessness  
**Judge Byrne (appeal):** Malicious = foreseeability (≈ recklessness)

**Faulkner move:** Lower court treated as strict liability (if felony + fire, guilty). Appeal requires mens rea for the fire itself.

**Magic words:**
- "What does 'malicious' mean?"
- "Foreseeability — that's pretty similar to recklessness"
- "Negligence: we don't have to enter his mind at all"
