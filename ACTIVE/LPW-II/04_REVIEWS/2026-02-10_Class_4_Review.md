# LPW-II Class 4 Review: February 10, 2026

## Developing the "Theory of the Case" - Riven v. Echocraft

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

This session focused on refining the **"Theory of the Case"** for the *Riven v. Echocraft* brief, bridging the Retaliation and Copyright issues. The group shifted the narrative lens from viewing Riven as a "Vigilante" to an **"Opportunist,"** which better explains both his hostile behavior ("the virus") and his copyright claim. The session also covered administrative details for the upcoming first draft and court observation opportunities.

## 👥 Small Group Discussion (The "Meat")

**Participants:** Jacob (TA/Fellow), Moshe, Neelam, Jeff, and others.

### A. Feedback on Outlines

- **Structure:** Outlines varied significantly (skeletal vs. full paragraphs).
  - *Jacob's Advice:* For the brief, you must balance facts and legal arguments effectively.
- **Case Management:** Create a specific "Case Outline" for oral arguments.
  - Categorize cases as **Neutral**, **Good**, or **Bad**.
  - This allows for quick handling of questions without cluttering the main argument.
- **Formatting Arguments:**
  - Do not feel bound to argue prongs in numerical order (1, 2, 3, 4).
  - **Lead with your strongest prong.**
  - De-emphasize weaker prongs by conceding them or framing them as less relevant.

### B. Theory of the Case (Major Brainstorming)

The core challenge was finding a narrative theme that unites *both* Retaliation and Copyright issues.

**Definition:** A "Theory of the Case" is the unifying implicit message that helps the reader empathize (e.g., "The driver was in a rush," not just "The driver was negligent").

#### Proposed Theories:

1.  **"Parody"** (Your initial suggestion):
    - *Critique:* Dismissed as a legal argument, not a narrative theme.
2.  **"Loyalty/Culture"** (Speaker 6):
    - *Narrative:* Echocraft values deep roots/retention. Riven was a "virus" because he threatened this culture.
    - *Critique:* Hard to prove loyalty isn't just a pretext for discrimination.
3.  **"The Vigilante"** (Your suggestion):
    - *Narrative:* Riven is a misguided "do-gooder" hunting for discrimination using bad methods.
    - *Critique:* Makes him too sympathetic (like Batman).

#### 🏆 The Winning Theory: "The Opportunist"
*Led by Neelam and yourself.*

-   **Narrative:** Riven knew he was going to be fired for underperformance (cyclical trends/style out of vogue). To cushion the blow, he **manufactured** a discrimination claim and a copyright dispute to extort a windfall from the company.
-   **Why it works:**
    -   Explains the "virus" comment: He is sabotaging the company for profit.
    -   Explains the Copyright claim: He is trying to monetize an educational tool.

### C. Specific Legal Arguments

#### Copyright (Fair Use)
-   **The Problem:** Echocraft used approx. 87% of the lyrics (7 out of 8 lines).
-   **The Defense:** Focus on **Purpose** (Parody/Education) rather than **Amount**.
-   **Your Argument:** Riven’s song contains historical facts (dates/events). **You cannot copyright facts.** This mitigates the "amount" used because the creative portion is smaller than it appears.

#### Retaliation
-   **The Defense:** Fired strictly for underperformance. The "virus" comment refers to his toxicity/opportunism, not his gender or protected activity.
