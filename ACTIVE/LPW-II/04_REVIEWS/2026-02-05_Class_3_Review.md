# LPW-II Class 3 Review: February 5, 2026

## The Advocacy Narrative: Developing a Statement of Facts & Theory of the Case

---

## 📌 Class Overview

**Topic:** Theory of the Case + Statement of Facts development
**Professor Vee** led the session; **Jacob Turner** was absent (participating in Moot Court competition on Long Island)
**Clemens Wetcholowsky** (Teaching Fellow) facilitated breakout groups

---

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### 1. Theory of the Case

**Key Principle:** Every component of an appellate brief is an opportunity to persuade.

- Your theory of the case should be a **thread that runs throughout your entire brief**
- Connects: Statement of Facts → Issue 1 → Issue 2 → Conclusion
- Must be consistent across both issues (even if working with a partner)
- **Iterative process:** You'll go back and forth between your argument and statement of facts as you write and edit

> "I think the best writing process is you're gonna go back and forth between your issue argument issue. Going back to your statement of facts, going back to your theory of the case... that does produce at the end of the day, the strongest result and the most convincing case."

### 2. Statement of Facts vs. Legal Memo

| Legal Memo (Objective) | Appellate Brief (Persuasive) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Objective recounting   | Advantageous to client       |
| Neutral presentation   | Persuasive narrative         |
| Just the facts         | Theory-driven selection      |

**Critical Rule:** Any fact referenced in your argument **MUST appear in your Statement of Facts first**. Facts cannot appear for the first time only in your argument section.

> "It cannot appear for the first time and only time in your argument. You have to make sure that it also appeared in your statement of facts."

### 3. Handling Unfavorable Facts

**Do NOT:**

- Be disingenuous or untruthful
- Dismiss or hide unfavorable facts
- Sweep them under the rug

**DO:**

- Address unfavorable facts honestly
- **Neutralize** them through framing
- Present them in a way that minimizes their impact
- Acknowledge them openly, then explain why they don't defeat your position

> "This doesn't mean you don't deal with the less favorable facts for your client. You still have to address those, but addressing it in a way that perhaps you can kind of neutralize it."

### 4. Statement of Facts as Persuasion Tool

Professor Vee's insight from her appellate practice:

- The Statement of Facts is often the **most challenging** part to write
- It's the **most original** part of your brief
- Goal: Write it so persuasively that the reader (judge) is already leaning your way **before** they even read your legal arguments

> "After they read the statement of facts, the reader might already be taking position even before they address the points in your brief."

## 📋 Breakout Session: EchoCraft Group Discussion

### RETALIATION ISSUE (Title VII)

#### EchoCraft's Strongest Arguments:

1. **Performance Issues Pre-Dated Investigation**

   - Riven had documented underperformance **before** the Title VII investigation began
   - Quotas were not being met well before any protected activity
   - At-will employment means termination was lawful if based on legitimate performance concerns
2. **Investigation Was Flawed/Skewed**

   - Riven's statistical analysis was methodologically weak
   - Small sample sizes (sometimes interviewing only 1 person per department)
   - Cherry-picked data to support a predetermined conclusion
   - Some departments showed women earning **higher** bonuses than men
   - No control for years of experience, role, or other factors
3. **Lack of Clear Knowledge of Protected Activity**

   - Sniff's email didn't explicitly mention Title VII or gender discrimination
   - A "reasonable person" wouldn't immediately jump to systemic discrimination from a Christmas party comment about bonuses
   - **Case precedent:** *Clark County* - one remark doesn't create reasonable suspicion of systemic issue
4. **Company's Pro-Women Policies**

   - Strong maternity leave policies
   - Sexual harassment training exists
   - Women in senior leadership positions
   - Frame the company as pro-equality, not misogynistic

#### EchoCraft's Weakest Points (to address):

1. **Ray's Email to Sniff**

   - Ray (CEO) wrote that Riven "seems like a virus to the company"
   - This looks bad - suggests Ray was triggered/threatened by the investigation
   - **Counter:** Argue Ray was concerned about a vendetta, not covering up discrimination
   - Frame as: Employee with personal grudge trying to damage company PR
2. **Scope of Investigation**

   - Riven interviewed 81 employees across 12 departments
   - Found women received lower bonuses on average
   - **Counter:** Attack the methodology, not the conclusion
   - Sample sizes were skewed; statistics don't show unlawful discrimination, just a trend
3. **Timeline Issues**

   - Need to show termination decision was made independently of protected activity
   - Emphasize: performance warnings came BEFORE investigation

#### Key Retaliation Elements (4 Required):

1. Protected activity
2. Adverse employment action
3. Causal connection
4. [Fourth element not fully discussed]

**Strategy:** Focus on breaking the **causal connection** - show the termination would have happened regardless of the investigation.

### COPYRIGHT ISSUE (Fair Use)

#### The Facts:

- Riven wrote a song using 7-8 lines from an existing EchoCraft song
- The song was given to a school (educational use)
- EchoCraft received only $200
- The last line of Riven's song changed the meaning of the original

#### Fair Use Four-Factor Test:

| Factor                               | Riven's Position                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose & Character**        | Both songs used for same commercial/educational market       |
| **Nature of Copyrighted Work** | Creative work (song) - strong protection                     |
| **Amount & Substantiality**    | 7-8 lines taken - "amount and substantiality" is problematic |
| **Effect on Market**           | Same market - potential harm                                 |

#### Riven's Strongest Arguments:

1. **Amount Taken**

   - 7-8 lines is substantial
   - Taking "the heart" of the work even if not the whole thing
2. **Same Market**

   - Both songs used in educational markets
   - Direct competition

#### Riven's Weakest Points:

1. **Nonprofit/Educational Use**

   - Song was given to a school
   - Only $200 received - minimal profit
   - Precedent: Universities have won on nonprofit educational purpose
2. **Transformative Use?**

   - Riven's last line changed the meaning of the song
   - Made him sound like a "traitor" vs. the original's positive portrayal
   - Could argue transformative commentary

#### Key Insight from Discussion:

> "If there's not one [factor]... not win on a 4-part test, I think we could [still argue]..."

Even if you don't win all 4 factors, courts weigh them holistically.

## 🔗 Connecting the Two Issues

**Question raised:** Do the issues connect?

**Key insight from discussion:** The students had trouble seeing how the issues connect.

**Timeline is critical:**
- Riven was fired FIRST
- Ray found the song AFTER while going through Riven's desk
- This **severs any causal connection** between the copyright and the termination

**Strategic framing for EchoCraft:**
- The copyright claim CANNOT be retaliatory because EchoCraft didn't know about the song when they fired Riven
- If EchoCraft wins on retaliation (showing termination was legitimate based on performance), it undercuts Riven's overall narrative that the company acts vindictively
- Establish credibility on Issue 1 (retaliation) that carries over to Issue 2 (copyright)

---

## ✍️ Writing Strategy Tips

### 1. Credibility is Key

- Establish credibility in Issue 1 that carries over to Issue 2
- Present yourselves as a pro-equality company
- Don't be "the coldhearted company that doesn't pay women"

### 2. Storytelling Matters

- Consider your audience (what if the judge has "feminist leanings"?)
- Frame facts in a way that makes the reader sympathetic to your client
- The "little guy standing up" narrative is powerful - anticipate it

### 3. Dealing with Bad Precedent

- **Distinguish** unfavorable cases on their facts
- Find a key difference that makes your situation different
- "This is a different situation for whatever reason - this is the creative industry"
- **Acknowledge** unfavorable facts openly, then explain why they don't control

> "Not trying to hide them, not trying to sweep them under the rug - just saying 'and maybe this is so, but we have 3 other reasons why we are right nonetheless.'"

### 4. Research Strategy

- Look not just for cases that support you, but for the **strongest cases against you**
- Prepare responses to the best arguments the other side could make
- For copyright: songs are treated differently than books - find music-specific precedent

## 📚 Source Material: Moot Court Handbook (Pages 8-17)

### QUESTIONS PRESENTED

- Each question should be a **single sentence**
- Frame to **favor your position**
- See Neumann Ch. 31 for detailed guidance

### STATEMENT OF THE CASE

The Statement must include:
1. Facts relevant to the issues submitted for review
2. Relevant procedural history
3. Ruling(s) presented for review
4. **Citation to the record** for every fact (e.g., "R. 3")

**Critical rules:**
- Work with your partner - submit **one joint Statement**
- Include **ALL critical facts** - even those that undermine your position
- You lose credibility if you present only helpful facts
- All facts used in Argument **must appear** in Statement of the Case
- Feel free to **emphasize** favorable facts, but don't omit unfavorable ones

> "You will lose credibility with the court if you present only the facts that are helpful for your side. However, be careful not to detract from important facts with unnecessary, unhelpful details."

### SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

- Write **after** completing the Argument sections
- Short: roughly **1-2 pages**
- Summarizes **both** your argument and your partner's argument
- Work closely with partner so it reads like **one person drafted it**

### ARGUMENT SECTION GUIDANCE

**Six key principles from the Handbook:**

1. **Persuade judges** - A brief is meant to persuade; keep this central purpose in mind
2. **Make judges' jobs easier** - Educate them on the law while convincing them your reading is correct
3. **Explain law directly** - Don't bore with abstract discussion; direct attention to what's important; have a **consistent theory of the case** running through
4. **Argue YOUR position** - This is partisan advocacy, not a memo. But don't ignore contrary precedent:
   - **Ethics require** disclosing controlling contrary authority (Model Rules 3.3(a)(2))
   - **Strategic benefit**: Candid recognition of contrary authority wins the court's confidence
   - Then **distinguish** the cases or explain why policy favors your position
5. **Leave out minor arguments** - Choose the strongest, develop them well. A "laundry list" dilutes your best points and may signal desperation
6. **Strongest argument first** - Don't keep the court in suspense. State your position upfront, then support it

### STANDARD OF REVIEW

- **Must include** at least one paragraph setting forth the correct standard
- Two general standards:
  - **De novo** - appellate court substitutes its own judgment (typical for questions of law)
  - **Abuse of discretion/Clearly erroneous** - deferential; only reverse if irrational
- For summary judgment appeals: typically **de novo** (no witness credibility findings)
- Standard can significantly impact outcome - errors reversible under one standard may be insignificant under another

### RESPONDING TO CONTRARY AUTHORITY

**Four questions to ask about adverse cases:**

1. Has the holding been **narrowed or clarified** by subsequent opinions?
2. Are there favorable **lower or parallel court cases** factually similar to yours?
3. Can you suggest a **factual distinction** that casts doubt on applicability?
4. If directly on point and not distinguishable, can you suggest a **policy-based reason** to abandon the earlier approach?

**Opposition research:**
- Shepardize/KeyCite cases that support your opponent
- Look for cases that **overrule, distinguish, or narrow** the holding
- Check concurrences and dissents for useful language
- If a case hasn't been cited in a while, that itself may indicate it's no longer powerful

**Tone matters:**
- Avoid sarcasm or belittling your opponent
- Judges don't appreciate such tactics
- A signal that your opponent "misstates the facts" or that a case is "inapposite" is usually enough

## 📖 Source Material: Georgetown Handout - "Writing the Statement of the Case"

### (1) THEORY OF THE CASE: THE PERSUASIVE FOUNDATION

**Definition:** The unifying theme of your client's case - an implicit message that helps the reader empathize with your client.

> Facts explain *what happened*, law explains *legal implications*, but Theory of the Case is the **implicit message** throughout.

**Example:**
- Legal theory: Other driver was negligent
- Theory of the Case: "The driver was in a rush"
- Highlight facts supporting this: speeding, late for appointment, weaving through traffic

**Process tip:** Many writers draft the Statement objectively first, then edit to reflect their theory after establishing it through writing the Argument.

**Goal:** Convince the reader **before** they even reach the Argument section. Make your client more likeable or their actions more understandable.

### (2) BUILDING THE BASIC NARRATIVE

**Where you start matters:**
- Chronological is common but not always most persuasive
- Lead with facts that put your client in favorable light
- If opposing side is unlikeable, lead with facts illustrating this

**Example of framing:**
> "Mr. Smith, who had previously been convicted for tax fraud, stole three televisions..."
> Starting with negative information automatically associates the subject with wrongdoing.

**Include ALL legally relevant facts:**
- Leaving out key facts undermines credibility
- Makes Argument section confusing
- May violate Rules of Professional Responsibility
- If you discuss a fact in analysis, it **must** be in Statement of the Case
- Ignoring harmful facts doesn't make them go away - it leaves them unexplained and undefended

**Don't deceptively characterize:**
- Strategic framing ≠ blatant misrepresentation
- Deceptive characterizations damage credibility
- State facts accurately in a way that favors your client

**Avoid bias and overdrama:**
- Don't write a novel; tell a story
- Vivid language should be used strategically
- Too dramatic = judges won't take it seriously

**Bad example:**
> "Sarah Parker, a moral and upstanding citizen, first met the defendant, Jacob Smith—a suspicious and manipulative real estate agent..."

**Good example (subtle):**
> "The defendant, Jacob Smith, met Sarah Parker at a networking reception in early July. The following week, Smith began attempting to track Parker's financial activity..."

**Portray your client's position as the "default":**
- Instead of: "Individuals are prohibited from parking... unless [exceptions]"
- Write: "Individuals are allowed to park... except [restrictions]"
- Framing permissively alters the reader's perspective

### (3) BOLSTERING THE NARRATIVE

**Grasp and hold attention:**
- Statement should read like a **story**
- Use strong topic sentences and headings
- Avoid disjointed or rambling style
- Reader should glide through, picking up positive facts while paying little attention to negative ones

**Use names and titles strategically:**
- Refer to opposing party as "Plaintiff"/"Defendant" (emotionally distant)
- Refer to your client by name (more intimate)
- Note: Some court rules discourage Appellant/Appellee labels
- Alternative: Use job titles strategically (e.g., "Officer Monk" vs. just "Monk")

### (4) OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

**Include procedural posture:**
- Procedural history, nature of case, disposition of lower courts
- Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(6) requires one "Statement of the Case" including all three

**Don't waste space:**
- Every sentence should serve a purpose
- Background, transition, or distraction from negative facts
- Watch proportions - Argument is most important; Statement shouldn't dominate

**Include citations:**
- Almost every sentence should have a citation to the record
- Serves as accuracy check
- Confirms no "new facts" introduced in Argument

**Step back:**
- After manipulating word choice, step back and ask: Does this come across as a clear, reasonable presentation?
