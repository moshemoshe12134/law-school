## 🎭 Part 2: The Theory of the Case

**Your Core Narrative: "The Opportunist"**
*(Developed in Small Group with Neelam & Moshe)*

To win, you must provide a unifying narrative that explains *both* Riven's hostile behavior and his copyright lawsuit. The theory must move beyond legal technicalities to an emotional/logical truth about *who Riven is*.

### **The "Opportunist" Narrative Arc:**
1.  **The Context:** Riven knew his career at Echocraft was failing. His style was out of vogue, he was underperforming, and he saw the writing on the wall.
2.  **The Scheme:** To cushion his inevitable firing, he decided to **manufacture** claims against the company.
    *   **The "Virus" Comment:** When the CEO called him a "virus," it wasn't about gender or protected activity. It was because Riven was actively sabotaging the company culture to set up a lawsuit.
    *   **The Copyright Claim:** Similarly, he is trying to monetize a simple educational tool for a windfall.
3.  **Why this works:** It connects the two disparate issues. He isn't a "vigilante" (too sympathetic) or a "victim" (too weak). He is a calculator using the legal system to extort a company that simply tried to manage his poor performance.

## 📝 Part 3: Drafting the Statement of Facts

**"The most original and persuasive part of your brief."**

### **Golden Rules:**
1.  **Persuasion, Not Neutrality:** Unlike a legal memo, this is *not* objective. It must be accurate but selected and framed to advantage your client.
2.  **The "First Time" Rule:** Any fact mentioned in your Argument section **MUST** appear in your Statement of Facts first. No surprise facts in the argument!
3.  **Handling "Bad" Facts:**
    *   **Do Not:** Hide, lie, or sweep them under the rug.
    *   **Do:** Acknowledge them, then **neutralize** them.
    *   *Example:* If Riven has good reviews from 5 years ago, acknowledge them but immediately pivot to the *recent* decline (showing the termination was based on current performance, not history).

### **Integrating the Theory:**
*   Your Statement of Facts should subtly lead the reader to the "Opportunist" conclusion before they even read the Argument. Show, don't just tell, his opportunistic behavior through the timeline of events.

## ⚖️ Part 4: The Legal Arguments

### **Issue A: Retaliation (Title VII)**

**Core Strategy:** Break the **Causal Connection**.
*   *Theory:* You fired him for performance, not for the investigation.

**Key Arguments:**
1.  **Performance Pre-Dated Protected Activity:** Riven was failing quotas and receiving warnings *before* he ever investigated gender bonuses.
2.  **Flawed Investigation:** Attack his methodology (small sample size, cherry-picked data) to show his "investigation" was a sham (part of the Opportunist scheme), not reasonable protected activity.
3.  **The "Virus" Defense:** Ray's email calling him a "virus" refers to his *toxicity and scheming*, not his gender or his rights.
4.  **Timeline:** The decision to fire was set in motion by performance metrics, independent of his complaint.

### **Issue B: Copyright (Fair Use)**

**Core Strategy:** Focus on **Purpose** over **Amount**.

**Key Arguments:**
1.  **Purpose (Parody/Education):** Even if Echocraft used a lot of the song, it was for an internal educational skit/parody.
2.  **Fact vs. Expression:** Riven’s song contained historical facts (dates, events). **You cannot copyright facts.**
    *   *Argument:* "Although we took 7 lines, 5 of those lines were merely factual recitations of company history, which are not protectable. We only took a sliver of creative expression."
3.  **Market Effect:** Riven gave the song to a school for $200. There is no real market harm here; he is just seeking a windfall (Opportunist!).

## ✍️ Part 5: Writing Tactics & Style

*   **Structure:**
    *   Do not feel bound to argue prongs in numerical order (1, 2, 3, 4).
    *   **Lead with your winner.** If "Causal Connection" is your strongest point, argue it first.
    *   Concede or de-emphasize weaker prongs.
*   **Tone:** "Plain English." Be common-sensical. Avoid high-flown "legalese."
*   **Case Use:**
    *   Create a "Case Outline" (Good/Bad/Neutral cases).
    *   Use parentheticals to explain relevance quickly.
    *   **Distinguish Adverse Cases:** Don't ignore the strongest counter-arguments. Explain why *Riven's* best cases don't apply here.
