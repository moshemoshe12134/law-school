# LEGAL PRACTICE WORKSHOP II

## Spring 2026

**Thursday, 6:20-7:20pm, WJWH 207**\
**Instructor: Grace Vee**\
**Teaching Fellows: Jacob Turner & Clemens Wetcholowsky**

Welcome to the second half of Legal Practice Workshop. The focus of this
course is legal advocacy. You will spend the semester drafting an
appellate brief and preparing to argue the brief before a panel of
judges. The fact pattern for the brief was created by upper-year
students at Columbia.

You will be working closely with both your LPW instructor and two
student Teaching Fellows (also known as "Moot Court Student Editors" or
"Student Editors"). In addition to the scheduled class sessions, there
will be individual meetings and practice oral argument sessions. We
invite you to make appointments to speak with us as needed.

### Course Policies:

#### Attendance:

You are expected to attend every class session. Absent exceptional
circumstances, you should not schedule job interviews or attend
recruitment events that conflict with LPW. If you are unable to attend a
class, please reach out to Professor Vee as soon as possible.

#### Grading:

LPW is graded on a Pass/High Pass/Low Pass/Fail basis. A small number of
high-pass grades will be awarded for extraordinary performance in the
class. The High Pass grades are awarded based primarily upon (1)
performance on the written appellate brief, (2) engagement in the class
sessions; and (3) effort/level of improvement over the course of the
semester. Other factors that could affect your grade are attendance and
oral argument preparation.

#### Cell Phone Policy:

Cellphone use, including texting and/or checking messages, is not
permitted in class. If you have a family emergency or another urgent
situation requiring that you monitor personal messages, please consult
with me and/or with Student Services or the Office of Disability
Services, as detailed further below.

#### The Columbia Law School Writing Center:

We encourage you to make use of the Law School Writing Center, which
provides both one-on-one consultations and group workshops for students
seeking additional writing support. You do not need to notify us before
making an appointment or discussing your writing assignments with the
Writing Center staff. Information about the Writing Center, including
details about making appointments for one-on-one consultations and
attending workshops, is available here:

Columbia Law School is committed to the full inclusion of students with
disabilities in the life of the University. In accordance with Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act
(ADAAA), CLS provides accommodations and supports to students with
documented disabilities on an individual, case-by-case basis. To request
disability accommodations for this course, students must first be
registered with Disability Services (DS). Detailed information is

registration process, drop-in hours schedule, documentation requirements
and important deadlines. If you have already registered with DS, please
contact the CLS DS liaison.

#### Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence ("AI"):

1.  **Writing**\
    Students may use a spell-check program to search for typographical
    errors. Aside from spell-check, students may not use Chat GPT, Lexis
    Briefcheck, Lexis+AI/Protege, Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel,
    Harvey, the generative AI features in Grammarly, or any other form
    of artificial intelligence to write or edit their brief unless I
    have given specific instructions allowing students to use generative
    AI for a particular assignment. Using a generative AI tool for your
    LPW coursework without explicit permission will be treated as a
    violation of the academic rules prohibiting unauthorized assistance.
    In addition, the appellate problem that we are using in this class
    was written by other students, who invested great time and effort to
    create it. Uploading the moot court record to any AI platform is
    strictly prohibited.\
    In accordance with the policy above, improper uses of AI include:
    - Using AI to generate any words, sentences, paragraphs, or any
      other portion of the brief.
    - Using AI to rewrite, rephrase or edit things you have already
      written.
    - Copying AI-generated legal analysis or case summaries
    - Uploading the moot court record (or any other course materials) to
      any AI platform.
    - Uploading another student's work to any AI platform
2.  **Research**\
    Students may use all of the research tools at their disposal,
    including AI-assisted tools. However, students are cautioned that
    while AI is now embedded in many of the research engines that
    lawyers use, this poses a significant challenge for law students and
    new attorneys, who are still building the research and analytical
    skills needed to assess AI-generated search results. Because large
    language models can generate text that sounds clear and convincing,
    AI-generated search results may seem authoritative even when they
    are inaccurate or woefully incomplete. At the very least, students
    must do the following to assess the accuracy of AI-generated
    research results:
    - AI search tools may be very helpful in helping you find relevant
      cases or other authorities, but you must still read each authority
      (case/statute/regulation/etc.) for yourself before citing or
      relying on it.
    - Students may not rely on AI-generated summaries to avoid reading
      the legal authorities.
    - Before citing any case or legal authority, students should check
      whether the source is real and whether it is still "good law" and
      has not been overturned or superseded.
    - Students should use their own judgment to determine whether a
      source of law supports the point that they wish to make, since
      AI-generated summaries are often inaccurate, incomplete, or may
      mischaracterize the holding.
