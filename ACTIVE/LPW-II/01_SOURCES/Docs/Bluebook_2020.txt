Preface to the Twenty-First Edition

This edition of The Bluebook retains the same basic approach to legal
citation established by its predecessors. Some citation forms have been
expanded, reduced, or modified from previous editions. The Bluebook
strives to be responsive to suggestions from the legal community. In
this edition, we have focused on making The Bluebook more prac-
tical for modern legal practice. We made hundreds of edits, large
and small. Here are some of the most noteworthy changes, in order
of appearance:

To address word limit constraints in court documents, B6 now
provides practitioners with the option of closing up abbreviations in
reporter names. Bluctable BT2 has been heavily revised to reflect the
current local citation rules in the federal and state courts.

Rule 1.4 no longer dictates an order of authorities within a signal.
Instead, authorities should be ordered in a logical manner, with more
authoritative sources preceding less authoritative ones. Rule 1.5(b) has
been revised to clarify the placement of “hereinafter” and “last visited”
parentheticals in citations to internet sources. Rule 3.3(d) has been
added to illustrate citations to flush language and examples, such as
in Treasury Regulations. Rule 9(a) has been revised to clarify the use
of first names for judges. Rule 10.6.2 was added to bring The Bluebook
into conformity with current U.S. Supreme Court practice regarding
citations to stay or bail applications ruled on by a single Justice.
Rule 10.8.1(a) provides clearer guidance on citing to case docket
numbers. Rule 12 has been modified in several places to simplify cita-
tions to statutory sources. Rule 12.3 has been changed to require cita-
tion to the official federal code “if available,” rather than “whenever
possible.” This change is intended to facilitate citation to unofficial
codes in online databases. Rule 12.3.2 no longer requires a date in
citations to the federal code, whether official or unofficial. For state
sources of law, rule 12.5(b) now allows citation to online sources for
official state and municipal statutes and ordinances whenever available
online, rather than when only available online. The citation formats for
dissertations and theses were updated in rule 17.2.2. Rule 18 has been
updated throughout to provide a consistent format for indicating a
time marker in an audio or video recording. Rule 18.8 has been added
to provide guidance on citing photographs and illustrations. Rule 21
has been updated to reflect the growing availability of online sources
of international law.

The tables have also been updated.’Table T'1 has been revised to reflect
the most current titles for the various statutory compilations, session
laws, and administrative compilations and registers. Table T2 has
been removed from the print version of The Bluebook and now resides
exclusively online at www.legalbluebook.com, free of charge. It is

the compilers’ hope that the move online will enable more frequent
updates to the content of this table. For the Twenty-First Edition,
eleven jurisdictions in Table T2 have been comprehensively updated
and one new jurisdiction has been added. The compilers are indebted
to the legal scholars from these jurisdictions who dedicated their time
to improving The Bluebook. Abbreviations for case names in citations,
abbreviations for institutional authors in citations, and abbreviations
for periodical titles in citations have been combined into table T6.
Accordingly, table T13.1 from the Twentieth Edition, containing
abbreviations for common institutional names, has become table T13
in the Twenty-First Edition. Terms have been added to or modified in
tables T6, 17,110,113, and T15 as appropriate.

‘The compilers wish to thank our Coordinating Editor Mary Miles
Prince for working with us in updating and improving The Bluebook.
‘The compilers would also like to acknowledge outside commentators
who contributed their expertise to the Twenty-First Edition of The
Bluebook. The compilers are grateful to the many law review editors,
law librarians, and practitioners who responded to our calls for feed-
back with helpful comments and advice.

Finally, the compilers request that any errors, omissions, or sugges-
tions for revisions be reported to the Harvard Law Review, Gannett
House, 1511 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 or
to editor@legalbluebook.com. Errors may be corrected in the Blue-
book Online, at www.legalbluebook.com, prior to their correction in
the next printing of The Bluebook. Online subscribers are encouraged to
look there for the most up-to-date version of The Bluebook.

THE .
BLUEBOOK

A Uniform System of Citation”
Twenty-First Edition

www.legalbluebook.com


============================================================
PAGE 20
============================================================



============================================================
PAGE 21
============================================================

Introduction

Welcome to The Bluebook, the definitive style guide for legal citation in the
United States. For generations, law students, lawyers, scholars, judges, and
other legal professionals have relied on The Bluebook’s uniform system of
citation. In a diverse and rapidly changing legal profession, The Bluebook
continues to provide a systematic method by which members of the profession
communicate important information about the sources and legal authorities
upon which they rely in their work.

The Bluebook can often be intimidating for new users. This introduction is
meant to assist you as you begin what will likely become a lifelong relationship
with the Bluebook system of legal citation.

Structure of The Bluebook

The Bluebook contains three major parts. The first part contains the Bluepages,
a how-to guide for basic legal citation. Unlike the remainder of The Bluebook,
which is designed in a style and at a level of complexity commensurate with
the needs of the law journal publication process, the Bluepages provide easy-
to-comprehend guidance for the everyday citation needs of law students,
summer associates, law clerks, practicing lawyers, and other legal professionals.
The examples used throughout the Bluepages are printed using simple
typeface conventions common in the legal profession.

‘The second part, printed on white paper, is the heart of the B/uebook system of
citation: the rules of citation and style. This part is subdivided into two main
sections: the first section, consisting of rules 1 through 9, establishes general
standards of citation and style for use in all forms of legal writing. The second
section, consisting of rules 10 through 21, presents rules for citation of specific
kinds of authority such as cases, statutes, books, periodicals, and foreign and
international materials. The examples used throughout this part are printed
using typeface conventions standard in law journal footnotes.

The third part consists of a series of tables to be used in conjunction with the
rules. The tables show, among other things, which authority to cite and how
to abbreviate properly. Individual tables are referenced throughout the book.
Finally, there is a comprehensive index.

General Principles of Citation

The central function of a legal citation is to allow the reader to efficiently
locate the cited source. Thus, the citation forms in The Bluebook are designed
to provide the information necessary to lead the reader directly to the specific
items cited. Because of the ever-increasing range of authorities cited in legal
writing, no system of citation can be complete. Therefore, when citing material
of a type not explicitly discussed in this book, try to locate an analogous type
of authority that is discussed and use that citation form as a model. Always
be sure to provide sufficient information to allow the reader to find the cited
material quickly and easily.



============================================================

============================================================

Getting Started

‘The Bluepages provide the best place to begin your study of The Bluebook system
of legal citation. Indeed, first-year legal writing professors may wish to rely on
the Bluepages as a teaching aid. The Bluepages provide only an abbreviated
introduction to’ The Bluebook system, however, and do not contain answers
to more difficult citation questions. For this reason, the Bluepages contain
references to related rules and tables found in other parts of The Bluebook.


============================================================
PAGE 23
============================================================

Structure of Legal Citations Bi |

The Bluepages are a guide for practitioners and law clerks to use when citing
authority in non-academic legal documents. Please keep the following in mind:

INTRODUCTION

Local Rules. Many courts have their own rules of citation that differ in
some respects from The Bluebook. Make sure to abide by any citation
requirements of the court to which you are submitting your docu-
ments. An index of jurisdiction-specific citation rules is contained in
Bluepages table BT2.

Typeface. The Bluepages keep the tradition of underscoring certain
text. So long as you are consistent, however, you may substitute italics
wherever underscoring is used in the Bluepages. The remainder of
The Bluebook employs a more complex array of typeface conventions,
including ordinary roman type, italics, and LARGE AND SMALL CAPS.
These differences are explained in Bluepages B2.

The Whitepages. Where the Bluepages and local court rules are

silent regarding the citation of a particular document, you may use
the other rules in The Bluebook, referred to as the “Whitepages,” to
supplement the Bluepages. Keep in mind the typeface differences
between academic documents and non-academic legal documents as
explained in Bluepages B2.

The Elements of a Citation. Generally, a legal citation is composed of
three elements: (1) a signal; (2) the source or authority; and (3) paren-
thetical information. The Bluepages explore each of these elements in
detail.

Special Note for Law Students: The Bluebook is primarily written for two
types of users: academics and practitioners. The Whitepages provide rules
for academic publications such as law review articles and research papers.
The Bluepages set forth permissible deviations from the Whitepages that are
designed to accommodate the needs of lawyers and law clerks. The Bluepages
are used primarily for briefs, motions, memoranda, and opinions. For the most
part, the Bluepages only provide examples of how a citation should look. For
comprehensive discussions of the elements of a citation, you should refer to the
corresponding Whitepages as cross-referenced in the Bluepages.

Bluepages Tip: The Bluepages parallel the Whitepages in numbering and
content. You may use a Whitepage rule to supplement a corresponding
Bluepage rule.

Structure of Legal Citations B1

Citation Sentences and Clauses B11

In non-academic legal documents, such as briefs and opinions, citations
generally appear within the text of the document immediately following the
propositions they support. Footnotes should only be used in non-academic
legal documents when permitted or required by local court rules.


============================================================
PAGE 24
============================================================

Structure of Legal Citations

A citation may be inserted into the text of a document in one of two ways: as a
stand-alone citation sentence or as a citation clause.

Citation sentences begin with a capital letter and end with a period. One
citation sentence may contain multiple citations separated by semicolons.
Use citation sentences to cite sources and authorities that relate to the entire

preceding sentence:

The U.S. Supreme Court has the power to invalidate statutes that
are repugnant to the U.S. Constitution. Marbury. Madison, 5 U.S.

(6 Cranch) 87, 139 (1810) (state laws); Dred Scott v. Sandford 60 US.
(19 How.) 393, 449 (1856), superseded by constitutional amendment,
U.S. Const. amend. XIll. The U.S. Supreme Court also has the power
to review state court decisions. Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 14 U.S. (1
Wheat.) 304, 377-78 (1816) (civil cases); Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6
Wheat.) 264, 350 (1821) (criminal cases).

Citation clauses are set off from the text by commas and immediately
follow the proposition to which they relate. Do not begin a citation clause
with a capital letter unless the citation clause begins with a source that would
otherwise be capitalized. Do not end a citation clause with a period, unless
it is the last clause in the sentence. Use citation clauses to cite sources and
authorities that relate to only part of a sentence:

The Supreme Court adopted a broad reading of the Commerce Clause
during the New Deal, see Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 128-29
(1942), though in recent years the Supreme Court has reined in its
broad reading somewhat, see United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549,
624 (1995); United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 612-13 (2000);
Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2587 (2012); but
see Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 39 (2005).

B1.2 Introductory Signals

A signal is a shorthand message to the reader about the relationship between
a proposition and the source or authority cited for that proposition. Refer to
rule 1.2 for more information on how to use these signals.

Bluepages Tip: Signals are capitalized when used to begin a citation

sentence but are lowercase when used to begin a citation clause.

Signal

[no signal]

Use

The authority directly states a proposition, is the
source of a quotation, or was mentioned in the
proposition

The authority is one of multiple authorities directly
stating the same proposition

The authority is one of multiple authorities directly
stating or supporting the proposition, and one of the
other authorities was mentioned in the proposition

: The authority supports, but does not directly state,

the proposition



============================================================
PAGE 25
============================================================

Structure of Legal Citations Bi |

See also The authority provides additional material
supporting the proposition

(lis The authority is different from the main proposition
but sufficiently analogous to lend support

Compare ...[and] The authorities are similar or different in important

... With .. respects

[and]...

Contra The authority directly states a proposition contrary to
the main proposition

But see The authority clearly supports a proposition contrary
to the main proposition

But cf. The authority supports a proposition analogous to
the contrary of the main proposition

See generally The authority is helpful background material related

to the proposition

¢ Bluepages Tip: You may combine “e.g.,” with “see” and “but see” to form
“see, e.g.,” and “but see, e.g.,” respectively.

When using more than one type of signal in a citation sentence, the signals
(together with the authorities they introduce) should appear in the order in
which they appear in the table above. For more information about the grouping
and ordering of signals, see rule 1.3.

Separate authorities within each signal with semicolons. If certain authorities are
considerably more helpful or authoritative than the other authorities, you may
list the more helpful authorities first.

For further guidance on the order of authorities, see rule 1.4.

Explanatory Parentheticals B13

Regardless of the type of authority you cite, it may be helpful to include
additional information to explain the relevance of the cited authority. Append
this information parenthetically at the end of your citation (but before any
subsequent history).

Explanatory parentheticals should begin with a present participle unless the
parenthetical contains a quoted sentence or a short statement. You may omit
extraneous words such as “the” unless doing so would cause confusion. Do not
begin with a capital letter or end with a period unless the parenthetical consists
of a quotation that reads as a full sentence:

See Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 264 (1984) (explaining
that the final judgment rule reduces potential for parties to “clog the
courts” with time-consuming appeals).

Atl. Richfield Co. v. Fed. Energy Admin., 429 F. Supp. 1052, 1061-62
(N.D. Cal. 1976) (“Not every person aggrieved by administrative action
is necessarily entitled to the protections of due process.”).

5 U.S.C. § 553(b) (2000) (requiring agencies to publish notice of
proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register).


============================================================

@ a2 Li Typeface for Court Documents

Such standards have been adopted to address a variety of environ-
mental problems. See, e.g., H.B. Jacobini, The New International Sani-
tary Regulations, 46 Am. J. Int’\L. 727, 727-28 (1952) (health-related
water quality); Robert L. Meyer, Travaux Preparatoires for the UNESCO
World Heritage Convention, 2 Earth L.J. 45, 45-81 (1976) (conservation
of protected areas).

For further guidance on explanatory parentheticals, see rule 1.5.

Typeface for Court Documents
Court documents and legal memoranda use two typefaces: ordinary type and
italics (or underscoring).

While the Bluepages use underscoring rather than italics, keep in mind
that underscoring is the equivalent of italics. For citations appearing in
non-academic legal documents, follow these general rules:

Italicize (or underscore) the following information in a citation clause:

Case names, including procedural phrases introducing case names;

Titles of books and articles;

Titles of some legislative materials;

Introductory signals;

Explanatory phrases introducing subsequent case history;

Cross references, such as id. and supra; and

Words and phrases introducing related authority, such as “quoted in.”
Italicize (or underscore) the following information in the text of a legal
document:

Titles of publications, such as The New York Times;

Words italicized in the original source of a quotation; and

Any other word that would otherwise be italicized, such as an
uncommon foreign word.

Subdivisions B3

Give page numbers before date parentheticals, without any introductory
abbreviation such as “p.” or “at.” Cite nonconsecutive pages by giving the
individual page numbers separated by commas (e.g., “101, 103”).

To cite a footnote or endnote, give the page on which the note appears, “n.,”and
the footnote number:

United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938).

When the volumes are numbered, cite the volume number in Arabic numerals.
If the author of the entire work is cited, the volume number precedes the
author’s name:

3 Ronald E. Mallen, Jeffrey M. Smith & Allison D. Rhodes, Legal
Malpractice 101-02 (2014).

If an authority is organized by section (§) or paragraph ({]), you may cite to
these subdivisions.

Most subdivisions (such as columns or sections) in citations are abbreviated.
See table T'16 for a list of subdivision abbreviations.

Quotations

Short Citation Forms

You may use “id.” when citing the immediately preceding authority, but only
when the immediately preceding citation contains only one authority. Always
indicate when a subsequent citation refers to a different page number in the
same source (e.g., “id. at 5”).

You may use “supra” and “hereinafter” to refer to legislative hearings; court
filings; books; pamphlets; reports; unpublished materials; non-print resources;
periodicals; services; treaties and international agreements; regulations,
directives, and decisions of intergovernmental organizations; and internal
cross-references. You should not use “supra” and “hereinafter” to refer to cases,
statutes, constitutions, legislative materials (other than hearings), restatements,
model codes, or regulations, except in extraordinary circumstances, such as
when the name of the authority is extremely long.

Quotations

Generally

Enclose all quotations, except block quotations, with quotation marks. Place
commas or periods inside the quotation marks, but place all other punctuation
outside the quotation marks unless such punctuation is part of the quoted text:

“When, as here, the plaintiff is a public figure, he cannot recover
unless he proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant
published the defamatory statement with actual malice, i.e., with
‘knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether

it was false or not.’” Masson v. New Yorker Mag., Inc., 501U.S. 496,
510 (1991) (quoting N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80
(1964)).

“We refused to permit recovery for choice of language which, though
perhaps reflecting a misconception, represented ‘the sort of inaccu-
racy that is commonplace in the forum of robust debate to which the
New York Times rule applies.” Masson v. New Yorker Mag., Inc., 501
U.S. 496, 519 (1991) (citation omitted).

Bluepages Tip: A quotation appearing within another quotation can either
be parenthetically attributed to its original source or otherwise acknowl-
edged by indicating that a citation has been omitted.

For further guidance on quotations, including omissions and alterations of
quoted material, see rule 5.

Block Quotations

Quotations of fifty or more words should be single spaced, indented on
both sides, justified, and without quotation marks. This is known as a block
quotation. Quotation marks within a block quotation should appear as they
do in the quoted material. The citation following a block quotation should
not be indented but should begin at the left margin on the line following the
quotation:



============================================================
PAGE 29
============================================================

Italicization for Style and in Unique Circumstances

[T]his presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our
historic commitment to the rule of law. This is nowhere more
profoundly manifest than in our view that “the twofold aim
[of criminal justice] is that guilt shall not escape or innocence
suffer.” We have elected to employ an adversary system of crim-
inal justice in which the parties contest all issues before a court
of law... . To ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the
function of courts that compulsory process be available for the
production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or by
the defense.

United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 708-09 (1974) (citation omitted).
The Court then balanced this interest against the evils of forced disclo-
sure. Id. at 710.

Abbreviations, Numerals, and Symbols

Tables at the end of this book contain lists of specific abbreviations for arbitral
reporters (T'5), case names, institutional author names, and common words in
periodical titles (T'6), court names (7), explanatory phrases (I'S), legislative
documents (T9), geographical terms (‘T'10), judges and officials (T'11), months
(T'12), institutional names in periodical titles (T13), publishing terms (T14),
services (115), and subdivisions (T'16).

Close up adjacent single capitals (U.S.), but do not close up single capitals with
longer abbreviations (S. Ct.). Every abbreviation should be followed by a period
(Univ.), except those in which the last letter is set off by an apostrophe (Soc’y).

Because many court systems impose word limits on briefs and other documents
submitted to the court, abbreviations in reporter names may optionally be
closed to conserve space, even if they would normally be separated under
this rule. For example, “S. Ct.” would become “S.Ct.” and “F. Supp. 2d” would
become “F.Supp.2d.”

Spell out the numbers zero to ninety-nine. Use numerals for larger numbers
(unless they begin a sentence).

For more information about abbreviations, numerals, and symbols, see rule 6.

Italicization for Style and in Unique Circumstances
Words and phrases may be italicized (or underscored) for emphasis.

You may italicize (or underscore) non-English words and phrases unless they
have been incorporated into common English usage. Most Latin words and
phrases that are used in legal writing are in common English usage. Obsolete
or uncommon Latin words and phrases, however, should be italicized (or
underscored).

“Id.” is always italicized (or underscored).

For more information about italicizing for style, see rule 7.

Titles of Judges

B8 = Capitalization

In addition to capitalizing “Court” when naming any court in full or when
referring to the U.S. Supreme Court, also capitalize “Court” in documents
when referring to the court that will receive your documents.

While court documents can be abbreviated in accordance with Bluepages
B17.1.1and Bluepages table BT‘ in citations, do not abbreviate the titles of
court documents in textual sentences:

This Court has already ruled on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.

But: The court in Watkins was attempting to distinguish earlier precedent
pointing in the other direction.

Only capitalize party designations such as “Plaintiff,”“Defendant,” “Appellant,”
and “Appellee” when referring to parties in the matter that is the subject of your
document:
Plaintiff denies Defendant’s baseless allegations of misconduct.
But: In Smith, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant acted in bad faith.

Capitalize the title of a court document only when: (1) the document has been
filed in the matter that is the subject of your document; and (2) the reference
is to the document's actual title or a shortened form thereof. Do not capitalize
references to the generic name of a court document:

In their Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are
strictly liable for Plaintiffs’ injuries.

The Court’s Order of May 7, 2004, directed Plaintiffs to cease produc-
tion immediately.
But: There is no doubt that the initial temporary restraining order was
within the bounds of this Court’s discretion.

¢ Bluepages Tip: Do not abbreviate the titles of court documents in textual
sentences:

For all of the above reasons, Appellant’s Petition for Rehearing ought
to be granted.

Not: For all of the above reasons, Appellant’s Pet. Reh’g ought to be
granted.

B9 Titles of Judges

Justices are referred to as “Justice Story” and “Chief Justice Jay.” Parenthetical
references are to “Holmes, J.,” “Cardozo, J.,” and “Black & White, JJ.” Judges
are referred to as “Judge Wisdom,” ‘Judge Hand,” and “Chief Judge Friendly.”

For more information on how to refer to judges and other officials, see rule 9.

Not: In the Matter of J. Fairfax

(v) Abbreviate words listed in table T6, unless the citation appears in a textual
sentence as explained in (vi) below. Abbreviate states, countries, and other
geographical units according to table T10, unless the geographical unit is a
named party. Never abbreviate “United States” when it is a named party. Omit
“The” as the first word of a party’s name, unless it is part of the name of the
object of an in rem action. You may abbreviate any words with eight letters or
more if substantial space is saved and the result is unambiguous. You may also
abbreviate entities with widely recognized initials, such as NAACP and FCC:

Seattle Times v. Univ. of Wash.

Not: The Seattle Times v. The University of Washington

United States v. Haskell
Not: U.S. v. Erin Haskell, et al.

Indus. Chems., Inc. v. City of Tuscaloosa

Not: Industrial Chemicals, Inc. v. The City of Tuscaloosa

Laidlaw Corp. v. NLRB
Not: The Laidlaw Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board

For more guidance on abbreviation, see rule 10.2.

Bluepages Tip: Underline the entire case name up to but not including the
comma that follows the case name.

(vi) When referring to the full name of a case in a textual sentence, as opposed
to a citation sentence or clause, underline the case name and only abbreviate
widely known acronyms and the following eight words: “&,” (“and”), “Ass’n,”
(“association”), “Bros.,” (“brothers”), “Co.,” (“company”), “Corp.,” (“corporation”),
“Inc.,” (“incorporated”), “Ltd.,” (“limited”), and “No.,” (“number”). The first
time you mention a case in the text, follow the case name with the remaining
elements of a full citation, set off by commas:

In Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York, 366 N.E.2d 1271
(N.Y. 1977), the court applied a version of the diminution in value rule.

Not: In Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 366 N.E.2d 1271 (N.Y.
1977), the court applied a version of the diminution in value rule.

In a subsequent reference to the case within the same general discussion, you
may simply refer to one party’s name (or a readily identifiable shorter version of
one party’s name) if the reference is unambiguous:

The Supreme Court’s recent takings jurisprudence has gradually
moved away from the New York Court of Appeals’s formulation in Penn
Central.
Not: The Supreme Court’s recent takings jurisprudence has gradually
moved away from the New York Court of Appeals’s formulation in City of
New York.

Cases

Reporters and Pinpoint Citations

Cite a reporter by listing: (1) the volume number of the reporter in which
the case is published; (2) the abbreviated name of the reporter (listed in
table T1); and (3) the page on which the case report begins. If word limits are a
consideration, Bluepages B6 optionally permits reporter abbreviations in court
documents to be closed.

To point your reader to the specific pages that relate to the cited proposition,
you must also include a pinpoint citation, often called a “pincite.” Place
pincites after the page on which the case report begins, separated by a comma.

A pincite may consist of a page range, in which instance you should indicate
the first and last page of the range separated by an en dash or hyphen. Where
the page numbers consist of three or more digits, drop any repetitious digits
other than the final two digits (e.g., 102-06; 1020-30). To cite multiple pages
that are not consecutive, list each page or page range, separated by commas
(e.g., 103, 106-08, 132). If the material you wish to reference appears on more
nonconsecutive pages than is convenient to list in one citation, you may use
passim in lieu of a pincite. To cite a footnote, give the page on which the
footnote appears, “n.,” and the footnote number, with no space between “n.”
and the footnote number (e.g., 199 n.4):

Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 195 (1962).
Newdowv. U.S. Cong., 328 F.3d 466, 471 n.3 (9th Cir. 2003).

Garfias-Rodriguez v. Holder, 702 F.3d 504, 514 (9th Cir. 2012) (“This is
a permissible reading of the statute.”).

Bluepages Tip: If the pincite is the first page of the case, simply repeat the
page number:

United States v. Baxter, 492 F.2d 150, 150 (9th Cir. 1973).

For further guidance on pincites, see rule 3.2.

Court and Year of Decision

Indicate parenthetically the deciding court followed by the year of decision
(immediately following the page reference). When citing decisions of the
United States Supreme Court, however, do not include the name of the
deciding court. Table T1 lists the correct abbreviations for courts in U.S.
jurisdictions.

(i) The United States Supreme Court: Cite United States Reports (U.S.) if the
opinion appears therein; otherwise, cite to Supreme Court Reporter (S. Ct.):

Meritor Sav. Bankv. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 60 (1986).

Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 139 S. Ct. 361, 365
(2018).

(ii) Federal Courts of Appeals: Cite Federal Reporter (F., F.2d, or F.3d) and
indicate the name of the court parenthetically:

United States v. Jardine, 364 F.3d 1200, 1203 (10th Cir. 2004).

(iii) Federal District Courts: Cite Federal Supplement (F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d,
or F. Supp. 3d) and indicate the name of the court parenthetically:

W. St. Grp. LLC v. Epro, 563 F. Supp. 2d 84, 91 (D. Mass. 2008).
Harris v. Roderick, 933 F. Supp. 977, 985 (D. Idaho 1996).

Bluepages Tip: The correct abbreviation for each state is listed in table T10.
Some state names are abbreviated with two capital letters (e.g., N.Y.), while
others are abbreviated with one capital letter and several lowercase letters
(e.g., Mich.). Do not include a space between adjacent single capital letters
(e.g., S.D.N.Y.), but do include a space between a single capital letter anda
longer abbreviation (e.g., “D. Conn.” for “District of Connecticut” and “S.D.
Cal.” for “Southern District of California”). For more guidance on abbrevia-

tions, see rule 6.1.

(iv) State High Courts: Cite the regional reporter for the region in which
the court sits, if the opinion appears therein; otherwise, cite the state’s official
reporter, as listed in table T1. Indicate the state parenthetically, unless it is
unambiguously conveyed by the reporter title:

People v. Armour, 590 N.W.2d 61 (Mich. 1999).

Campbell v. Gen. Motors Corp., 649 P.2d 224 (Cal. 1982).

Bates v. Tappan, 99 Mass. 376 (1868).
(v) Other State Courts: Cite the regional reporter for the region in which
the court sits, if the opinion appears therein; otherwise, cite the state’s official
reporter, as listed in table T1. Indicate parenthetically the state and court of
decision, unless unambiguously conveyed by the reporter title. Do not indicate
the department or district of intermediate state courts:

Lundman v. McKown, 530 N.W.2d 807 (Minn. Ct. App. 1995).

Rusk v. State, 406 A.2d 624 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1979), rev’d, 424 A.2d

720 (Md. 1981).

Campbell v. Parker-Hannifin Corp., 82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 202 (Ct. App. 1999).

Parallel Citation in State Court Documents

In documents submitted to state courts, all case citations should be to the
reporters required by local rules. To find local rules for the court to which you
are submitting a document, refer to Bluepages table BT2.

Local rules sometimes require citation of both the official state reporter and the
unofficial regional or state-specific reporter. This is called parallel citation. Where
a pincite is necessary, include one for each reporter citation. When the state or
court is clear from the official reporter title, omit it from the date parenthetical:
Pledger v. Halvorson, 324 Ark. 302, 921S.W.2d 576 (1996).
Kenford Co. v. Cnty. of Erie, 73 N.Y.2d 312, 537 N.E.2d 176, 540 N.Y.S.2d

1 (1989).
Pending and Unreported Cases

(i) LEXIS and Westlaw cases: Cite to the LEXIS or Westlaw electronic report
of the case when one is available.


============================================================
PAGE 35
============================================================

Cases

‘The proper format is as follows: (1) case name; (2) case docket number; (3)
database identifier and electronic report number; (4) star page number; and (5)
court and full date parenthetical:

Albrecht v. Stranczek, No. 87 C 9535, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5088, at *1,
*3 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 15, 1991).

Kvaas Constr. Co. v. United States, No. 90-266C, 1991 WL 47632, at
*2-3 (Cl. Ct. Apr. 8, 1991).

Bluepages Tip: Different courts and publishers use different formats for
case docket numbers (e.g., CIV-A, Civ. A., Civ., No.). Cite the case docket
number exactly as it appears. If more than one docket number is assigned
to acase, the lead-in language (e.g., CIV-A, Civ. A., Civ., No.) may be
omitted after the first reference:

PKFinans Int’l Corp. v. 1B] Schroder Leasing Corp., Nos. 93 Civ. 5375, 96
Civ. 1816 (SAS) (HBP), 1996 WL 525862 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 1996).

(ii) Slip opinions: When a case is unreported, but is separately available as a slip
opinion, give the docket number, the court, and the full date of the most recent
major disposition of the case:

Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters., No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.
30, 1977).

For further guidance on slip opinions, see rule 10.8.1(b).

(iii) Opinions only available online, but not in an electronic database: Some
cases, particularly ones that are pending, can only be accessed through a court’s
website. In this situation, the webpage URL may be included:

Kaye v. Trump, No. 5128, slip op. at 1 (N.Y. App. Div. Jan. 29, 2009),
http: //www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2009/2009_00452.htm.

Weight of Authority and Explanatory Parentheticals

To add information indicating the weight of the cited authority to a citation,
insert an additional parenthetical following the date parenthetical. Indicate
when you are citing a concurring or dissenting opinion:

Bush v. Gore, 531U.S. 98, 144 (2000) (5-4 decision) (Breyer, J.,
dissenting) (“The political implications of this case for the country are
momentous.”).

Zuni Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Dep’t of Educ., 550 U.S. 81, 113 (2007) (Scalia,
J., dissenting) (“The sheer applesauce of this statutory interpretation
should be obvious.”).

Webb v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 57 F.3d 1067 (4th Cir. 1995) (unpub-
lished table decision).

Wersba v. Seiler, 393 F.2d 937 (3d Cir. 1968) (per curiam).

An explanatory parenthetical may also be added to explain briefly the
proposition for which the case stands:

Green v. Georgia, 442 U.S. 95, 97 (1979) (per curiam) (holding that
exclusion of relevant evidence at a sentencing hearing constitutes
denial of due process).

Cases

For further guidance on explanatory parentheticals, see Bluepages B1.3 and
rule 1.5.

Prior or Subsequent History

A full citation should include the prior or subsequent history of the case,
subject to several exceptions discussed in rule 10.7. Use one of the abbreviated
explanatory phrases listed in table T8 to introduce the prior or subsequent
history. Include commonly used explanatory phrases such as “aff’d,” “aff’g,”
“cert. denied” (subject to a two-year limitation per rule 10.7), “cert. granted,”
“rev'd,” and “rev'd on other grounds” for every applicable citation. Underscore or

italicize the explanatory phrase:
Gucci Am.., Inc. v. Gold Ctr. Jewelry, 997 F. Supp. 399 (S.D.N.Y. 1998),
rev'd, 158 F.3d 631 (2d Cir. 1998).

Cooper v. Dupnik, 924 F.2d 1520, 1530-31 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that
police officers’ actions did not rise to level of due process violation),
rev’d en banc, 963 F.2d 1220 (9th Cir. 1992).

Cent. Ill. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Westervelt, 342 N.E.2d 463 (Ill. App. Ct.
1976), aff’d, 367 N.E.2d 661 (Ill. 1977).

Bluepages Tip: Explanatory parenthetical information about a case should
immediately precede information about subsequent case history.

When the case has a different name in the subsequent history, provide the new
case name, preceded by the phrase “sub nom.” (“under the name of”). There is
no need to provide the new case name if the parties’ names are merely reversed
or if the subsequent history is simply a denial of certiorari or rehearing:

Great W. United Corp. v. Kidwell, 577 F.2d 1256 (5th Cir. 1978), rev’d
sub nom. Leroy v. Great W. United Corp., 443 U.S. 173 (1979).

Short Form Citation

Once you have provided a full citation to an authority, you may use a “short
form” in later citations of the same authority, so long as (1) it is clear to the
reader which authority is referenced; (2) the full citation falls in the same
general discussion; and (3) the reader will have little trouble locating the full
citation. There are several acceptable short forms for case citations. All of these
forms include “at” followed, if necessary, by a pincite.

‘The following are all acceptable short form citations of page 100 of Palsgrafv.
Long Island R.R. Co, 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928):

Palsgraf, 162 N.E. at 100.

162 N.E. at 100.

Id. at 100.
When using only one party name in a short form citation, use the name of the
first party, unless that party is a geographical unit, a governmental entity, or
another type of common litigant. You may also shorten a long party name, for

example from First Nat’l Trust & Inv. Corp. to First Nat’l, so long as the reference
remains unambiguous.


============================================================
PAGE 37
============================================================

Cases

Short citations take a slightly different form for cases with parallel citations.
Chalfin v. Specter, 426 Pa. 464, 465, 233 A.2d 562, 563 (1967), becomes one of
the following:

Chalfin, 426 Pa. at 465, 233 A.2d at 563.

426 Pa. at 465, 233 A.2d at 563.

Id.
“id.” is the short form used to refer to the immediately preceding authority.

¢ Bluepages Tip: The “i” in “id.” is only capitalized when it begins a citation
sentence. The underline always runs under the period.

(i) When used alone, “id.” refers to the identical pincite referenced in the
immediately preceding citation:

The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that “apprehension by
the use of deadly force is a seizure subject to the reasonableness
requirement of the Fourth Amendment.” Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S.
1, 7 (1985). By contrast, minimal police interference will not always
constitute a “seizure” for Fourth Amendment purposes. Id.

(ii) To refer to a different page or footnote within the immediately preceding
authority, add “at” and the new pincite:

To determine whether a particular exercise of non-lethal police force
was reasonable, courts engage in a balancing process that weighs the
nature of the intrusion against the “governmental interests.” Id. at 8.

(iii) “Id.” may only be used when the preceding citation cites only one source:

This process weighs the nature of the exertion of force against the
governmental interests at stake. See Heath, 854 F.2d at 9. This is an
“objective reasonableness” test. Id.

In the example above, it is clear that “Id.” refers to Heath. By contrast, the use
of “id.” in the following example is improper because it is not clear to which
authority “id.” refers:

Not: To determine whether a particular exercise of non-lethal police force
was reasonable, courts engage in a balancing process. Tennessee v.
Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 8 (1985); see also Heath v. Henning, 854 F.2d 6, 8 (2d
Cir. 1988). This process weighs the nature of the exertion of force against
the governmental interests at stake. See id. at 9.

¢ Bluepages Tip: Sources identified in explanatory parentheticals, explana-
tory phrases, and prior or subsequent history are ignored for the purposes
of this rule.

(iv) The “id.” form for cases requiring parallel citations is as follows:

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court grappled with a similarly compli-
cated issue in an election dispute in 1967. See Chalfin v. Specter, 426
Pa. 464, 477, 233 A.2d 562, 568 (1967). In Chalfin, the court was forced
to reach a decision under a severely rushed schedule. See id. at 468,
233 A.2d at 564.

Statutes, Rules, and Restatements

Full Citation

Federal Statutes

A full citation of a federal statute includes: the official name of the act and
the published source in which the act can be found. It may also include a
parenthetical indicating either (i) the year the source was published or (ii) the
year the statute was passed (used for session laws):

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601-9675.

Department of Transportation Act, Pub. L. No. 89-670, § 9, 80 Stat.
931, 944-47 (1966).

Bluepages Tip: Nothing is underlined in a statute citation. “Section” is indi-
cated by the “§” symbol, the plural of which is “§§.” For further guidance
concerning citation of individual sections and subsections, see rule 3.3.

Codes and Session Laws

For statutes, cite a current official or unofficial code, an official or privately
published collection of session laws, or a secondary source. ule 12 provides
a full explanation of these sources and how to decide which one to include in
your citation.

If available, cite the current official code for statutes currently in force. The official
code for federal statutes is the United States Code, which is abbreviated “U.S.C.”

A citation of an official or unofficial code will tell the reader where a statute
can be found by listing: (1) the title number; (2) the abbreviated name of the
code; (3) the section numbers in which the act is codified; and (4) the year of
the cited code edition (not the year the act was passed). The year of the cited
code edition may be omitted when citing the official or unofficial United States
Code, but not when citing other collections of law. Citations of an unofficial
code, such as an “annotated code,” must also include the name of the publisher
in a parenthetical, alongside the date, if included:


============================================================
PAGE 39
============================================================

Statutes, Rules, and Restatements

1U.S.C. § 1.
15 U.S.C.A. § 205 (West).

To cite an individual provision of a statute, include the original section number
of the provision you wish to cite following the statute name. Note that the
“original section number” refers to a particular section of the act, not to the
section of the code in which that provision has been codified. Thus, in the first
example below, “§ 6” refers to section 6 of the Administrative Procedure Act,

while “§ 555” refers to section 555 of Title V of the United States Code:

Administrative Procedure Act § 6, 5 U.S.C. § 555.
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 § 102, 42 U.S.C. § 4332.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 § 103, 17 U.S.C.A. § 1201 (West).

Cite the session laws if the official or unofficial code is unavailable or
insufficient, for example, when the statute does not yet appear in a code or
when you need to refer to the historical fact of the statute’s enactment.

The official compilation of federal session laws is the Statutes at Large,
abbreviated as “Stat.” A citation of the Statutes at Large includes the following
elements: (1) the official or popular name of the statute; (2) the public law
number, abbreviated “Pub. L. No.”; (3) the section number, if any; (4) the
volume number, followed by “Stat.” and the number of the first page of the act;
and (5) the year the statute was passed. Session law citations may also pincite
the particular provision of the act cited and the particular page of the session
laws on which that provision appears:

Department of Transportation Act, Pub. L. No. 89-670, § 9, 80 Stat.
931, 944-47 (1966).

Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Pub. L.
No. 102-408, 106 Stat. 1992.

Bluepages Tip: Omit the year parenthetical if the name of the statute
includes its year of enactment.

For guidance on how to indicate a statute’s prior or subsequent history, see
rule 12.7.

State Statutes

For state statutes, cite an official code if available. Table T1.3 lists the official
and unofficial statutory compilations of each state, with the preferred official
code listed first. Although the citation form for individual state codes varies,
a full citation of most state codes includes the following elements: (1) the
abbreviated name of the code, as listed in table T1.3; (2) the cited section
number(s); and (3) the year of the cited code edition (not the year the act was
passed). Citations of an unofficial state code must also include the name of the
publisher in the date parenthetical:

Wash. Rev. Code § 28B.20.020 (2014).
Cal. Penal Code § 181 (West 2011).
N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law § 717 (McKinney 2000).

see rule 12.9.

Federal Tax Materials

Citation of federal tax materials is governed by special rules discussed in
rule 12.9.1 and table T1.2. In court documents and legal memoranda
discussing only the current version of federal tax laws, you may omit the year
and publisher parenthetical from citations of the Internal Revenue Code
(I.R.C.) and Treasury regulations.

Internal Revenue Code

In citations of the Internal Revenue Code, you may replace “26 U.S.C.” with
“LR.C.”:
26 U.S.C. § 61.
becomes: I.R.C. § 61.

Treasury Regulations

Treas. Reg. § 1.72-16(a) (1963).
Treas. Reg. § 1.72-16(a), Q&A (3)(a) (1963).

Treasury Determinations

When citing Treasury determinations in court documents and legal
memoranda, you may use the abbreviations contained in the introductory pages
of the Cumulative Bulletin. Thus, you may cite General Counsel Memoranda
as “G.C.M.” When citing Private Letter Rulings, you may use the abbreviation
“P.L.R.” and you may omit the dashes from the ruling number:

Rev. Rul. 83-137, 1983-2 C.B. 41.
I.R.S. P.L.R. 8601012 (Sept. 30, 1985).
I.R.S. G.C.M. 39,417 (Sept. 30, 1985).

Bluepages Tip: Tax Court and Board of Tax Appeals decisions are cited as
court decisions, not agency decisions. For further guidance, see table T1.1.

For guidance on citing materials from other administrative agencies, see
table T1.2.

Short Form Citation

After providing a full citation of a periodical, you may use “id.” or “supra”
in subsequent citations. Use “id.” to refer to periodical material cited in the
immediately preceding citation. Otherwise, use the “supra” form introduced
in Bluepages B15.2.

Bluepages Tip: When your document includes citations of more than one
source by the same author, include an abbreviated reference to the title of
the cited source in any supra citation:

Llewellyn, Remarks, supra, at 401-06.

Court and Litigation Documents

This rule focuses on citations to court documents that have been filed as part of
the same case. For citations of court documents filed in a different case, consult
rule 10.8.3.

Full Citation

A full citation of a court document includes the following elements: (1) the name
of the document, abbreviated where appropriate; (2) the pinpoint citation; and


============================================================
PAGE 45
============================================================

Court and Litigation Documents B17 )

(3) the date of the document, if required. The citation should also include the
Electronic Case Filing (ECF) number found on PACER, if applicable.

Abbreviation B17.1.1

Abbreviate the titles of court documents according to Bluepages table BT1.
Where there is an official record, such as the Record on Appeal in appellate
litigation, always abbreviate “Record” to “R.” Do not abbreviate, however, when
doing so will confuse the reader:

Petitioner admits filing suit more than one year after knowledge of the
facts underlying its claim, Pet’r’s Br. 6, and further admits the applica-
bility of a one-year statute of limitations, Pet’r’s Br. 7.

In Defendant’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant asserts that
the dangerous conditions giving rise to the accident resulted from
someone else’s negligence, Def.’s Mem. Supp. Summ. }. 6, 9, implying
that Defendant was, indeed, aware of the risk. Yet, in his Affidavit filed
in support of the Motion, Defendant explicitly states that he had no
knowledge of the rising water level. Def.’s Aff. 111 5-7; see also Jones
Aff. Ex. A, at 2.

¢ Bluepages Tip: You may enclose citations of court documents in
parentheses:

(Def.’s Resp. to Pl.’s Interrog. No. 3.)

Pinpoint Citations B17.1.2

Provide a precise reference to the cited document, such as to the page and line on
which the material appears in a deposition or trial transcript. Use commas only
to avoid confusion. Separate page and line references by a colon. Page references
should not be preceded by “p.,” but other subdivisions should be identified. You
are generally not required to precede pincites with “at,” though it is customary
to use “at” in references to certain sources such as appellate records (e.g., R. at 5):

Hawkins Aff. 6.

Trial Tr. vol. 2, 31.

Pet’r’s Br. 6.

Clark Dep. 15:21-16:4.

Pls.’ Am. Answer to Def.’s Countercl. 3-4.

Travis Decl. Ex. B, at 3.

R. at 9.

Date B17.1.3

Provide the date of the cited document when: (1) more than one document has
the same title; (2) the date is relevant to the discussion; or (3) the date is needed
to avoid confusion:

Plaintiff alleged that Defendant was driving at a rate far in excess of
the posted speed limit. Compl. 4] 7. However, her sworn testimony is to 25

the effect that she never saw the Defendant before the accident and
was thus unable to gauge his speed. Perryman Dep. 34:15-18, Aug. 7,
2002; Trial Tr. vol. 2, 51-52, Dec. 12, 2002.

had such authority, Beatrice Aff. 4] 2, June 2, 2003.

B17.1.4 Electronic Case Filings (ECF)

Court documents filed with the electronic case management system employed
by PACER for federal cases are assigned document numbers. Add this
Electronic Case Filing (ECF) number to the citations of electronically filed
documents.

Feder Dep. 5:30-12:10, ECF No. 6.
Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 2, ECF No. 15.

¢ Bluepages Tip: Documents filed on PACER are imprinted with an ECF
header. If these page numbers are different from the page numbers of the
filed document, use the page numbers of the original document. i

B17.2 Short Form Citation

After providing a full citation, you may use a short form if: (1) it will be clear
to the reader what you are citing; (2) the full citation falls in the same general
discussion; and (3) the reader will have little trouble locating the full citation:

First Reference Succeeding Reference

App. to Pet. Cert. 137-39, ECF No. i App. 137-39, ECF No. 15, or
15. App. 137-39.

¢ Bluepages Tip: For court documents, id. should only be used if significant
Space will be saved.

balance, slip, and fall. Leach Aff. 33-39. This fall led to numerous
hospital visits costing well over $10,000. Id. at 52.

This table provides suggested abbreviations for words commonly found in
the titles of court documents. Use these abbreviations in citations to court
documents according to Bluepages B17.1.1 and B17.2. This table also indicates
certain words that should not be abbreviated. Unless otherwise indicated,
plurals are formed by adding the letter “s.”

Words of seven or more letters not appearing in this table may also be
abbreviated, so long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.

Omit all articles and prepositions from an abbreviated title, unless the result
will confuse the reader. Other extraneous words may also be omitted, so long as

the reader can unambiguously identify the cited document.

_) Structure and Use of Citations ‘

= STRUCTURE AND USE OF CITATIONS 1

Provide citations to authorities so that readers may identify and find those
authorities for future research. Citations are made in citation sentences and
clauses (rule 1.1) and are introduced by signals. Signals organize authorities
and show how those authorities support or relate to a proposition given in
the text (rule 1.2), Citation sentences and clauses may contain more than
one signal. Order signals according to rule 1.3. Within each signal, arrange
authorities according to rule 1.4. Parentheticals may be necessary to explain
the relevance of a particular authority to the proposition given in the text
(rule 1.5). Certain additional information, specific to that authority, may also
be appended according to rule 1.6.

Citation Sentences and Clauses in Law Reviews 1.1

Citations may be made in one of two ways: in citation sentences or in citation
clauses. In law review pieces, all citations appear in footnotes appended to the
portions of the text to which they refer. For an explanation of citation sentences
and clauses in practitioners’ documents, see Bluepages B1.

(a) Text. Citations to authorities that support (or contradict) a proposition
made in the main text (as opposed to footnote text) are placed in footnotes.
A footnote call number should appear at the end of a textual sentence if the
cited authority supports (or contradicts) the entire sentence. In contrast, a call
number should appear within the sentence next to the portion it supports if
the cited authority supports (or contradicts) only that part of the sentence. The
call number comes after any punctuation mark—such as a comma, semicolon,
or period—with the exception of a dash or a colon. In addition to citation to
authorities, a footnote may include textual sentences that are related to the
main text to which the footnote is appended.

> This is sentence one.' Sentence two contains two call numbers;
however, only one of these—this one?—is surprising. Recall one
thing‘: call numbers precede dashes and colons.

(b) Footnotes. If a footnote itself contains an assertion requiring support, a
citation to the relevant authority should appear directly after the assertion as
either a citation sentence or a citation clause.

(i) Citation sentences. Authorities that support (or contradict) an entire
footnote sentence are cited in a separate citation sentence immediately after
the sentence they support (or contradict). The citation sentence starts with a
capital letter and ends with a period.

(ii) Citation clauses. Authorities that support (or contradict) only part
of a sentence within a footnote are cited in clauses, set off by commas, that
immediately follow the proposition they support (or contradict).

(c) Example. The following excerpt illustrates the use of citation sentences and
clauses in a law review piece:

>» Some American jurisdictions place the burden of sustaining criminal
defenses on the accused.’ States have required defendants to prove

dant must even establish that a homicide was accidental.*

tions, and Burden of Proof in the Criminal Law, 88 YALE L.j. 1325,
1329-30 (1979). The authors point out that the use of affirmative
defenses may relieve the state of its duty to prove a sufficient factual
basis for punishment, id. at 1357, and argue that the reasonable doubt
standard should not be limited to those facts formally identified as
elements of the offense charged, id. at 1327.

pretense).

1.2 Introductory Signals
(a) Signals that indicate support.

[no signal] Cited authority (i) directly states the proposition, (ii) identifies the
source of a quotation, or (iii) identifies an authority referred to in the
text. Use no signal, for example, when directly quoting an authority
or when restating numerical data from an authority.

E.g., Cited authority states the proposition; other authorities also state
the proposition, but citation to them would not be helpful or is not
necessary. “E.g.,” may be used alone or attached to any other signal
(whether supportive or not). When it is attached to another signal, it
should be preceded by an italicized comma and followed by a non-
italicized comma.

See, e.g.,
But see, e.g.,

Accord “Accord” is commonly used when two or more sources state or
clearly support the proposition, but the text quotes or refers to only
one; the other sources are then introduced by “accord.” Similarly, the
law of one jurisdiction may be cited as being in accord with the law
of another.

See Cited authority clearly supports the proposition. “See” is used
instead of “(no signal]” when the proposition is not directly stated
by the cited authority but obviously follows from it; there is an
inferential step between the authority cited and the proposition it
supports.



============================================================
PAGE 83
============================================================

Structure and Use of Citations R1

Seealso _—_ Cited authority constitutes additional source material that supports
the proposition. “See also” is commonly used to cite an authority
supporting a proposition when authorities that state or directly
support the proposition already have been cited or discussed. The
use of a parenthetical explanation of the source’s relevance (rule 1.5)
following a citation introduced by “see also” is encouraged.

Cf. Cited authority supports a proposition different from the main
proposition but sufficiently analogous to lend support. Literally, “cf.”
means “compare.” The citation’s relevance will usually be clear to the
reader only if it is explained. Parenthetical explanations (rule 1.5),
however brief, are therefore strongly recommended.

(b) Signal that suggests a useful comparison.

Compare... Comparison of the authorities cited will offer support for or

[and]... illustrate the proposition. When used as a signal, “Compare” must
with... be used in conjunction with “with”; the “with” is preceded by a
[and]... ° comma, as is “and” when used. The relevance of the comparison will

usually be clear to the reader only if it is explained. Parenthetical
explanations (rule 1.5) following each authority are therefore
strongly recommended.

> Compare Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 121 (1989) (plurality
opinion) (rejecting the claim by a putative natural father of the. right
to visit his child conceived by a married woman), and CATHARINE A.
MACKINNON, FEMINISM UNMODIFIED 49 (1987) (contending that what
connects all women is their oppression in a sexual hierarchy), with
Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (invalidating laws prohibiting
interracial marriage), Doe v. McConn, 489 F. Supp. 76, 80 (S.D. Tex.
1980) (holding a cross-dressing ordinance unconstitutional as applied
to individuals undergoing therapy for sex-reassignment surgery),
and Kenneth L. Karst, The Freedom of Intimate Association, 89 YALE
L.J. 624, 631 (1980) (“The denial of the society of an intimate may
be partial, as in the case of a parent who loses a contest over child
custody but is allowed visitation rights, or virtually total, as when a
noncustodial parent is denied visitation rights.”).

(c) Signals that indicate contradiction.
Contra Cited authority directly states the contrary of the proposition.
“Contra” is used where “[no signal]” would be used for support.

But see Cited authority clearly supports a proposition contrary to the main
proposition. “But see” is used where “see” would be used for support.

But cf. Cited authority supports a proposition analogous to the contrary of
the main proposition. The use of a parenthetical explanation of the
source’s relevance (rule 1.5) following a citation introduced by “but
cf.” is strongly recommended.

“But” should be omitted from “but see” and “but cf.” whenever one of these
signals follows another negative signal:

> Contra Blake v. Kline, 612 F.2d 718, 723-24 (3d Cir. 1979); see CHARLES
ALAN WRIGHT, LAW OF FEDERAL Courts (STUDENTS EDITION) § 48 (4th

ed. 1983). Ce

(d) Signal that indicates background material.

See Cited authority presents helpful background material related to the

generally proposition. ‘The use of a parenthetical explanation of the source
material’s relevance (rule 1.5) following each authority introduced
by “see generally” is encouraged.

(e) Signals as verbs. In footnotes, signals may be used as the verbs of textual
sentences. When using signals in this way, include material that would
otherwise be included in a parenthetical explanation as part of the sentence
itself. Signals should not be italicized when used as verbs in textual sentences
(rule 2.1(d)).

Thus:

> See Christina L. Anderson, Comment, Double Jeopardy: The Modern
Dilemma for Juvenile Justice, 152 U. PA. L. REV. 1181, 1204-07 (2004)
(discussing four main types of restorative justice programs).

becomes:

> See Christina L. Anderson, Comment, Double Jeopardy: The Modern
Dilemma for Juvenile Justice, 152 U. Pa. L. REV. 1181, 1204-07 (2004),
for a discussion of restorative justice as a reasonable replacement for
retributive sanctions.

“Cf.” becomes “compare” and “e.g.” becomes “for example” when used in this
manner.

1.3 Order of Signals

When more than one signal is used, the signals (along with the authorities
they introduce) should appear in the order in which those signals are listed
in rule 1.2, When “e.g.,” is used in conjunction with another signal, the other
signal’s position in rule 1.2 should be used. Signals of the same basic type—__
supportive, comparative, contradictory, or background (rule 1.2(a)—(d))—
must be strung together within a single citation sentence and separated by
semicolons. Signals of different types, however, must be grouped in different
citation sentences. For example:

» See Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976) (per curiam);
cf. Palmer v. Ticcione, 433 F. Supp. 653 (E.D.N.Y. 1977) (upholding a
mandatory retirement age for kindergarten teachers). But see, e.g.,
Gault v. Garrison, 569 F.2d 993 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that a clas-
sification of public school teachers based on age violated equal
protection absent a showing of justifiable and rational state purpose).
See generally Comment, O’Neil v. Baine: Application of Middle-Level
Scrutiny to Old-Age Classifications, 127 U. PA. L. REV. 798 (1979) (advo-
cating a new constitutional approach to old-age classifications).

Within a citation clause (rule 1.1), however, citation strings may contain signals
of more than one type, separated by semicolons.


============================================================
PAGE 85
============================================================

Structure and Use of Citations ¢

Order of Authorities Within Each Signal
Authorities within each signal are separated by semicolons.

Authorities should be ordered in a logical manner. If one authority or several
authorities together are considerably more helpful or authoritative than the
other authorities cited within a signal, they should precede the others.

Authorities cited in short form are ordered as though cited in full.

Parenthetical Information

(a) Substantive information. Use parentheticals, as needed, to explain
the relevance of a particular authority to the proposition given in the text.
Parenthetical information is recommended when the relevance of a cited
authority might not otherwise be clear to the reader (see rule 1.2). Explanatory
information takes the form of a present participial phrase, a quoted sentence, or
a short statement that is appropriate in context.

(i) Phrases not quoting the authority. Explanatory parenthetical phrases
not directly quoting the authority usually begin with a present participle and
should never begin with a capital letter:

» See generally Akhil Reed Amar, Reports of My Death Are Greatly
Exaggerated: A Reply, 138 U. Pa. L. REV. 1651 (1990) (arguing that the
author and the two-tier theory of federal jurisdiction are still viable).

When a complete participial phrase is unnecessary in context, a shorter
parenthetical may be substituted:

» Such standards have been adopted to address a variety of environ-
mental problems. See, e.g., H.B. Jacobini, The New International Sani-
tary Regulations, 46 Am. }. INT’LL. 727, 727-28 (1952) (health-related
water quality); Robert L. Meyer, Travaux Préparatoires for the UNESCO
World Heritage Convention, 2 EARTH L.J. 45, 45-81 (1976) (conserva-
tion of protected areas).

You may omit extraneous words such as “the” unless doing so would cause
confusion.

(ii) Phrases quoting the authority. If, however, the parenthetical information
quotes one or more full sentences or a portion of material that reads as a full
sentence, it should begin with a capital letter and include appropriate closing
punctuation. Indicate any omissions in the quoted text according to rule 5.3(b).

» 3 Consequences of Changing U.S. Population: Hearing Before the H.
Select Comm. on Population, 95th Cong. 11 (1978) (statement of Dr.
David Birch) (“[T]here are more mayors of Rockville, Maryland, than
there are mayors of Detroit.”).

it....[Llet us present a competing ideology... .”).

must confront it... . [L]et us present a competing ideology... .”).

When directly quoting only a short phrase from an authority, follow rule 1.5
(a)(i):

> But see Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 264 (1984)
(explaining that the final judgment rule reduces the potential for
parties to “clog the courts” with a succession of time-consuming
appeals).

(b) Order of parentheticals within a citation. When a citation requires
multiple parentheticals, place them in the following order:

» (date) (degree-granting institution) (ProQuest) [hereinafter short
name] (en banc) (Lastname, J., concurring) (plurality opinion) (per
curiam) (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted)
(citations omitted) (quoting another source) (citing another source),
http://www.domainname.com (last visited) (explanatory parenthet-
ical), prior or subsequent history.

In citations to online sources that share the characteristics of a print source
such that they could be cited according to rule 18.2.1(b)(ii), the URL should
immediately precede the explanatory parenthetical.

In citations to online and internet sources that utilize archival tools, the archival
link should immediately follow the URL (rule 18.2.1(d)).

Note that explanatory parentheticals precede any citation of subsequent history
or other related authority (rule 1.6):

> Atl. Richfield Co. v. Fed. Energy Admin., 429 F. Supp. 1052, 1061-62
(N.D. Cal. 1976) (“[NJot every person aggrieved by administrative

Ifthe material cited quotes or cites two or more different sources, include all
sources in the order in which they were cited within one quoting or citing
parenthetical. For two sources, use the format “first...; and then...” for three
or more sources, use “first...; then...; and then...” such that “and then” is
always used for the last source.

Structure and Use of Citations R1

Related Authority 1.6

When citing a work, citations to related authorities may be helpful to aid in
locating the primary work or to provide relevant information not reflected in
the primary citation. Citations to related authority may be appended to the
primary citation with the use of an italicized explanatory phrase.

(a) Related authority intended to increase access.

(i) “In.” When citing a shorter work such as an article, essay, or speech
originally published in a volume collecting such works, use “in” to introduce the
collection as a whole (see rule 15.5):

> Kay Deaux & Brenda Major, A Social-Psychological Model of Gender, in
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL DIFFERENCES 89, 93 (Deborah
L. Rhode ed., 1992).

(ii) “Reprinted in.” A work that conveniently reprints a source originally
published elsewhere may be introduced by “reprinted in.” As far as possible,
provide a complete citation for the original work, followed by “reprinted in” and
the citation for the volume containing the reprint (see rule 15.5.2):

> Louis Loss, The Conflict of Laws and the Blue Sky Laws, 71 HARV. L. REV.
209 (1957), reprinted in Louis Loss & EDWARD M. CoweTT, BLUE SKY
LAW 180 (1958).

> Thomas Jefferson, Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799, reprinted in
4 THE DEBATES IN THE SEVERAL STATE CONVENTIONS ON THE ADOP-
TION OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION 540 (Jonathan Elliot ed., 2d ed.,
Philadelphia, J.B. Lippincott 1888).

To indicate excerpts or partial reprints, add the word “as”:

> S. REP. No. 95-181, at 14 (1977), as reprinted in 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3401,
3414,

(iii) Other phrases. Other phrases may be used by analogy to rule 1.6(a)(i)
and (ii), as appropriate (e.g., “microformed on” (see rule 18.5.1), or “translated
in” (see rule 20.2.5)).

(b) Relevant history. The prior or subsequent history of a case (rule 10.7) or
of a statute (rule 12.7) may be appended to the main citation for that case
or statute. See rules 10.7 and 12.7 for circumstances in which the subsequent
history of a case or statute must be indicated:

> Matthews v. Konieczny, 488 A.2d 5 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1985), rev’d, 527
A.2d 508 (Pa. 1987).

(c) Commentary. Works that discuss or quote the primary authority may also
be appended to the citation without parentheses as related authorities when
particularly relevant or when locating the original source may be difficult. Use
italicized phrases such as “noted in,” “construed in,” “quoted in,” “reviewed by,”
“cited with approval in,” and “questioned in” to introduce these works. Works
that the primary authority discusses, cites, or otherwise mentions, however,
should be indicated parenthetically. Thus:

2 TYPEFACES FOR LAW REVIEWS

Legal writing uses four typefaces, though choice of font may vary (e.g., Times
New Roman, Courier, etc.):

» Ordinary Roman (Plain Text)
> Underlined

> Italicized

> LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALS

Law reviews use two sets of typeface conventions—one for law review text
(either main text or footnote text) (rule 2.2) and one for law review citations
(rule 2.1). Unless otherwise noted, the examples in The Bluebook correspond to
the convention for law review footnotes.

For an explanation of the typeface conventions commonly used in other forms
of legal writing, see Bluepages B2. Practitioners can make ready use of the
examples in The Bluebook by substituting the typeface conventions outlined in
the Bluepages for those found in the examples throughout the rest of the book.

For example, a practitioner’s brief might look like this:

» Directors manage the business and affairs of a corporation. See
Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc., 506 A.2d 173,
179 (Del. 1986); see also Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 141(a) (2000). In Guth
v. Loft, the court held that directors also owe a duty of loyalty to the
shareholders. 5 A.2d 503, 510 (Del. 1939) (holding that directors’ duty
of loyalty demands that “there shall be no conflict between duty and
self-interest”).

A similar section of a law review article might read:

> Directors manage the business and affairs of a corporation.' In Guth
v. Loft, the court held that directors also owe a duty of loyalty to the
shareholders.”

>» 1 See Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc., 506 A.2d
173, 179 (Del. 1986); see also DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 141(a) (2000).

> 25 A.2d 503, 510 (Del. 1939) (holding that directors’ duty of loyalty
demands that “there shall be no conflict between duty and
self-interest”).

For additional guidance, see rule 2.1, rule 2.2, and Bluepages B2.

Typefaces for Law Reviews R2

Typeface Conventions for Citations 2.1
Most law reviews use three different typefaces in citations:

> Ordinary Roman (Plain Text), /talics, and LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALS
Some replace large and small capitals with ordinary roman type. Thus:

> Colin S. Diver, The Optimal Precision of Administrative Rules, 93 YALE
L.J. 65 (1983).

becomes:

> Colin S. Diver, The Optimal Precision of Administrative Rules, 93 Yale
LJ. 65 (1983).

Other law reviews replace some italics, as well as all large and small capitals,
with ordinary roman type:
> Colin S. Diver, The Optimal Precision of Administrative Rules, 93 Yale
LJ. 65 (1983).

The examples in this book follow the first convention, using all three typefaces.
‘The following list explains the more important typeface conventions used in
law review citations:

(a) Case names (rules 10.2, 14.3.1, 20.3, 21.5, and 21.6). Use ordinary roman
type for case names in full citations, except for procedural phrases, which are
always italicized:

> Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905).
> State ex rel. Scott v. Zinn, 392 P.2d 417 (N.M. 1964).
When a case name appears within an article title in a citation, do not italicize it:

> Thomas J. Madden et al., Bedtime for Bivens: Substituting the United
States as Defendant in Constitutional Tort Suits, 20 HARV. J. ON LEGIS.
469 (1983).

Use italics for the short form of case citations:
> Lochner, 198 U.S. at 50.

(b) Books (rule 15). Use large and small capitals for both authors and titles:
> RICHARD KLUGER, SIMPLE JUSTICE (1976).

(c) Periodicals (rule 16). Italicize article titles and use large and small capitals
for periodical names. Authors’ names should appear in ordinary roman type:

> Katherine K. Baker, Once a Rapist? Motivational Evidence and
Relevancy in Rape Law, 110 HARV. L. REV. 563 (1997).

> Cass R. Sunstein, Lochner’s Legacy, 87 COLUM. L. REV. 873 (1987).

> David E. Bernstein, Lochner’s Legacy’s Legacy, 92 Tex. L. REV. 1
(2003).

(d) Introductory signals (rule 1.2). Italicize all introductory signals when they
appear within citation sentences or clauses:

> See, e.g., Parker Drilling Co. v. Ferguson, 391 F.2d 581 (5th Cir. 1968).

Do not, however, italicize a signal word when it serves as the verb of an ordinary
sentence (rule 1.2(e)):

» Foran analysis of risk-allocation rules under the UCC, see Note, Risk of
Loss in Commercial Transactions: Efficiency Thrown into the Breach, 65
Va. L. REV. 557, 563-72 (1979).

(e) Explanatory phrases (rules 1.6, 10.7, and 12.8). Italicize all explanatory
phrases:

» Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126, 131 (2d Cir.) (en banc),
cert. denied, 439 U.S. 946 (1978). _

Note, however, that phrases in related authority parentheticals, such as
“(quoting ...),” “(citing ...),” and “(translating ...)” are not italicized.

(f) Punctuation. Italicize commas, semicolons, and other punctuation marks
only when they constitute part of the italicized material, and not when they are
merely an element of the sentence or citation in which they appear. For clarity,
the italicized items in the examples below appear in blue:

> See, e.g.,id.; Sabine Towing & Transp. Co. v. Zapata Ugland Drilling,
Inc. (in re M/V Vulcan), 553 F.2d 489 (Sth Cir.) (per curiam), cert.
denied, 434 U.S. 855 (1977).

» Nancy Reagan, Editorial, /ust Say “Whoa,” WALL ST. J., Jan. 23, 1996,
at A14.

Typeface Conventions for Textual Material

(a) Main text. The main text of law review pieces does not contain citations and
uses only ordinary roman type and italics. Most material appears in ordinary
roman type. Only the following are italicized:

(i) Case names. Italicize case names, including the “v.” and all procedural
phrases such as “In re” and “ex rel.”:

» Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada
(ii) Titles of publications, speeches, or articles. Thus:

» The library has a copy of The Path of the Law, which was published in
the Harvard Law Review; a complete set of the Federal Supplement;
and today’s Wall Street Journal. It does not have a copy of Hearings on
S. 776 or Alaska Statutes.

(iii) Style. Italicize words for emphasis or other stylistic purposes (rule 7). Also
italicize words that are emphasized in quoted matter (rule 5.2).

(b) Footnote text. Unlike in the main text, a sentence in footnote text may
contain citations, which are placed in citation clauses embedded in the sentence
(rule 1.1(b)).

(i) Case names. When a case name is grammatically part of the sentence in
which it appears, it should be italicized:


============================================================

============================================================

Typefaces for Law Reviews R2
> In Loving v. Virginia, the Court invalidated Virginia’s antimiscegena-
tion statute.

> In Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), the Court invalidated Virginia’s
antimiscegenation statute.

When the case name is not grammatically part of the sentence, but rather used
in a citation clause embedded in the footnote text, use the typeface conventions
for citations (rule 2.1(a)):

> The Court has upheld race-specific statutes that disadvantage a racial
minority, e.g., Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), but
those decisions have been severely criticized.

> Justice Harlan quipped that “one man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric,”
Cohen, 403 U.S. at 25, but failed to provide further explanation.

(ii) All other authorities. When referring to any other type of authority,
whether or not the reference is grammatically part of the sentence, use the
typeface conventions for citations if the full citation or a short form citation
(rule 4) is given:

> A different view is expressed in LEARNED HAND, THE BILL OF RIGHTS
(1958), and HOLMES, supra note 2.

If the reference appears without the full or shortened citation information,
follow the typeface conventions for the main text of law reviews (rule 2.2(a)

(ii):

> Judge Hand explained his philosophy of judicial review in The Bill of
Rights.

(iii) Explanatory parentheticals. In explanatory parentheticals, follow the
typeface convention for case names in citation text when a full citation clause
is included:

> Nat’| R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002) (citing
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984)).

> Nat’| R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002)
(addressing an argument based upon Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res.
Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984)).

> Nat’| R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002)
(addressing an argument based upon Chevron).

(c) Punctuation. Italicize commas, semicolons, etc., only when they constitute
part of italicized material, and not when they are merely an element of the
citation or sentence in which they appear. For purposes of clarity, the italicized
punctuation marks in the examples below appear in blue:

> When it decided Sabine Towing, the Fifth Circuit presented a some-
what different rationale for its holding.

SUBDIVISIONS

Most subdivisions (such as columns or sections) in citations are abbreviated.
See table 116 for a list of subdivision abbreviations.

Volumes, Parts, and Supplements

A single work often appears in separately paginated (or sectioned or
paragraphed) volumes, parts, or supplements. A citation to material that
appears in one such volume, part, or supplement must identify the separately
paginated subdivision in which the material appears.

(a) Volumes. When the volumes are numbered, cite the volume number in
Arabic numerals. If the author of the entire work (all volumes) is cited, the
volume number precedes the author’s name:

> 2 FREDERICK POLLOCK & FREDERIC WILLIAM MAITLAND, THE HISTORY OF
ENGLISH LAW 205-06 (2d ed. 1911).

» 2 SUBCOMM. ON LAB. OF THE S. COMM. ON LAB. & PuB. WELFARE, 92D
CONG., LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTU-
NITY ACT OF 1972, at 1007 (1972).

Otherwise, the volume number precedes the volume’s title:

» Donald H. Zeigler, Young Adults as a Cognizable Group in Jury Selec-
tion, 76 Micu. L. REV. 1045, 1047 (1978).

If no volume number is given but the volume is readily identifiable by year,
use the year of the volume as the volume number and omit the year after the
pincite:

>» Thomas R. McCoy & Barry Friedman, Conditional Spending: Federal-
ism’s Trojan Horse, 1988 Sup. CT. REV. 85, 88.

» Donald A. Dripps, Delegation and Due Process, 1988 DUKE L.}. 657.
Ifthe volume designation includes words, use brackets to avoid confusion:
> [1977-1978 Transfer Binder] Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) §] 66,472

If volumes are numbered in a new series each year, give both the year and
volume number, bracketing the year and placing it before the volume number
to avoid confusion:

> [1943] 2 K.B. 154


============================================================
PAGE 93
============================================================

Subdivisions

(b) Separately paginated numbered parts. When a work is divided into
separately paginated (or sectioned or paragraphed) series, books, chapters, or
other parts, include the relevant subdivisions in the citation:

> 26 ConG. REC. app. at 156 (1894) (statement of Rep. Hicks).
> ser. 14, pt. 2, at 150
> pt. 3,§4, at 15

(c) Supplements. When citing a separately paginated (or sectioned or
paragraphed) supplement, identify the supplement and its date in parentheses:

> Haw. REV. STAT. § 296-46.1 (Supp. 1984).

> GEORGE GLEASON BOGERT, THE LAW OF TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES § 496
(rev. 2d ed. Supp. 1985).

To cite both the main volume and the supplement, use an ampersand:

> 42U.S.C. § 1397b (1982 & Supp. 1 1983).

Pages, Footnotes, Endnotes, and Graphical Materials

(a) Pages. Give the page number or numbers before the date parenthetical,
without any introductory abbreviation (“p.” and “pp.” are used only in internal
cross-references (rule 3.5)):

> ARTHUR E. SUTHERLAND, CONSTITUTIONALISM IN AMERICA 45 (1965).
> H.R. REP. No. 82-353, at 4-5 (1951).

Use “at” if the page number may be confused with another part of the citation;
use a comma to set off “at.” Use this form, for example, when the title of a
work ends with an Arabic numeral or when the work uses Roman numerals
for pagination:

> BIOGRAPHICAL DIRECTORY OF THE GOVERNORS OF THE UNITED STATES
1978-1983, at 257 (Robert Sobel & John W. Raimo eds., 1983).

»> Thomas |. Emerson, Foreword to CATHARINE A. MACKINNON, SEXUAL
HARASSMENT OF WORKING WOMEN, at vii, ix (1979).

If an article, case, or other source within a larger source is not separately
paginated, cite the page on which the item begins: ~

> Bernard L. Diamond, The Psychiatric Prediction of Dangerousness, 123
U. PA. L. REV. 439 (1974).

> United States v. Bruno, 144 F. Supp. 593 (N.D. Ill. 1955).

>» Government Employees Training Act, Pub. L. No. 85-507, 72 Stat. 327
(1958).

When referring to specific material within such a source, include both the page
on which the source begins and the page on which the specific material appears
(a pincite), separated by a comma:

3.2

> Matthew Roskoski, Note, A Case-by-Case Approach to Pleading
Scienter Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 97
Mich. L. REV. 2265, 2271-75 (1999).

>» CATHARINE A. MACKINNON, On Exceptionality: Women as Women in
Law, in FEMINISM UNMODIFIED 70, 76-77 (1987).

When referring specifically to material on the first page of a source, repeat the
page number:

» Christina M. Fernandez, Note, Beyond Marvin: A Proposal for Quasi-
Spousal Support, 30 STAN. L. REV. 359, 359 (1978).
When citing material within a concurring or dissenting opinion, give only the
initial page of the case and the page on which the specific material appears, not
the initial page of the concurring or dissenting opinion:
> Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 297 (1962) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).

When citing material that spans more than one page, give the inclusive page
numbers, separated by an en dash (-) or hyphen (-). Always retain the last two
digits, but drop other repetitious digits:
» Edward L. Rubin, Note, Fairness, Flexibility, and the Waiver of Remedial
Rights by Contract, 87 YALE L.}. 1057, 1065-69 (1978).

If a hyphen or dash would be ambiguous because of the page numbering
system, use the word “to”:

>» Boris |. BITTKER & JAMES S. EUSTICE, FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION OF
CORPORATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS {| 5.06, at 5-31 to -32 (5th abr. ed.
1987).

Cite nonconsecutive pages by giving the individual page numbers separated
by commas:

> Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529, 531, 546 (1976).

If a source uses star paging (such as “*3”), drop the star in the ending page
number of a page range, but keep the star in all references to nonconsecutive
pages:

> 2 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *152, *155-56.

When a point is often repeated throughout the entire source, use “passim” rather
Pp P 8)
than citing specific pages. Do not insert a comma after the initial page number:

» Linda S. Mullenix, The Constitutionality of the Proposed Rule 23 Class
Action Amendments, 39 Ariz. L. REV. 615 passim (1997).

(b) Footnotes. To cite a footnote, give the page on which the footnote appears,
“n.,” and the footnote number, with no space between “n.” and the number:

» Akhil Reed Amar, The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
138 U. PA. L. REV. 1499, 1525 n.80 (1990).

To cite a footnote that spans more than one page, cite only the page on which
the footnote begins, “n.,” and the footnote number:


============================================================
PAGE 95
============================================================

Subdivisions ©

>» Akhil Reed Amar, The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
138 U. Pa. L. REV. 1499, 1560 n.222 (1990).

When referring only to specific pages of a footnote that spans more than one page,
cite only the specific pages, rather than the page on which the footnote begins:

» Akhil Reed Amar, The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
138 U. PA. L. REV. 1499, 1561-62 n.222 (1990).

To cite both a range of pages and also a single footnote that appears within the
page range, cite the page range followed by a comma and then cite the footnote
in the typical manner:

> Akhil Reed Amar, The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
138 U. PA. L. REV 1499, 1523-24, 1524 n.75 (1990).

Cite multiple footnotes (or endnotes) by using “nn.”:
» 141 nn.180-86

Treat nonconsecutive footnotes (or endnotes) like nonconsecutive pages, but
(except for internal cross-references) substitute an ampersand for the comma
separating two footnotes that appear on the same page or the final comma ina
list of three or more footnotes that appear on the same page:

> 350 n.12, 355 n.18
> 291nn.14 & 18, 316 nn.4, 6 & 8-9

To refer to both a page in the text and a footnote that begins on that page, use
an ampersand between the page and the note number:

> Irene Merker Rosenberg, Essay, Winship Redux: 1970 to 1990, 69 TEX.
L. REV. 109, 123 & n.90 (1990).

(c) Endnotes. To cite an endnote, give the page on which the endnote appears
(not the page on which the call number appears), “n.,”and the endnote number,
with no space between “n.” and the number:

> JOHN Hart ELy, DEMOCRACY AND DISTRUST 215 n.85 (1980).

To refer to both a page in the text and an endnote that has a call appearing on
that page, use an ampersand between the text page and the page on which the
endnote appears. In the following example, the cited text is on p. 61 and the
endnote is on p. 215:

> JOHN Hart ELy, DEMOCRACY AND DISTRUST 61 & 215 n.85 (1980).
Otherwise, cite endnotes in the same manner as footnotes.

(d) Graphical materials. When citing tables, figures, charts, graphs, or other
graphical materials, give the page number on which the graphical material
appears and the designation, if any, provided in the source, with no space
between the abbreviation and the number. Use the abbreviations in table T'16:

>» Kevin M. Clermont & Theodore Eisenberg, Commentary, Xenophilia in
American Courts, 109 HARV. L. REV. 1120, 1131 tbl.2 (1996).

> Jennifer Gerarda Brown & lan Ayres, Economic Rationales for Media-
tion, 80 Va. L. REV. 323, 397 fig.6 (1994).



============================================================
PAGE 96
============================================================

To refer to multiple charts, tables, figures, etc., on the same page, pluralize the
abbreviated designation according to table’T16. Use commas and ampersands,
not en dashes, to separate:

» Ofigs.3&4
> 1236 tbls.1, 2&3

3.3. Sections and Paragraphs

If an authority is organized by section (§) or paragraph (9), cite to those
subdivisions:

>» 15 U.S.C. § 18 (1982).

>» 6 JAMES WM. MOORE ETAL., MOORE’S FEDERAL PRACTICE ] 56.07 (3d
ed. 1997).

A page number may also be provided if useful in locating specific matter within
the section or paragraph:

> LAURENCE H. TRIBE, AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW § 15-4, at 1314,
§ 15-6, at 1320 (2d ed. 1988).

If an authority is organized in part by indented paragraphs not introduced by
paragraph symbols ({]/), do not cite such paragraphs with the symbol. Instead
use the written abbreviation (para.):

» THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE para. 2 (U.S. 1776).
Do not cite indented paragraphs if the authority is ordinarily cited by page:
» Mandela Trial Scheduled Today, USA Topay, Feb. 4, 1991, at A4.
Do not use “at” before a section or paragraph symbol:
> Id. §7.
Not: Id. at § 7.
> MOORE ETAL., supra note 5, 4] 56.07.
Not: MOORE ETAL., supra note 5, at 4 56.07.

Rule 6.2(c) discusses the use of section and paragraph symbols.

To cite session laws amending prior acts that are divided into sections within
sections, see rule 12.4(d).

(a) Subsections. If the source contains punctuation separating sections from
subsections, use the original punctuation:

> N.M. Stat. ANN. § 4-44-7(G) (1983).

Not: N.M. STAT. ANN. § 4(44)(7)(G) (1983).
If the source contains no such separating punctuation, separate the subsection

designations using parentheses, not decimals, hyphens, or other marks. Thus,
place “1” and “a” in parentheses (“(1)” and “(a)”).

(b) Multiple sections and subsections. When citing multiple sections, use two
section symbols (§§). Give inclusive numbers; do not use “et seq.” Identical


============================================================
PAGE 97
============================================================

Subdivisions

digits or letters preceding a punctuation mark may be omitted, unless doing so
would create confusion. Otherwise retain all digits.

> WASH. REV. CODE ANN. §§ 18.51.005-.52.900 (West 1989 & Supp.
1991).

> DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 9, §§ 817-819 (1989).

Note that letters are sometimes used to designate sections, rather than
subsections, and that section designations may contain punctuation within

them:

>» 42U.S.C. §§ 1396a—-1396d.
Ifan en dash or hyphen would be ambiguous, use the word “to”:

> 42U.S.C. §§ 1973aa-2 to -4.

> Mont. Cove ANN. §§ 75-1-301 to -324 (1989).
When citing scattered sections, separate the sections with commas:

> N.J. STAT. ANN. §§ 18A:54-1, -3, -6 (West 1989).
Repeat digits if necessary to avoid confusion:

> N.J. STAT. ANN. §§ 18A:58-17, 58-25, :64A-22.1, :64A-22.6 (West 1989).
When citing multiple subsections within a single section, use only one section
symbol:

> 28 U.S.C. § 105(a)(3)-(b) (1).

>» 19 U.S.C. § 1485(a) (1)-(3).

> DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 9, § 6910(a), (c) (1989).

But when citing multiple subsections within different sections, use two section

symbols:
> 19 U.S.C. §§ 1485(a), 1486(b).

(c) Multiple paragraphs. Multiple paragraphs should be treated like multiple
sections, following rule 3.3(b):

> 1Biu_e Sky L. REP. (CCH) 911 4471-4474.

> MooRE ETAL., Supra note 5, 1] 54.32-.35.
(d) Flush language and examples. When the source is organized by section
or paragraph, but the text being cited is flush language or an example, indicate

this fact in a parenthetical immediately following the section or paragraph
identifier, as follows:

> I.R.C. § 960(c) (flush language).
> Treas. Reg. § 1.704-2(m) (example 1(ii)).

Appended Material

Indicate an appendix or appended note or comment by placing the appropriate
abbreviation (see table’T'16) after the citation to the largest full subdivision to which
the item is appended, whether page, section, paragraph, chapter, title, or volume:

Other types of appended material that serve as commentary on the material to
which they are appended, or that further discuss a point related to the textual
discussion, should be cited as notes or appendices:

> Feb. R. Civ. P. 60(b) advisory committee’s note to 1946 amendment.

>» RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF PROP. § 2.1 cmt. ¢, illus. 2 (AM. LAW INST.

Disrupters).

> N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law § 624 note (McKinney 1963) (Legislative Studies

STANLEY D. HENDERSON, CASES AND COMMENTS ON CONTRACTS app.
1, at 942 (5th ed. 1988).

Internal Cross-References

Portions of text, footnotes, and groups of authorities within the piece may be
cited using “supra” or “infra.” Use supra to refer to material that has already
appeared within the piece. Use infra to refer to material that appears later in the
piece. Always retain the last two digits, but drop other repetitious digits.

Use a consistent naming convention for subdivisions that are numbered or
otherwise designated in the piece (The Bluebook suggests using “Part” for main
subdivisons and “Section” for all smaller subdivisions); use “note” to refer to
footnotes within the same piece; use “p.” and “pp.” to refer to other pages within
the same piece; use “Figure” and “Table” to refer to figures and tables within the
same piece. A variety of forms may be used. For example:

» See supra text accompanying notes 305-07.

» See supra notes 12-15, 92-97 and accompanying text.
» See cases cited supra note 22.

» But see sources cited supra note 24.

» See discussion infra Sections II.B.2, IlI.C.1.

(see rule 4.2).

SHORT CITATION FORMS

This rule provides general guidance for all short forms. For guidance as to
specific short forms see the following rules:

Cases ‘ a ae rule 10.9
Constitutions. ee ; rule 11
Statutes a rule 12.10
Legislative Materials rule 13.8

For additional guidance on the use of short forms in court documents and legal
memoranda, see Bluepages B4, B10.2, B12.2, B15.2, B16.2, B17.2, and B18.2.

“Id.”

“Id.” may be used in citation sentences and clauses for any kind of authority
except internal cross-references (as described in rule 3.5). In court documents
and legal memoranda, use “id.” when citing the immediately preceding
authority, but only when the immediately preceding citation contains only one
authority. In law review footnotes, use “id.” when citing the immediately
preceding authority within the same footnote or within the immediately
preceding footnote when the preceding footnote contains only one authority. Note
that the period at the end of “id.” is always italicized.

Indicate where a subsequent citation varies from the former, such as the specific
page number being cited. If the first citation refers only to a shorter work
contained within an authority, do not use “id.” for a subsequent citation to the
entire authority. Instead, use the “supra” form (see rule 4.2(a)).

The following examples illustrate the use of “id.” to refer to a variety of
commonly cited materials:

“Supra” and “Hereinafter” 4.2

“Supra” and “hereinafter” may be used to refer to legislative hearings; court
filings; books; pamphlets; reports; unpublished materials; nonprint resources;
periodicals; services; treaties and international agreements; regulations,
directives, and decisions of intergovernmental organizations; and internal
cross-references. “Supra” and “hereinafter” should not be used to refer to cases,
statutes, constitutions, legislative materials (other than hearings), restatements,
model codes, or regulations, except in extraordinary circumstances, such as
when the name of the authority is extremely long:

» 26 In re Multidistrict Private Civ. Treble Damage Antitrust Litig. Involving
Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Equip., 52 F.R.D. 398 (C.D. Cal.
1970) [hereinafter Air Pollution Control Antitrust Case].

Appropriate short forms for cases, statutes, and legislative materials (other than
hearings) are provided in their respective rules.

(a) “Supra.” When an authority has been fully cited previously, the “supra”
form may be used (unless “id.” is appropriate or “supra” is inappropriate for that
authority). The “supra” form generally consists of the last name of the author of
the work, followed by a comma and the word “supra.” Indicate any particular
manner in which the subsequent citation differs from the former.

If the author is an institutional author, use the full institutional nanie. If no
author is cited, use the title of the work; for unsigned student-written law
review materials, use the appropriate designation (see rule 16.7.1(b)).

Indicate the footnote in which the full citation can be found, unless the full
citation is in the same footnote, in which case “supra” should be used without
any cross-reference. Indicate any particular manner in which the subsequent
citation differs from the former. Volume, paragraph, section, or page numbers
may be added to refer to specific material:

FIED, supra note 33, at 46, 47.

(b) “Hereinafter.” For authority that would be cumbersome to cite with the
usual “supra” form or for which the regular shortened form may confuse the
reader, the author may establish a specific shortened form. After the first
citation of the authority, but before any explanatory parenthetical, place the
word “hereinafter” and the shortened form in brackets. The shortened form
should appear in the same typeface as in the full citation. In subsequent
citations, cite the authority using the shortened form followed by a comma and
the appropriate “supra” cross-reference (rule 4.2(a)):

Quotations

QUOTATIONS

Formatting of Quotations
(a) Quotations of fifty or more words.

(i) Indentation and quotation marks. The quotation should be indented on
the left and right without quotation marks, and quotation marks within a block
quotation should appear as they do in the original:

> [T]his presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our historic
commitment to the rule of law. This is nowhere more profoundly mani-
fest than in our view that “the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is that
guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.” We have elected to employ
an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all
issues before a court of law.... The ends of criminal justice would be
defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative
presentation of the facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and
public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts,
within the framework of the rules of evidence. To ensure that justice is
done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process
be available for the production of evidence needed either by the prosecu-
tion or by the defense.

United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 708-09 (1974) (second alteration in
original) (citation omitted). The Court then balanced this interest against
the evils of forced disclosure. /d. at 710.

(ii) Footnote and citation placement. In law review text (in which citations
are not permitted), the footnote number should appear after the final
punctuation of the quotation. In law review footnotes, court documents, and
legal memoranda (in which citations are permitted), the citation should not be
indented but should begin at the left margin on the line immediately following
the quotation. In law review footnotes, where the quotation is placed within a
parenthetical, it should be enclosed in quotation marks and not otherwise set
off from the rest of the text.

(iii) Paragraph structure. The paragraph structure of an indented quotation
should be indicated by further indenting the first line of each paragraph. The
first sentence of the first quoted paragraph is only indented, however, if the first
word of the quoted passage is also the first word of a paragraph in the source
being quoted. If language at the beginning of the first paragraph is omitted, do
not indent the first line or use an ellipsis. To indicate omission at the beginning
of subsequent paragraphs, insert and indent an ellipsis. Indicate the omission of
one or more entire paragraphs by inserting and indenting four periods (“....”)
on a new line. The following example illustrates these rules:

> On appeal to the federal courts via a habeas petition, McCleskey
alleged that Georgia’s capital sentencing process was administered
in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. McCleskey based his claims
ona study, conducted by respected law and economics Professors

a .
; Quotations

Baldus, Pulaski, and Woodworth .... The Baldus study examined
roughly 2,500 murder cases....

... Professors Baldus, Pulaski, and Woodworth also subjected
their data to an extensive statistical analysis.

(b) Quotations of forty-nine or fewer words. .

(i) Indentation and quotation marks. The quotation should be enclosed in
quotation marks but not otherwise set off from the rest of the text. Quotation
marks around material quoted inside another quote should appear as single
marks within the quotation in keeping with the standard convention.

(ii) Footnote and citation placement. The footnote number or citation should
follow immediately after the closing quotation mark unless it is more accurate
to place it elsewhere shortly before or after the quotation.

(iii) Paragraph structure. Do not indicate the original paragraph structure of
quotations of forty-nine or fewer words except when the material quoted would
commonly be set off from the text, such as lines of poetry or dialogue from a
play. In this case, the quotation may appear as a block quote per rule 5.1(a)(i),
regardless of its length.

(iv) Punctuation. Always place commas and periods inside the quotation
marks; place other punctuation marks inside the quotation marks only if they
are part of the original text.

5.2 Alterations and Quotations Within Quotations

(a) Substitution of letters or words. When a letter must be changed from
upper to lower case, or vice versa, enclose it in brackets. Substituted words or
letters and other inserted material should also be bracketed:

> “[P]ublic confidence in the [adversary] system depend[s upon]
full disclosure-of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of
evidence.”

(b) Omission of letters. Indicate the omission of letters from a common root
word with empty brackets (“judgment[]”).

(c) Mistakes in original. Significant mistakes in the original should be
followed by “[sic]” and otherwise left as they appear in the original:

» “This list of statutes are [sic] necessarily incomplete.”
(d) Changes to citations.

(i) Use a parenthetical clause after the citation to indicate when the source
quoted contains any addition of emphasis, alteration to the original in the
quoted text, or any omission of citations, emphasis, or footnote call numbers.
When a citation requires multiple parentheticals, place them in the order
indicated in rule 1.5(b):

» “The fact that individuals define themselves in a significant way

through their sexual relationships suggests ... that much of the rich-
84 ; oo
ness of a relationship will come from the freedom to choose the form

and nature of these intensely personal bonds.” Bowers v. Hardwick,
478 U.S. 186, 205 (1986) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (second emphasis
added).

>» The court of appeals recognized the city’s substantial interest
in limiting the sound emanating from the bandshell. The court
concluded, however, that the city’s sound-amplification guideline
was not narrowly tailored to further this interest, because “it has not
[been] shown ... that the requirement of the use of the city’s sound
system and technician was the least intrusive means of regulating the
volume.”

Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 797 (1989) (alteration in
original) (citation omitted).

(ii) Do not indicate the omission of a citation or footnote call number that
follows the last word quoted.

(iii) Do not indicate that emphasis in the quotation appears in the original.

(e) Quotations within quotations. Whenever possible, a quotation within
a quotation should be attributed to its original source. Insert a parenthetical
following any parenthetical required by rule 5.2(d):

> Chief Judge J. Skelly Wright noted Congress’s “firm resolve to insure
that the CIA’s ‘power that flows from money and stealth’ could not be
turned loose in domestic investigations of Americans.” Marks v. CIA,
590 F.2d 997, 1008 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (Wright, C.J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (emphasis added) (quoting Weissman v. CIA, 565
F.2d 692, 695 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).

Note that sources included in parentheticals pursuant to this rule should be
formatted as though they appear in citation clauses (see rules 2.1 and 2.2(b)

(iii).
(f) Internal quotation marks.

(i) Internal quotation marks should be omitted if the opening mark appears at
the very beginning of an in-line quotation and the closing mark appears at the
very end.

> Original: If “the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construc-
tion of the statute,” that is the end of the matter.

> The dispositive question is whether “the agency’s answer is based on
a permissible construction of the statute.”

Not: The dispositive question is whether “‘the agency’s answer is based
ona permissible construction of the statute.’”

(ii) Do not omit multiple levels of nested marks except as this rule allows,
even though “quoting” parentheticals beyond the first level may be omitted
under rule 10.6.3. Alternate between double and single quotation marks as
appropriate.

> Original: In this context, “the distinction between ‘jurisdictional’ and
‘non-jurisdictional’ interpretations is a mirage.”

Quotations

> The Court noted that, “[i]n this context, ‘the distinction between “juris-
dictional” and “non-jurisdictional” interpretations is a mirage.”

Not: The Court noted that, “[i]n this context, ‘the distinction between
jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional interpretations is a mirage.’”

(iii) Do not fail to include a “quoting” parenthetical because this rule requires
omission of internal quotation marks (rather, omit “quoting” parentheticals only
as allowed by rule 10.6.3).

(iv) Do not omit internal quotation marks in block quotations.

Omissions

Omission of a word or words is generally indicated by the insertion of an
ellipsis, three periods separated by spaces and set off by a space before the
first and after the last period (“.*.*.*”), to take the place of the word or words

omitted. Note that “*” indicates a space.

An ellipsis should never be used to begin a quotation, nor should it be used
when individual words are merely altered (rules 5.1(a)(iii) and 5.2).

(a) When using quoted language as a phrase or clause. Do not indicate
omission of matters before or after a quotation:

> Chief Justice Burger wrote that the availability of compulsory process
is “imperative to the function of courts” and that “[t]he very integrity
of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on
full disclosure of all the facts.”

However, indicate omission of matter within such a phrase or clause with an
ellipsis:
> Chief Justice Burger wrote that the availability of compulsory process
is “imperative toe.e.e.e courts” and that “[t]hee.°.°.e judicial system
and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all
the facts.”

(b) When using quoted language as a full sentence. For example, assume the
text of the original language is as follows:

» National borders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than
at almost any other time in history. As economic activity continues
its relentless drive toward world-wide scope, trademarks become
even more important. Why, then, are certain scholars advocating
less comprehensive trademark protection? In fact, this seems
counterintuitive.

(i) Where the Zeginning of the quoted sentence is being omitted, capitalize the
first letter of the quoted language and place it in brackets if it is not already
capitalized:

» “[Blorders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than at
almost any other time in history.”

(ii) Where the middle of a quoted sentence is omitted, insert an ellipsis where
the language is omitted:


============================================================
PAGE 107
============================================================

Abbreviations, Numerals, and Symbols Ro

> “National borders are less of a barriere.*.°.enow than at almost any
other time in history.”

(iti) Where the end of a quoted sentence is omitted, insert an ellipsis between
the last word being quoted and the final punctuation of the sentence being
quoted:

» “National borders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than
at almost any other timee.e.°.°.”

(iv) Do not indicate the deletion of matter after the period or other final
punctuation that concludes the last quoted sentence.

> “National borders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than
at almost any other time in history.”

(v) Where language after the end of a quoted sentence is deleted and is followed
by further quotation, retain the punctuation at the end of the quoted sentence
and insert an ellipsis before the remainder of the quotation.

> “National borders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now
than at almost any other time in history.e.°.°.°[E]conomic activity
continues its relentless drive toward world-wide scope, [so] trade-
marks become even more important.” ,

(vi) Iflanguage both at the end and after the end of a quoted sentence is omitted
and followed by further quoted material, use only one ellipsis to indicate both
of the omissions:

» “National borders are less of a barriere.°.°.°.e[EJconomic activity
continues its relentless drive toward world-wide scope, [So] trade-
marks become even more important.”

Note that the punctuation at the end of the first sentence should follow the
ellipsis:

» “Why, then, are certain scholars advocating lesse.°.°.°? [T]his seems
counterintuitive.”

(c) When omitting a footnote or citation. Indicate omission of a footnote or a
citation with the parenthetical phrase “(footnote omitted)” or “(citation omitted)”
immediately following the citation to the quoted source. Do not insert an
ellipsis for an omitted footnote or citation.

ABBREVIATIONS, NUMERALS, AND SYMBOLS 6

Abbreviations 6.1

Tables at the end of this book contain lists of specific abbreviations for arbitral
reporters (15), case names, institutional author names, and periodical titles
(T6), court names (T’7), explanatory phrases (T'8), legislative documents (T9),



============================================================

============================================================

- Abbreviations, Numerals, and Symbols

geographical terms (‘T'10), judges and officials (T'11), months (‘T12), periodicals
(113), publishing terms (T'14), services (T'15), and subdivisions (T16).

Abbreviations not listed in this book should be avoided unless substantial space
will be saved and the resulting abbreviation is unambiguous.

Note that in legal writing the same word may be abbreviated differently for
different uses:

> F. and Fed.
> app. and App’x

(a) Spacing. In general, close up all adjacent single capitals:
> NW.
>» S.D.N.Y.

But do not close up single capitals with longer abbreviations:
» D. Mass.
> S. Ct.

In abbreviations of periodical names (see tables I’6 and T13), close up all
adjacent single capitals except when one or more of the capitals refers to the
name of an institutional entity, in which case set the capital or capitals referring
to the entity off from other adjacent single capitals with a space. Thus:

>» GEO. L.J.

» B.C. L. Rev.
> NLY.U. L. REv.
> S. IL. U. Lf.

Individual numbers, including both numerals and ordinals, are treated as single
capitals:

>» F.3d
> S.E.2d
>» A.L.R.4th

But, insert a space adjacent to any abbreviation containing two or more letters:

> So. 2d
> Cal. App. 3d
> F. Supp. 2d

Close up initials in personal names:
> W.C. Fields

(b) Periods. Generally, every abbreviation should be followed by a period,
except those in which the last letter of the original word is set off from the rest
of the abbreviation by an apostrophe. Thus:

>» Ave.


============================================================

> Bldg.

But:

>» Ass’n

>» Dep’t
Some entities with widely recognized initials, e.g., AARP, CBS, CIA, EPA, FCC, FDA,
FEC, NAACP, and NLRB, are commonly referred to in spoken language by their
initials rather than by their full names; such abbreviations may be used without
periods in text, in case names, and as institutional authors. Do not, however,

omit the periods when the abbreviations are used as reporter names, in names
of codes, or as names of courts of decision. Thus:

> NLRB v. Baptist Hosp., Inc., 442 U.S. 773 (1979).
But: E. Belden Corp., 239 N.L.R.B. 776 (1978).

United States may be abbreviated to “U.S.” only when used as an adjective (do
not omit the periods):

» U.S. history
But: history of the United States

In addition to the abbreviation “U.S.,” always retain periods in abbreviations
not commonly referred to in speech as initials (e.g., N-Y., S.D.).

Numerals and Symbols

(a) Numerals. In general, spell out the numbers zero to ninety-nine in text
and in footnotes; for larger numbers, use numerals. This general rule is subject,
however, to the following exceptions:

(i) Any number that degins a sentence must be spelled out.

(ii) “Hundred,” “thousand,” and similar round numbers may be spelled out, if
done consistently.

(iii) When a series includes numbers both less than 100 and greater than or
equal to 100, numerals should be used for the entire series:

> The plaintiffs gained, respectively, 117, 6, and 28 pounds.
(iv) Numerals should be used if the number includes a decimal point.

(v) Where material repeatedly refers to percentages or dollar amounts,
numerals should be used for those percentages or amounts.

(vi) Numerals should be used for section or other subdivision numbers.

(vii) In numbers that appear in text and citations, use commas to separate
groups of three digits when those numbers contain four or more uninterrupted

digits. Thus:
» 1,234,567

Do not employ this convention in citations to pages, statutes, volume numbers,
internet database locators, docket numbers, the U.S. Code, or other sources
whose classification systems do not themselves include commas:

6.2

Italicization for Style and in Unique Circumstances

» United States v. Walker, No. 00-40098, 2003 WL 131711 (D. Kan. Jan. 6,
2003).

(b) Ordinals.

(i) Unless part of a citation, ordinal numbers appearing in text and footnotes
are controlled by rule 6.2(a). If part of a citation, numerals are used for all
ordinal numbers. Do not use superscripts:

>» Aist Leg.
>» 4th ed.

(ii) In textual sentences, where rule 6.2(a) requires that the numeral be used,
use “2nd” or “3rd” for figures representing ordinal numbers ending in two or
three. But, in citations, for figures representing ordinal numbers ending in the
number two or three, use “2d” or “3d,” not “2nd” or “3rd.” Do not use superscripts
in any case. Thus:

» The 102nd Congress could not pass a rule that would bind the 103rd
Congress.

But, in citations:
» 103d Cong.
» 2ded.

(c) Section (§) and paragraph ({) symbols. The first word of any sentence
must be spelled out. In addition, spell out the words “section” and “paragraph”
in the text (whether main text or footnote text) of law review pieces and
other documents, except when referring to a provision in the U.S. Code (see
rule 12.10(c)) or a federal regulation (see rule 14.5). In citations, the symbols
should be used (except when citing session laws amending prior acts as noted
in rule 12.4(d)). When the symbols are used, insert a space between “§” or “”
and the numeral. See rules 3.3(b) and 3.3(c) when citing to multiple sections
or paragraphs.

(d) Dollar ($) and percent (%) symbols. These symbols should be used
wherever numerals are used, and the words should be spelled out wherever
numbers are spelled out, but a symbol should never begin a sentence. There
should not be a space between “$” or “%” and the numeral.

ITALICIZATION FOR STYLE
AND IN UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES

See rule 2 for a general discussion on the uses of typefaces. The conventions
below apply to italicization for emphasis, italicization of foreign words and
phrases, and italicization in other unique circumstances.

(a) Emphasis. Words and phrases may be italicized for emphasis.

(b) Foreign words and phrases. Italicize non-English words and phrases
unless they have been incorporated into common English usage. Latin words


============================================================
PAGE 111
============================================================

Capitalization (

and phrases that are often used in legal writing are considered to be in common
English usage and should not be italicized. However, very long Latin phrases
and obsolete or uncommon Latin words and phrases should remain italicized.
For example:

> expressio unius est exclusio alterius
» ignorantia legis neminem excusat
» sero sed serio

» exdolo malo non oritur actio

But:

P e.g. > i.e.

» res judicata » quid pro quo
> amicus curiae > certiorari

> corpus juris > ab initio

> obiter dictum » de jure

> modus operandi » habeas corpus
> non obstante veredicto > prima facie _
> mens rea » en banc

Note, however, that “id.” is always italicized. Note also that other typeface rules
may control. For example, when “e.g.” is used as a signal it should be italicized
as per rule 2.1(d). Similarly, always italicize procedural phrases in case names,
such as “In re” or “ex rel.,” under rule 10.2.1(b).

(c) Letters representing hypothetical parties, places, or things. Italicize and
capitalize individual letters when used to represent the names of hypothetical
parties, places, or things:

>» Awentto bank Bin state X.

(d) The lowercase letter “1.” Italicize the lowercase letter “7” when used as a
subdivision, as in a statute or rule, to distinguish it from the numeral “1”:

> §23()
> cmt. |

(e) Mathematical expressions. Italicize mathematical formulas and variables:
> E=mc?

» ar2b

CAPITALIZATION 8

(a) Headings and titles. Capitalize words in a heading or title, including the
initial word and any word that immediately follows a colon. Do not capitalize
articles, conjunctions, or prepositions when they are four or fewer letters, unless
they begin the heading or title, or immediately follow a colon.



============================================================
PAGE 112
============================================================

Capitalization

(b) Internet main page titles and URLs. In both text and footnotes, capitalize
URLs and words in an internet main page title in accordance with the actual
capitalization of the source.

(c) Text. Except for headings, titles, and internet main page titles and URLs,
capitalize according to this rule. When this rule does not address a particular
question of capitalization, refer to a style manual such as the Chicago Manual
of Style or the U.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual. Practitioners
should also refer to Bluepages B8 for further advice on capitalization.
Additional words that should be capitalized in legal writing include:

(i) Nouns that identify specific persons, officials, groups, government
offices, or government bodies. These words and phrases should always be
capitalized according to the following examples:
» the Social Security Administrator
The plaintiff was declared disabled by the Social Security Adminis-
trator and was awarded benefits.
» the Administrator
For fifty years, the statute has provided that the Administrator make all
necessary determinations.
> the FDA
The FDA has approved the salts as safe and effective.

> the Agency
The Agency reported that all areas of the country met the standard for
nitrogen dioxide.

» Congress
Members of Congress are immune from false imprisonment claims
under certain circumstances.

» the President

A sitting President’s executive power allows him or her to pardon
convicted criminals.

But:

> the congressional hearings
The congressional hearings were held on the potential cumulative
effects of these three rules.
» the presidential veto
The presidential veto does not confer such power upon the President.
(ii) Exceptions. Certain words are exceptions to the above rule and should be
capitalized according to the following rules:

Act Capitalize when referring to a specific legislative act:

» Aunion has a statutory duty of fair representation
under the National Labor Relations Act.

Case Names

The only significant differences between case names in textual sentences and
case names in citations are the italicization (rule 2) and the extent to which
the case name is abbreviated. The provisions of rule 10.2.1 apply to every case
name, whether in text or citations, but case names in citations are further
abbreviated according to rule 10.2.2. Thus:

Cases

> In Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205 (1917), Justice McReyn-
olds stressed the value of uniform laws.

» Southern Pacific also indicates the breadth of federal lawmaking
power under the admiralty jurisdiction.

Not: In S. Pac. Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205 (1917), Justice McReynolds
stressed the value of uniform laws.

But: in citations:
> See, e.g., S. Pac. Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 225-26 (1917) (Pitney, J.,
dissenting).

Note that the examples throughout rule 10.2 employ the typeface conventions for
law review citations. For an explanation of typeface conventions, see rule 2. For
typeface conventions in court documents and legal memoranda, see Bluepages B2.

General Rules for Case Names

Use the case name that appears at the beginning of the opinion in the cited
reporter as modified by the paragraphs below. If no name appears in the cited
reporter, use a popular name or cite as “Judgment of <date»”:

> Shelley’s Case
>» Judgment of Oct. 11, 2008

Always retain in full the first word in each party’s name (including a relator)
except as provided below. In extremely long case names, omit words not
necessary for identification; the running head (the short identifier printed at
the top of each page of the case) may serve as a guide. Make the following
modifications where applicable:

(a) Actions and parties cited. If the case is a consolidation of two or more
actions, cite only the first listed:

> Shelley v. Kraemer
Not: Shelley v. Kraemer, McGhee v. Sipes

Omit all parties other than the first listed on each side. Do not omit the first-
listed relator or any portion of a partnership name:

> Fry v. Mayor of Sierra Vista
Not: Fry v. Mayor & City Council of Sierra Vista
But:

» Massachusetts ex rel. Alison v. Pauly
> Eisen v. Spradlin, Lincoln & Amorosi

Omit words indicating multiple parties, such as “et al.” Also omit alternative
names given for the first-listed party on either side:

> Cheng v. Seinfeld
Not: Cheng et al. v. Seinfeld d/b/a The Man, Inc.

10.2.1



============================================================
PAGE 118
============================================================

Similarly, for in rem jurisdiction cases, omit all but the first-listed item or group
of items:

> In re Three Pink Cadillacs
Not: In re Three Pink Cadillacs, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear
Tree

Where real property is a party, use its common street address, if available:

> United States v. 6109 Grubb Road
Not: United States v. Parcel of Real Property Known as 6109 Grubb Road,
Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania

In bankruptcy and similar cases, the case name might contain both an adversary
and a nonadversary name. If both appear at the beginning of the opinion, cite
the adversary name first, followed by the nonadversary name in parentheses.
Include a procedural phrase such as “In re” or “ex rel.” before the nonadversary
name, followed by a descriptive or introductory phrase such as “Estate of” or
“Interest of,” if any. If only an adversary name or only a nonadversary name
appears at the beginning of the opinion, cite the name supplied:

> Wallingford’s, Inc. v. Waning (In re Waning), 120 B.R. 607, 611 (Bankr.
D. Me. 1990).

> In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Grp., Inc., 120 B.R. 724 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.
1990).

> In re Estate of Benson, No. C7-95-2185, 1996 WL 118367 (Minn. Ct. App.
Mar. 19, 1996).

» State v. Powers (/n re Interest of Powers), 493 N.W.2d 166 (Neb. 1992).

(b) Procedural phrases. Abbreviate “on the relation of,” “for the use of,” “on
behalf of,” “as next friend of,” and similar expressions to “ex rel.” Abbreviate “in
the matter of,” “petition of,” “application of,” and similar expressions to “In re.”
Omit all procedural phrases except the first. When adversary parties are named,
omit all procedural phrases except “ex rel.”:

>» Gorman v. Bruh
Not: Jn re Gorman v. Bruh
But:

» Massachusetts ex rel. Kennedy v. Armbruster
» Ex parte Young

Include any introductory or descriptive phrases such as “Accounting of,” “Estate
of,” and “Will of.” Thus:

> In re Will of Holt
> Estate of Haas v. Commissioner

Procedural phrases should always be italicized, regardless of whether the rest of
the case name is italicized. Thus, in law review text:

» Ex parte Young


============================================================
PAGE 119
============================================================

Cases

(c) Abbreviations. In textual sentences, whether in main text or in footnote
text, abbreviate only widely known acronyms under rule 6.1(b) and these eight
words: “&,” “Ass'n,” “Bros.,” “Co.,” “Corp.,” “Inc.,” “Ltd.,” and “No.” If one of
these eight begins a party’s name, however, do not abbreviate it.

> Philadelphia Electric Co. v. Hirsch

Not: PECO v. Hirsch

But: NAACP v. Kaminski
For abbreviations in citations, see rule 10.2.2.

(d) “The.” Omit “The” as the first word of a party’s name, except as part of the
name of the object of an in rem action or in cases in which “The King” or “The
Queen” is a party. Thus:

> Miami Herald v. Sercus

But:

> Inre The Clinton Bridge
> The King v. Broadrup

Do not omit “The” in an established popular name, except when referring to the
case textually. Thus:

> See The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883).

But: Neither of the Civil Rights Cases opinions was correct.

Not: Neither of The Civil Rights Cases opinions was correct.
(e) Descriptive terms. Omit terms such as “administrator,” “appellee,”
“executor,” “licensee,” and “trustee” that describe a party already named:

> Burns v. McMillen

Not: Burns v. McMillen, Administrator

But: Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Garodnick
(£) Geographical terms. Omit “State of,” “Commonwealth of,” and “People of,”
except when citing decisions of the courts of that state, in which case only
“State,” “Commonwealth,” or “People” should be retained:

> Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299 (1990).

Not: Blystone v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299 (1990).

But: Commonwealth v. Ferrone, 448 A.2d 637 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1982).
Omit “City of,” “County of,” “Village of,” “Township of,” and like expressions
unless the expression begins a party name:

> Mayor of New York v. Clinton

Not: Mayor of the City of New York v. Clinton

But: Butts v. City of New York
Omit all prepositional phrases of location not following “City,” or like

expressions, unless the omission would leave only one word in the name of
a party or the location is part of the full name of a business or similar entity:



============================================================
PAGE 120
============================================================

100

> Surrickv. Board of Wardens .
Not: Surrick v. Board of Wardens of the Port of Philadelphia
But: Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey

Not: Planned Parenthood v. Casey
» Shapiro v. Bank of Harrisburg

Include designations of national or larger geographical areas except in union
names (rule 10.2.1(i)). Omit “of America” after “United States”:

> Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran
» United States v. Aluminum Co. of America

Retain all geographical designations not introduced by a preposition:
> Billman v. Indiana Department of Corrections

Omit all geographical designations that follow a comma:

> City of Arlington v. FEC
Not: City of Arlington, Texas v. FEC

(g) Given names or initials. Generally, omit given names or initials of
individuals, but not in names of business firms or where a party’s surname is
abbreviated:

> Courtney v. Sandman
Not: Paul Vincent Courtney v. Joseph M. Sandman
But:
> Tanya Bartucz, Inc. v. Virginia J. Wise & Co.
> Linda R.S. v. Richard D.
Do not omit any part of a surname made up of more than one word:
> Van der Velt v. Standing Horse
> Abdul Ghani v. Subedar Shoedar Khan

Given names that follow a surname should be retained. Thus, retain the full
name where the name is enéirely in a language in which the surname is given
first, such as Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese:

>» Yao Zhen Guang v. Yeh Zhi An

>» Chow v. Ha Quang Jin
Not: Timothy Chow v. Ha Quang Jin

Similarly, if a party’s name is of Spanish or Portuguese derivation, cite the
surname and all names following:

» Ortega y Gasset v. Alcala de Larosa

If in doubt, use the name under which the party appears in the index of the
reporter cited.


============================================================
PAGE 121
============================================================

Cases

(h) Business firm designations. Omit “Inc.,” “Ltd.,” “L.L.C.,” “N.A.,” “F.S.B.,”
and similar terms if the name also contains a word such as “Ass’n,” “Bros.,”
“Co.,” “Corp.,” “Ins.,” or “R.R.,” clearly indicating that the party is a business firm:
> Wisconsin Packing Co. v. Indiana Refrigerator Lines, Inc.
Not: Wisconsin Packing Co., Inc. v. Indiana Refrigerator Lines, Inc.

This rule should be read narrowly. The omission of the business firm
designation is appropriate only if the name of the business could not possibly be
mistaken for the name of some other entity, such as a natural person.

(i) Union and local union names. Cite a union name exactly as given in
the official reporter. This general rule is subject, however, to the following
exceptions:

(i) Only the smallest unit should be cited:

> NLRB v. Radio & Television Broadcast Engineers Local 1212

Not: NLRB v. Radio & Television Broadcast Engineers Local 1212, IBEW,
AFL-CIO

(ii) All craft or industry designations, except the first fu// such designation,
should be omitted:

> Douds v. Local 294, International Brotherhood of Teamsters

Not: Douds v. Local 294, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauf-
feurs, Warehousemen & Helpers

But: International Union of Doll & Toy Workers v. Local 379

(iii) A widely recognized abbreviation of the union's name (e.g., UAW) may be
used in accordance with rules 6.1(b) and 10.2.1(c).

(iv) All prepositional phrases of location, including those of national or larger
areas, should be omitted.

(j) Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Cite simply as “Commissioner” or, in
citations, “Comm’r.”

(k) Common names different from name in reporter. For cases not known
by the name that appears in the reporter, but known instead by a common
name, the common name must either be substituted for the reporter name in
its entirety, or indicated parenthetically in the same typeface as the case name
in the reporter:

> The Brig Amy Warwick (The Prize Cases), 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635 (1863).

> The Prize Cases, 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635 (1863).

Not: The Prize Cases (The Brig Amy Warwick), 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635
(1863).

For cases known by the name in the reporter, but a/so commonly known by a
short name different from that appearing in the reporter, the common name
may nofbe substituted for the reporter name in its entirety in a full citation, but
it may be indicated parenthetically in italics:

R10



============================================================
PAGE 122
============================================================

> Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (Steel Seizure), 343 U.S. 579
(1952).
Not: Steel Seizure, 343 U.S. 579 (1952).
Similarly, for mandamus actions against courts where the case is known by the

name of the judge against whom the writ is sought, the name may be indicated
parenthetically in italics:

> United States v. U.S. District Court (Keith), 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

And, for cases with multiple dispositions, a helpful identifier of the number of
the decision may be indicated parenthetically in italics:

> Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (Hamdi I//, 316 F.3d 450 (4th Cir. 2003).

‘This parenthetical identifier is given only when a case is cited as the primary
citation. Once given, the parenthetical identifier alone may be used as the case
name when the case is cited again, even in circumstances where a full citation
would otherwise be required:

> 'Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC (Fox 1), 280 F.3d 1027 (D.C. Cir.),
modified on reh’g, 293 F.3d 537 (D.C. Cir. 2002).

> ?Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC (Fox Ii), 293 F.3d 537, 540 (D.C. Cir.
2002) (quoting Fox /, 280 F.3d at 1043).

In conformity with rule 2.1(f), when citing cases according to the above rule,
the parentheses themselves should never be italicized in either main text or
footnote text.

10.2.2 Additional Rules for Case Names in Citations

Cite case names in citations according to the rules given above, but with the
following further modifications:

Always abbreviate any word listed in table T6, even if the word is the first
word in a party’s name, unless the word is part of a state, country, or other
geographical unit that is the entire name of the party:

> S. Consol. R.R. v. Consol. Transp. Co.
> In re Acad. Answering Serv., Inc.

> McGaugh v. Comm’r
But: South Dakota v. Dole
Not: S, Dakota v. Dole
Abbreviate states, countries, and other geographical units as indicated in table

T10 unless the geographical unit is the entire name of the party (as opposed to
just a part thereof). This includes “United States.” Thus:

> In re W. Tex. Pepper Co.

> LeBeau v. Univ. of Md.
But: Staub v. District of Columbia



============================================================
PAGE 123
============================================================

> Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Stud. v. U.S. Dep’t of Just.
But: Alvarez-Machain v. United States

But: Fritz v. County of Los Angeles

Abbreviate other words of eight letters or more if substantial space is thereby
saved and the result is unambiguous.

Reporters and Other Sources

Parallel Citations and Which Source(s) to Cite

‘The federal and state jurisdictions table (table’I'1) indicates which reporters to
cite for the decisions of most courts. Note that many state court decisions are
published in two or more sources.

(a) Parallel citations in state court documents. In documents submitted to
state courts, all case citations must be to the source(s) required by local rules.
Many state rules require that citations to state court decisions include a citation
to the official state reporter, followed by a parallel citation to a regional reporter.
Thus, these local rules, and vos the citation rules set forth in table Tl, govern
state court filings. See Bluepages B10.1.3 and Bluepages table BT 2.2 for
further guidance concerning jurisdiction-specific citation rules.

(b) Case citations in all other documents. In all other documents, including
ordinary legal memoranda and law review pieces, cite the relevant regional
reporter, if the decision is found therein. For example:

> Swedloff v. Phila. Transp. Co., 187 A.2d 152 (Pa. 1963).

If the decision is available as an official public domain citation (also referred to
as medium-neutral citation), that citation must be provided, as well as a parallel
citation to the regional reporter, if available.

If the decision is not found in a regional reporter or available as a public domain
citation, cite the other sources indicated in table T'1. Cite decisions of unlisted
courts as you would those of courts listed in the table. If a case is not available
in an official or preferred unofficial reporter or as a public domain citation,
cite another unofficial reporter, a widely used computer database (rule 18.3), a
service (rule 19), a slip opinion (rule 10.8.1(b)), an internet source (rule 18.2.2),
or a newspaper (rule 16.6), in that order of preference:

» United States v. Carlisle, No. 90-2465SI, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 5863, at
*3 (8th Cir. Apr. 10, 1991) (per curiam).

Reporters

Bound publications that print only cases (or cases and annotations) are
considered reporters and are cited in roman type. A citation to a reporter
consists of a volume designation (rule 3.1), the abbreviated name of the
reporter (as shown in table’I‘l), and the page on which the case report begins
(rule 3.2). For rules on spacing in reporter abbreviations, see rule 6.1(a).

> Burt v. Rumsfeld, 322 F. Supp. 2d 189 (D. Conn. 2004).

Early American reporters were often named after their editors rather than after
the courts whose cases they reported. Subsequently, official editor-named series
have been combined into jurisdiction-named series with continuous volume
numbering. Such reporters are now generally cited by the official series name
and number only; the name of the reporter's editor is omitted:

> Cobb v. Davenport, 32 N.).L. 369 (Sup. Ct. 1867).
Not: Cobb v. Davenport, 3 Vroom 369 (Sup. Ct. 1867).

However, for United States Supreme Court reporters through 90 U.S. (23
Wall.) and a few early state reporters (see table’I'1.3), give the name of the
reporter’s editor and the volume of that series. If the pagination of the official
jurisdiction-named reprints and the original reporters is the same, use the
following form:

» Green v. Biddle, 21U.S. (8 Wheat.) 1 (1823).
» Hall v. Bell, 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843).

If the pagination differs, give parallel citations to the reprints and the original
reporters:

» Wadsworth v. Ruggles, 23 Mass. 63, 6 Pick. 63 (1828).

Some very early Pennsylvania federal and state court decisions are reported in
the initial volumes of the United States Reports. Where such reporting occurs,
include the cite to “U.S.,” along with a parallel cite to the appropriate lower
court reporter:

» Barnes’s Lessee v. Irwin, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 199, 1 Yeates 221 (Pa. 1793).

» United States v. Fries, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 515, 9 F. Cas. 826 (C.C.D. Pa.
1799) (No. 5126).

Public Domain Format

When citing a decision available in public domain format (also referred to
as medium-neutral format), if the jurisdiction’s format can be cited in the
following form (see table Tl), provide the case name, the year of decision, the
state’s two-character postal code, the table ’T'7 court abbreviation (unless the
court is the state’s highest court), the sequential number of the decision, and,
if the decision is unpublished, a capital “U” after the sequential number of the
decision. When referencing specific material within the decision, a pinpoint
citation should be made to the paragraph number at which the material
appears. If available, a parallel citation to the appropriate regional reporter must
be provided.


============================================================

============================================================

Cases

The following examples are representative of the recommended public domain
citation format:

> Beck v. Beck, 1999 ME 110, 4] 6, 733 A.2d 981, 983.

> Gregory v. Class, 1998 SD 106, 4] 3, 584 N.W.2d 873, 875.

> Jones v. Fisher, 1998 OK Civ. App. 120U.

If a jurisdiction adopts a public domain format that differs from the above, the
requirements of the jurisdiction's format should be observed (table TI):

> Cannon v. Am. Bowling Cong., 94-0647, p. 1 (La. 4/29/94); 637 So. 2d
463, 463.

> Morton v. New Orleans Police Dep’t, 96-1799 (La. App. 4 Cir. 2/5/97);
687 So. 2d 699.

> Sullivan v. State, 98-KA-00521-SCT (4] 23) (Miss. 1999).

> State v. Brennan, 1998-NMCA-176, 4] 7, 126 N.M. 389, 970 P.2d 161.

Court and Jurisdiction 10.4

Every case citation must indicate which court decided the case. In American
and other common law citations, give the name of the court and its geographical
jurisdiction (abbreviated according to tables T1 or T2 if included therein and
according to tables T’7 and T'10 in all other cases) in the parenthetical phrase
that immediately follows the citation and includes the date or year of decision.
For court names that include ordinals, format and abbreviate the ordinals in
accordance with rule 6.2(b):

> Commonwealth v. Virelli, 620 A.2d 543 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992).
> United States v. Andolschek, 142 F.2d 503 (2d Cir. 1944).

For citations to foreign cases, see rule 20.3 and table’T'2.
A more detailed court designation than those specified by the following
paragraphs may be given if necessary.

(a) Federal courts. In citations to United States Law Week, the United States
Supreme Court is indicated with “U.S.” In citations to the Supreme Court
Reporter and the United States Reports, omit the Supreme Court’s name. When
a Supreme Court Justice sits on a lower court in his or her capacity as a Circuit
Justice, cite the decision as:

> Redden v. Interstate Com. Comm’n, 956 F.2d 302 (Thomas, Circuit
Justice, D.C. Cir. 1992).

United States courts of appeals for numbered circuits, regardless of year, are
indicated as:

> 2d Cir.

Not: C.C.A.2d

Not: CA2 —
When citing the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

Circuit and its predecessors, or when citing the Federal Circuit, use the
following abbreviations:



============================================================
PAGE 126
============================================================

“Pape Cases

> D.C. Cir.
> Fed. Cir.
For district court cases, give the district but not the division:
» DLN).
» D.D.C.
> C.D. Cal.
Not: C.D. Cal. E.D.
Cite the old circuit courts (abolished 1912):
> C.C.S.D.N.Y.
> C.C.E.D. Mo.
Cite the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation:
> J.P.M.L.
Cite the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and Court of Review:
> FISA Ct.
> FISA Ct. Rev.
Cite decisions of bankruptcy courts and bankruptcy appellate panels:
> Bankr. E.D. Va.
> B.A.P. 9th Cir.

(b) State courts. In general, indicate the state and court of decision. However,
do not include the name of the court if the court of decision is the highest court
of the state:

> People v. Armour, 590 N.W.2d 61 (Mich. 1999).

Not: People v. Armour, 590 N.W.2d 61 (Mich. Sup. Ct. 1999).
Omit the jurisdiction and/or the court abbreviation if unambiguously conveyed
by the reporter title:

> DiLucia v. Mandelker, 493 N.Y.S.2d 769 (App. Div. 1985).

Not: DiLucia v. Mandelker, 493 N.Y.S.2d 769 (N.Y. App. Div. 1985).

> Dubreuil v. Witt, 830 Conn. App. 410 (2003).
Not: Dubreuil v. Witt, 80 Conn. App. 410 (App. Ct. 2003).

Thus, when a decision is rendered by the highest court in a particular
jurisdiction and the name of the reporter is the same as the name of that
jurisdiction, neither the name of the court nor the name of the state need be
given:

> Bates v. Tappan, 99 Mass. 376 (1868).

Do not indicate the department, district, or county in citing decisions of
intermediate state courts unless that information is of particular relevance:

> Schiffman v. Corsi, 50 N.Y.S.2d 897 (Sup. Ct. 1944).



============================================================
PAGE 127
============================================================

When the department, district, or county is of particular relevance, that
information should be indicated as follows:

> Schiffman v. Corsi, 50 N.Y.S.2d 897 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 1944).
> Lee v. Perez, 120 S.W.3d 463 (Tex. App. 14th 2003).

Date or Year

(a) Decisions published in reporters. If possible, provide the year of decision;
use the year of the term of the court only if the year of decision is unavailable. In
ambiguous cases, follow the year given in the running head (at the top of each
page) in the reporter. Before Volume 108 of the U.S. Reports (1882), opinions
do not usually list their date of decision but rather list only the term in which
they were decided. For the dates of these opinions, refer to the Librarian of
the Supreme Court’s list of dates, available at http://www.supremecourt.gov
/opinions/datesofdecisions.pdf.

(b) Decisions published in other sources. Give the exact date for all
unreported cases and for all cases cited to a looseleaf service, a slip opinion, an
electronic database, or a newspaper:

> Bedell v. Nessim, No. 90-567, slip op. 3458 (1st Cir. Jan. 19, 1991).

Per rule 10.5(a), the exact date is mot necessary for cases that are labeled
“unpublished” but are nevertheless reported, including cases reported in the
Federal Appendix and “unpublished” cases reported in the appropriate reporter
for the jurisdiction:

> United States v. Tando, 68 F. App’x 85 (9th Cir. 2003).

(c) Pending cases and cases dismissed without opinion. Use the date or
year of the most recent major disposition. “Major dispositions” include
only: the initial filing, whether in the trial court or on appeal (e.g., “filed,”
“appeal docketed,” “petition for cert. filed”), oral argument (“argued”), and, for
cases dismissed without opinion, the dismissal (“dismissed”). Indicate the
significance of the date within a parenthetical phrase, unless its significance is
explained elsewhere:

> Bedell v. Nessim, No. 90-567 (1st Cir. argued Jan. 10, 1991).
Otherwise no special notation is necessary:

> Bedell v. Nessim, 725 F. Supp. 1407 (D. Mass. 1990), appeal docketed,
No. 90-567 (1st Cir. Dec. 20, 1990).

(d) Multiple decisions within a single year. When citing a case with several
different decisions in the same year, include the year only with the last-cited
decision in that year:

> United States v. Eller, 114 F. Supp. 284 (M.D.N.C.), rev’d, 208 F.2d 716
(4th Cir. 1953).

However, if the exact date of decision is required in either case, include both
dates:

> DiNapoli v. Ne. Reg’| Parole Comm’n, 764 F.2d 143 (2d Cir. 1985), peti-
tion for cert. filed, 54 U.S.L.W. 3146 (U.S. Aug. 29, 1985) (No. 85-335).

10.6 Parenthetical Information Regarding Cases

10.6.1 Weight of Authority

(a) Generally. Information regarding the weight of the authority (e.g., en banc;
in banc; 2-1 decision; mem.; per curiam; Brandeis, J.; unpublished table decision)
may be added in a separate parenthetical phrase following the date of decision:

> Webb v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 57 F.3d 1067 (4th Cir. 1995) (unpub-
lished table decision).

When a case is cited for a proposition that is not the single, clear holding of a
majority of the court (e.g., alternative holding; by implication; dictum; dissenting
opinion; plurality opinion; holding unclear), indicate that fact parenthetically:

> Parker v. Randolph, 442 U.S. 62, 84 (1979) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

» Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 570 (1985)
(5-4 decision) (Powell, J., dissenting).

Information regarding related authority (rule 1.6) or prior or subsequent
history (rule 10.7.1(a)) that can properly be indicated with an explanatory
phrase (table T8) should not be given parenthetically. Thus:

> Wersba v. Seiler, 393 F.2d 937 (3d Cir. 1968) (per curiam).

But: Wersba v. Seiler, 263 F. Supp. 838, 843 (E.D. Pa. 1967), aff’d per
curiam, 393 F.2d 937 (3d Cir. 1968).

(b) “Mem.” and “per curiam.” The abbreviation “mem.” stands for the word
“memorandum” and should be used in a parenthetical if, and only if, a court
disposition was issued without an opinion. District court and other opinions
denominated “memorandum decision” are not designated “mem.” in citations.
The phrase “per curiam” refers to an opinion issued “by the court” as an
institution as opposed to a decision issued by a particular judge. “Per curiam”
is used in a parenthetical to describe an opinion so denominated by the court.

(c) Seriatim opinions. Prior to the Marshall Court (which began February
4, 1801), the U.S. Supreme Court followed the traditional British practice of
each Justice writing his own opinion rather than producing a majority opinion
for the Court. To cite such an opinion, include the parenthetical “(opinion of
Lastname, J.).”

10.6.2 In-Chambers Opinions

When a Supreme Court Justice rules on a stay, bail, or injunction application,
he or she makes that decision “in-chambers” as a “surrogate” of the whole
Court. Only a few of those decisions result in written opinions, and they have
been published in the U.S. Reports only since Volume 396 in 1969. To cite such
an opinion, include the parenthetical “(Lastname, J., in chambers)”.

(a) Pre-1969 opinions. These have been gathered by Cynthia Rapp and
published in a multi-volume set, In Chambers Opinions by the Justices of the
Supreme Court of the United States, that also includes the opinions written after
ED 1969. Some of the pre-1969 cases did appear in the U.S. Reports, so that should



============================================================
PAGE 129
============================================================

Cases R10

be consulted first. Use this source and format only for opinions that cannot be
found in the U.S. Reports.

» Sacco v. Massachusetts, 1 Rapp 16 (1927) (Holmes, J., in chambers).

(b) U.S. Reports. Since 1969, these opinions have been included in the U.S.
Reports.

> Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers).

Quoting/Citing Parentheticals in Case Citations 10.6.3

When a case cited as authority itself quotes or cites another case for that point,
a “quoting” or “citing” parenthetical is appropriate. Within the parenthetical, the
same rules regarding typeface, pincites, and short forms apply to the quoted or
cited authority as if it were the direct source:

> Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 719 (2001) (Kennedy, J., dissenting)
(citing Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206
(1953)).

Note, however, that only one level of recursion is required. Thus, if a case quotes
a case that itself quotes another case, only one level of “quoting” or “citing”
parentheticals is necessary. An additional level of parenthetical information
may be used if the information conveyed is particularly relevant.

Order of Parentheticals 10.6.4

Parenthetical phrases should be placed in the following order: (i) weight

of authority parentheticals; (ii) “quoting” and “citing” parentheticals; (iii)

explanatory parentheticals. For more detailed information, see rule 1.5(b).
us:

> Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 47 (1949) (Rutledge, J., dissenting)
(rejecting the Court’s conception of the exclusionary rule), aff’g 187
P.2d 926 (Colo. 1947), overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961).

If an explanatory parenthetical contains text that itse/f requires a “quoting” or
“citing” parenthetical, the two parentheticals should be nested:

» Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 409 (2002) (“[T]he statutory criterion
for confinement embodied in the statute’s words ‘mental abnormality
or personality disorder’ satisfied ‘““substantive” due process require-
ments.’” (quoting Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 356 (1997))).

> Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 519 (1980) (Marshall, J., concur-
ring) (noting that conventional strict scrutiny is “strict in theory, but
fatal in fact” (citing Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265,
362 (1978))).

Prior and Subsequent History 10.7

Whenever a decision is cited in full, give the entire subsequent history of the
case, but omit denials of certiorari or denials of similar discretionary appeals,
unless the decision is less than two years old or the denial is particularly
relevant. Omit also the history on remand or any denial of a rehearing, unless 109



============================================================
PAGE 130
============================================================

Cases

10.7.1

relevant to the point for which the case is cited. Finally, omit any disposition
withdrawn by the deciding authority, such as an affirmance followed by reversal
on rehearing. Thus:

> Cent. ill. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Westervelt, 342 N.E.2d 463 (ill. App. Ct.
1976), aff’d, 367 N.E.2d 661 (Ill. 1977).

Not: Cent. Ill. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Westervelt, 342 N.E.2d 463 (Ill. App. Ct.
1976), aff’d, 367 N.E.2d 661 (Ill. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1070 (1978).

> Cheng v. GAF Corp., 631 F.2d 1052 (2d Cir. 1980), vacated, 450 U.S. 903
(1981).

Not: Cheng v. GAF Corp., 631 F.2d 1052 (2d Cir. 1980), vacated, 450 U.S.

903, remanded to 659 F.2d 1058 (2d Cir. 1981).

Give prior history only if significant to the point for which the case is cited or if
the disposition cited does not intelligibly describe the issues in the case, as in a
Supreme Court “mem.” Give separate decisions of other issues in the case with
their prior and subsequent history only if relevant.

Explanatory Phrases and Weight of Authority
A partial list of explanatory phrases (as abbreviated) appears in table TS.

(a) Prior or subsequent history. Append the prior or subsequent history of a
case to the primary citation. Introduce and explain each prior or subsequent
decision with italicized words between each citation:

> Cooper v. Dupnik, 924 F.2d 1520, 1530 & n.20 (9th Cir. 1991), rev’d en
banc, 963 F.2d 1220 (9th Cir. 1992).

Ifa subsequent disposition occurred in the same year as the primary citation,
omit the year from the primary citation’s parenthetical.

If subsequent history itself has subsequent history, append the additional
subsequent history with another explanatory phrase. For example, in the
following case the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit, which had
reversed the Southern District of New York:

>» Herbert v. Lando, 73 F.R.D. 387 (S.D.N.Y.), rev’d, 568 F.2d 974 (2d Cir.
1977), rev'd, 441 U.S. 153 (1979).

To show both prior and subsequent history, give the prior history first:

> Kubrick v. United States, 581 F.2d 1092 (3d Cir. 1978), aff’g 435 F. Supp.
166 (E.D. Pa. 1977), rev’d, 444 U.S. m1 (1979).

Citations to prior or subsequent history should follow any parenthetical
information given for the primary citation (rule 1.5(b)).

(b) Significance of disposition. Give the reason for a disposition if the
disposition does not carry the normal substantive significance:

» vacated as moot,

» appeal dismissed per stipulation,


============================================================
PAGE 131
============================================================

(c) Overruled, abrogated, and superseded cases. Also note cases that
have been overruled, abrogated, or superseded by statute or constitutional
amendment:

(i) Overruled cases. Indicate cases where a later decision by the same court (or
a court with appellate jurisdiction over the original court) explicitly repudiates
its earlier decision with the phrase “overruled by”:

> Nat’l League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), overruled by Garcia
v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528 (1985).

Also, when one case is overruled by multiple subsequent decisions by the same
court (i.e., separate decisions overrule separate parts of the holding), include
“and” in italics between the citations to each of the overruling cases:

> Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928), overruled by Katz v.
United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), and Berger v. New York, 388 U.S.
41 (1967).

(ii) Abrogated cases. Cases that are effectively (but not explicitly) overruled
or departed from by a later decision of the same court are indicated with the
phrase “abrogated by”:

> Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U.S. 188 (1948), abrogated by Braden v. 30th Jud.
Cir. Ct., 410 U.S. 484 (1973).

(iii) Cases superseded by statute or constitutional amendment. When citing
cases where a statute or amendment was enacted with the specific intent of
reversing the outcome of the initial case, the statute or amendment must always
be cited, and a later case recognizing such may be cited for support, as long as
the later case is decided by the same court (or a court with appellate jurisdiction
over the original court) as the superseded case:

» Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989), superseded by
statute, Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, as
recognized in Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44 (2003).

> Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), superseded by
constitutional amendment, U.S. CONST. amend. XIV.

Statutes cited according to this rule should be cited to the session laws
(rule 12.4) wherever possible and, if appropriate, specific sections of the statute
superseding the case may be cited.

(d) Multiple dispositions. Multiple dispositions by the same court following a
primary case citation should be connected with the word “and” in italics:

> United States v. Baxter, 492 F.2d 150 (9th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 414
U.S. 801 (1973), and cert. denied, 416 U.S. 940 (1974).

Different Case Name on Appeal

(a) Name changes in subsequent history. When the name of a case differs
in subsequent history, the new name must be given, introduced by the phrase
“sub nom.”:

> Great W. United Corp. v. Kidwell, 577 F.2d 1256 (5th Cir. 1978), rev’d
sub nom. Leroy v. Great W. United Corp., 443 U.S. 173 (1979).

10.7.2



============================================================
PAGE 132
============================================================

10.8

10.8.1

This rule applies even when the difference in the name is slight, such as a
change in only the procedural phrases:

> Padilla ex rel. Newman v. Rumsfeld, 243 F. Supp. 2d 42 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d
in part, rev’d in part sub nom. Padilla v. Rumsfeld, 352 F.3d 695 (2d Cir.
2003), rev’d, 542 U.S. 426 (2004).

(b) Name changes in prior history. To indicate a different name in prior
history, use the following form:

> Rederi v. Isbrandtsen Co., 342 U.S. 950 (1952) (per curiam), aff’g by an
equally divided court \sbrandtsen Co. v. United States, 96 F. Supp. 883
(S.D.N.Y. 1951).

(c) Exceptions. Do not provide a different case name (i) when the parties’
names are merely reversed; (ii) when the citation in which the difference
occurs is to a denial of certiorari or rehearing; (iii) when, in the appeal of an
administrative action, the name of the private party remains the same; or (iv)
when the change is simply stylistic (e.g., “State” to “California”:

> United Dairy Farmers Coop. Ass’n, 194 N.L.R.B. 1094, enforced, 465
F.2d 1401 (3d Cir. 1972).

But: Perma Vinyl Corp., 164 N.L.R.B. 968 (1967), enforced sub nom. U.S.
Pipe & Foundry Co. v. NLRB, 398 F.2d 544 (5th Cir. 1968).

Special Citation Forms

Pending and Unreported Cases

(a) Cases available on electronic media. When a case is unreported but
available on a widely used electronic database, it may be cited to that database.
Provide the case name, docket number, database identifier, court name, and
full date of the most recent major disposition of the case. Cite to the docket
number of a case as it appears on court documents. However, an initial digit
preceding a colon and a judge’s initials at the end of the docket number may be
omitted. Do not omit any other letters or numbers in the case docket number.

If the database contains codes or numbers that uniquely identify the case (as
do LEXIS, Westlaw, and Bloomberg Law), these must be given. Screen or
page numbers, if the database assigns them, should be preceded by an asterisk;
paragraph numbers, if assigned, should be preceded by a paragraph symbol:

> Gibbs v. Frank, No. 02-3924, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 21357, at *18-19 (3d
Cir. Oct. 14, 2004).

If the name of the database is not clear from the database identifier, include it
parenthetically at the end of the citation:

> Staats v. Brown, No. 65681-9, 2000 WA 0042007, ¥| 25 (Wash. Jan. 6,
2000) (VersusLaw).

Citations to cases that have not been assigned unique database identifiers
should include all relevant information, such as the specific collection within
the database in which the case can be found:

> Frankel v. Banco Nacional de Mex., S.A., No. 82 Civ. 6547 (S.D.N.Y. May
31, 1983) (LEXIS, Genfed Library, Dist. File).

> Lindquist v. Hart, 1 CA-CV 98-0323 (Ariz. Ct. App. July 15, 1999)
(Loislaw, Ariz. Case Law).

(b) Cases available in slip opinions. When a case is unreported but available
in a separately printed slip opinion, give the docket number, the court, and the
full date of the most recent major disposition of the case:

> Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters., No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.
30, 1977).

Note any renumbering of the docket:

> United States v. Johnson, 425 F.2d 630 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. granted,
403 U.S. 956 (1971) (No. 577, 1970 Term; renumbered No. 70-8, 1971
Term).

Always give the full docket number:
> No. 75-31
Not: No, 31

If the date given does not refer to the date of decision and the significance
of the date is not indicated elsewhere, indicate that significance within the
parenthetical containing the date:

> Ross v. Weissman, No. 90-345 (D. Mass. filed Sept. 18, 1990).
To cite a particular page of a separately paginated slip opinion, use the form:
> Ross v. Weissman, No. 90-345, slip op. at 6 (D. Mass. Dec. 4, 1990).

If the case is not separately paginated, cite the page on which the case begins as
well as the page on which the particularly cited material appears:

> Bedell v. Nessim, No. 90-567, slip op. 3458, 3465 (1st Cir. Jan. 19,
1991).

In pending or unreported adversary proceedings.in bankruptcy, supply both the
case number of the underlying nonadversary proceeding and the case number

of the adversary proceeding:

> Brown v. Sachs (/n re Brown), Ch. 7 Case No. 84-00170-G, Adv. No.
85-1190, slip op. at 5 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 24, 1986).

(c) Other pending and unreported cases. Cases that are not available in
slip opinions or on electronic databases may be cited to services (rule 19),
periodicals (rule 16), or the internet (rule 18.2.2).



============================================================
PAGE 134
============================================================

(d) Depublished cases. A number of jurisdictions allow their decisions to be
“depublished,” usually when review is denied, and generally without a reported
order. When there is no reported order depublishing the lower court decision,
the fact that the case was depublished should be indicated parenthetically:

> Mitchell v. Cal. Fair Plan Ass’n, 260 Cal. Rptr. 3 (Ct. App. 1989)
(depublished).

If the order depublishing a case is reported, the order should be indicated as
subsequent history pursuant to rule 10.7, introduced with the explanatory
phrase “depublished by.”

10.8.2 Fifth Circuit Split

On October 1, 1981, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
was divided to create the new Fifth and Eleventh Circuits. Cite cases decided
during the transitional period leading to this reorganization according to
the following rules: (i) cite decisions rendered in 1981 and labeled “Sth Cir.”
by month; (ii) give unit information whenever available; and (iii) designate as
“Former Sth Cir.” any nonunit judgment labeled as a Former Fifth judgment and
rendered after September 30, 1981:

> Birlv. Estelle, 660 F.2d 592 (5th Cir. Nov. 1981).
> Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Smith, 676 F.2d 1023 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982).

> Trailways, Inc. v. ICC, 676 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir. Unit A Aug. 1981) (per
curiam).

> McCormick v. United States, 680 F.2d 345 (Former 5th Cir. 1982).

10.8.3 Briefs, Court Filings, and Transcripts

Citation for a petitioner’s brief in a U.S. Supreme Court case:

]

docket number commercial database
identifier (optional)

In general, all court filings follow the same general form. The full name of the
document, as it appears on the filing, must come first, abbreviated according to
rule 10.2.1(c), followed by a pinpoint citation, if any. The full case citation and
the docket number should follow the name of the document and the pinpoint
citation. If no decision has yet been rendered on the filing cited, cite the case
according to rule 10.5(c), but the date in the parenthetical should be the date
on which the filing was made, regardless of subsequent dispositions (e.g., oral
argument). If a decision has been rendered, cite the case as you otherwise
would:

> Complaint at 17, Kelly v. Wyman, 294 F. Supp. 893 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (No.
68 Civ. 394).



============================================================
PAGE 135
============================================================

Cases R10

Always include the docket number, whether parenthetically (when there is a
reported citation) or as the citation (when there is no reported citation):

> Brief of Petitioner-Appellant at 48, United States v. Al-Marri, No.
03-3674 (7th Cir. Nov. 12, 2003).

The document number assigned by the court, such as that found on PACER
for federal cases, may also be included, but is not necessary unless it is essential
to finding the document:

> Amended Complaint & Demand for Jury Trial, Viola v. Am. Brands, Inc.,
No. 85-2496-G (D. Mass. Aug. 1, 1985), ECF No. 14.

With court-produced documents, including oral argument transcripts and
transcripts of record, the same general rules apply:

> Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, Ayers v. Belmontes, 127 S. Ct. 469
(2006) (No. 05-493).

> Transcript of Record at 16-17, Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763
(1950) (No. 306).

With amicus briefs, the same general rules apply, with the sole exception that if
there are more than two signatories to the brief, “et al.” may be used:

> Brief for Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. et
al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Respondents, Moseley v. V Secret
Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418 (2003) (No. 01-1015).

Further, though the above information is sufficient, a parallel citation to an
electronic database or a website may be provided, if helpful:

> Brief for Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. et
al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Respondents, Moseley v. V Secret
Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418 (2003) (No. 01-1015), 2002 WL 1987618.

Such parallel citations must include a pinpoint citation to the electronic
database where one is required for the primary document, and vice versa.

With audio recordings of court proceedings, including oral arguments
and oral dissents, the same general rules apply, except that the title may be
a description of the recording. Time markers should be used for designating
pinpoint citations. If the recording is available online, append a URL pursuant
to rule 18.7:

> Oral Argument at 11:38, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) (No. 70-18),
http: //www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1971/1971_70_18/argument.

> Oral Dissent of Justice Ginsburg at 4:25, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007) (No. 05-1074), http://www.oyez.org
/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_1074/opinion. |

For purposes of short forms (rule 10.9), a citation to a court document
including a case citation suffices as a citation to the case itself. Where the case
may be cited in short form per rule 10.9, it may be cited in short form in the
citation to the court document, but the docket number must still be provided:

> 'Brief for the Petitioner, Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510 (2003) (No.
01-1491).



============================================================

============================================================

"pane Cases

> ?Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Demore, 538 U.S. 510 (No. 01-1491).

Further, the court document itself may be cited using a supra form, unlike the
case, which may not. A supra form for the court document, however, does not
count for purposes of the “five footnote rule” (10.9(a)). The document title will
suffice as a reference so long as it does not create confusion. Hereinafter forms

may also be used (rule 4.2(b)), if helpful:

> 3 Brief for the Petitioner, supra note 1, at 12.

10.8.4 Court Administrative Orders
Cite the official reporter, if therein; give the title of the order, if any:
» Order Discharging the Advisory Committee, 352 U.S. 803 (1956).

10.9 Short Forms for Cases

(a) Footnotes. In law review footnotes, a short form for a case may be used if it
clearly identifies a case that (1) is already cited in the same footnote or (2) is cited
(in either full or short form, including “id.”) in one of the preceding five footnotes.
Otherwise, a full citation is required. Thus in the following example, the use of
the short form in footnotes 4 and 7-8 is correct:

» "United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531 (1985).
> 7 Id. at 537-38.

> 3 See United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 557 (1976); Cal.
Bankers Ass’n v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21, 62 (1974); Zimmermann v. Jenkins
(In re GGM, P.C.), 165 F.3d 1026, 1027 (5th Cir. 1999); Cohen v. Drexel
Burnham Lambert Grp., Inc. (/n re Drexel Burnham Lambert Grp., Inc.),
138 B.R. 687, 702 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1992); In re Draughon Training Inst.,
Inc., 119 B.R. 921, 926 (Bankr. W.D. La. 1990).

> 4 See Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 550; In re Draughon Training, 119
B.R. at 930.

> > New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 457 (1981).
> © See id. at 456.
> 7 See Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. at 540; Cohen, 138 B.R. at 707.

> 8 See Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 550; Cal. Bankers, 416 U.S. at 55; In
re GGM, P.C., 165 F.3d at 1030.

(i) Generally. Use of only one party’s name (or a readily identifiable shorter
version of one party’s name) in a short form citation is permissible only if
the reference is unambiguous. When only one party’s name (or a short form
thereof) is used, it should be italicized. Acceptable short forms include:

» Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. at 585.

» Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U.S. at 585.

» Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585. °

> 343 U.S. at 585.

> Id. at 585.



============================================================
PAGE 137
============================================================

Omit the case name as in the last two examples only if the reader will have no
doubt about the case to which the citation refers.

Per rule 10.2.1(k), a case may also be cited in short form by a different name
than that which appears in the reporter, so long as the full citation includes
both versions:

> Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (The Steel Seizure Case), 343
U.S. 579, 585 (1952).
becomes: The Steel Seizure Case, 343 U.S. at 585.
When citing an entire decision, and not a pinpoint therein, in short form, the
citation must include the shorter version of the case name, the volume number,

reporter designation, and first page; but do zof include a jurisdiction/date
parenthetical:

> The Steel Seizure Case, 343 U.S. 579.

When using only one party’s name in a short form citation, avoid using the
name of a geographical or government unit, a government official, or another
common litigant. Thus:

> NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 464 (1958).

becomes: Patterson, 357 U.S. at 464.

Not: NAACP, 357 U.S. at 464.

Not: Alabama, 357 U.S. at 464.

> Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 480 (1997).
becomes: Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. at 480.
Not: Reno, 520 U.S. at 480.
(ii) Commercial electronic databases. For cases that are available on an

electronic database (rule 10.8.1), use a unique database identifier, if one has
been assigned, in constructing a short form:

> Clark v. Homrighous, No. CIV.A.90-1380-T, 1991 WL 55402, at *3 (D.
Kan. Apr. 10, 1991).

becomes: Clark, 1991 WL 55402, at *3.

> Albrecht v. Stanczek, No. 87-C9535, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5088, at *1
(N.D. Ill. Apr. 18, 1991).

becomes: Albrecht, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5088, at *1.

> Lindquist v. Hart, 1 CA-CV 98-0323, at *2 (Ariz. Ct. App. July 15, 1999)
(Loislaw, Ariz. Case Law).

becomes: Lindquist, at *2 (Loislaw, Ariz. Case Law).

(iii) Slip opinions. For decisions available in only separately printed slip
opinions (rule 10.8.1(b)), use the following format:

>» Commonwealth v. Sam, No. 4359, slip op. at 12 (Pa. Ct. Com. Pl. Oct.
20, 2005).

becomes: Sam, slip op. at 12.



============================================================
PAGE 138
============================================================

When citing multiple slip opinions for the same case, either give each
decision a unique identifier in its initial citation or include a jurisdiction or
date parenthetical in each short form. The following short forms are thus both
acceptable:

> Doe v. Clenchy (Clenchy //), No. CV-09-201, slip op. at 4-6 (Me. Super.
Ct. Nov. 20, 2012).
becomes: Clenchy II, slip op. at 4-6.
Or:
> Doe v. Clenchy, No. CV-09-201, slip op. at 4-6 (Me. Super. Ct. Nov. 20,
2012).
becomes: Clenchy, slip op. at 4-6 (Me. Super. Ct. Nov. 20, 2012).
(b) Two exceptions when using “id.” There are two exceptions when using “id.”
as a short form for case citations: (i) citation to the same case, but to a different

opinion therein; and (ii) citation to the same case where the case citation
includes parallel authorities.

(i) “Id.” for different opinions. When an “id.” refers to the same case, and to
the same opinion cited in the preceding citation, no parenthetical is necessary.
But when an “id.” refers to a different opinion, that fact must be indicated
parenthetically, even if the second opinion cited is the majority opinion. Thus,
the following examples are all correct:

>» 'Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (The Steel Seizure Case), 343
U.S. 579 (1952).
> 7 Id. at 584.
> 31d. at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).
> “Id. at 638.
> 5 Id. at 589 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).
> § Id. at 582 (majority opinion).
After an intervening citation to another source, the next time a case is cited, it is

presumed to be citing to the majority opinion unless a parenthetical indicates
otherwise.

(ii) “Id.” for parallel citations. For cases in which a parallel citation is required,
the “id.” form looks slightly different (to avoid confusion). Thus:
> Chalfin v. Specter, 426 Pa. 464, 465, 233 A.2d 562, 563 (1967).
becomes: Id. at 465, 233 A.2d at 563.
Not: /d. at 465.
Not: Id. at 465, 563.
(c) Text. A case that has been cited in full in the same general discussion may be

referred to (in main text or footnote text) by one of the parties’ names without
further citation:

» The issue presented in Bakke has not been fully resolved.

—————

abbreviation of constitutioncited section symbol and no. of section cited

Cite the United States federal and state constitutions by “U.S.” or the
abbreviated name of the state, respectively (as indicated in table’T'10) and the
word “Const.” Abbreviate the subdivisions of constitutions, such as articles and
clauses, according to table’T'16:

> U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2.

> U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 2.

> U.S. CONST. pmbl.

> U.S. CONST. art. Ill, §§ 1-2.

> La. CONST. art. X, pt. IV.
Cite constitutional provisions currently in force without a date. If the cited
provision has been repealed, either indicate parenthetically the fact and year of
repeal or cite the repealing provision in full:

> U.S. ConsT. amend. XVIII (repealed 1933).

> U.S. Const. amend. XVIII, repealed by U.S. CONST. amend. XXI.

When citing a provision that has been subsequently amended, either indicate
parenthetically the fact and year of amendment or cite the amending provision
in full:

>» U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 1 (amended 1913).

>» U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 1, amended by U.S. CoNsT. amend. XVII.

Cite constitutions that have been totally superseded or are otherwise no longer
in effect by year of adoption; if the specific provision cited was adopted in a
different year, give that year parenthetically:

> ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION of 1781, art. IX, para. 1.
> Ark. Const. of 1868, art. Ill, § 2 (1873).

When citing a constitution contained in an electronic database, indicate
parenthetically the name of the publisher, editor, or compiler unless the
constitution is published, edited, compiled by, or under the supervision of
federal or state officials. Also indicate the name of the database and information
regarding the currentness of the database as provided by the database itself:

> Wash. Const. art. I, § 2 (West, Westlaw through Nov. 2014
amendments).

When referring to multiple amendments, sections within the same article, or
clauses within the same section, it is permissible to use a single citation clause.

Basic Citation Forms

Official and unofficial codes arrange statutes currently in force by subject matter.
Official and privately published session laws report statutes in chronological
order of enactment. Citing official codes is preferable, but not required. Cite
secondary sources—such as looseleaf services, the CIS microform service,
periodicals, newspapers, or electronic databases—only when the above listed
sources are not available.

Rule 12.2 explains when to use each of these basic citation forms. The next four
rules discuss the citation forms for official and unofficial codes (rule 12.3), session
laws (rule 12.4), electronic media and online sources (rule 12.5), and other
secondary sources (rule 12.6). Rule 12.7 explains when the prior or subsequent
history of a statute may or must be cited, and rule 12.8 discusses the use of
explanatory parenthetical phrases with respect to statute citations. Rule 12.9
outlines special citation forms for the Internal Revenue Code, ordinances,

rules of evidence and procedure, model codes, principles, restatements of the

Choosing the Proper Citation Form 12.2

General Rule 12.2.1

(a) Statutes currently in force. If available, cite statutes currently in force to
the current official code or its supplement. Otherwise, cite a current unofficial
code or its supplement, the official session laws, privately published session laws
(e.g., United States Code Congressional and Administrative News), a commercial
electronic database, a looseleaf service, an internet source, or a newspaper—in
that order of preference:

> National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 § 102, 42 U.S.C. § 4332.

For example, a new main edition of the official United States Code is published
every six years, and an annual cumulative supplement is published for each
intervening year. An exact copy of the United States Code in PDF format can
be found at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/uscode/; these versions
may be cited as if they were the print code. Codified federal statutes enacted
subsequent to the latest edition or supplement of the Code should be cited to
an unofficial code (e.g., West’s United States Code Annotated) until published in
the United States Code.



============================================================
PAGE 142
============================================================

12.2.2

Statutes

(b) Statutes no longer in force. Cite statutes no longer in force to the current
official or unofficial code if they still appear therein. Otherwise, cite the last
edition of the official or unofficial code in which the statute appeared, the
session laws, or a secondary source—in that order of preference. In any case,
the fact of invalidation, repeal, or amendment must be noted parenthetically
according to rules 12.7.1, 12.7.2, and 12.7.3:

> Law of June 1, 1895, ch. 4322, § 23, 1895 Fla. Laws 3, 20-21 (repealed
1969).

> Clayton Act, ch. 323, § 7, 38 Stat. 730, 731-32 (1914) (current version at
15 U.S.C. § 18).

(c) Private laws. Cite private laws to the session laws if therein; otherwise, cite
a secondary source:

> Priv. L. No. 94-75, 90 Stat. 2985 (1976).

Exceptions

(a) Scattered statutes. Cite the session laws if a statute appears in so many
scattered sections or titles that no useful citation to the code is possible.
Indicate parenthetically the general location of the codified sections. Thus:

» Tax Reduction Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-12, 89 Stat. 26 (codified as
amended in scattered sections of 26 U.S.C.).

But: Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13-13b, 21a.

If the current version of a statute is split between the main body and the
supplement of a code, it should be cited according to rule 3.1(c):

P 42U.S.C. § 1397b (1982 & Supp. | 1983).

If the current version of a statute can be determined only by reference
to multiple sources (not just a code and its supplement), it should be cited
according to rule 12.7.3:

> 31U.S.C. § 3724 (1988), amended by Act of Dec. 7, 1989, 31U.S.C.S. §
3724 (Law. Co-op. Supp. 1990).

(b) Historical fact. The historical fact of enactment, amendment, or repeal
should be cited to the session laws. A parenthetical reference to the current
version (see rules 12.7.3 and 12.8) may be added:

» Two years later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Pub.
L. No. 89-110, 79 Stat. 437 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971,
1973 to 1973bb-1.

» The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 increased criminal penalties for
mail and wire fraud. See Pub. L. No. 107-204, § 903(a)—(b), 2002
U.S.C.C.A.N. (116 Stat.) 745, 805 (to be codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341,
1343).

(c) Materially different language. If the language in the current code
(including its supplement) differs materially from the language in the session
laws and the relevant title has not been enacted into positive law, cite the session
laws. A parenthetical reference to the code version, introduced by the phrase
“codified with some differences in language at” may be given. If differences in


============================================================
PAGE 143
============================================================

the language merely reflect subsequent amendments, however, cite the current
code.

Cite the official code if available. A current list of federal code titles that have
been enacted into positive law appears in the preface to the latest edition or

supplement of the United States Code. Similarly, state codes should indicate
whether the titles contained therein have been enacted into positive law.

Current Official and Unofficial Codes 12.3

Cite the United States Code (U.S.C.), the official federal code, if available.
Unofficial federal codes include the United States Code Annotated (U.S.C.A.)
and the United States Code Service (U.S.C.S.). Official and unofficial codes for
each state (where they exist) are listed in table T1.3.

As with federal statutes, citing the official state codes is preferred, but not
required.

All citations to codes should contain the abbreviated name of the code found
in table T1 printed in large and small capitals; the section, paragraph, or article
number(s) of the statute; and the year of the code (determined according to
rule 12.3.2):

> N.C. GEN. STAT. § 1-181 (2003).

Additional Information 12.3.1
Additional information may be required as follows:

(a) Name and original section number. Give the statute’s name and original
section number (as it appears in the appropriate session laws) only if the
statute is commonly cited that way or if the information would otherwise aid
in identification. Omit “The” as the first word of a statute’s name. Include the
year of the statute if it is in the official title. An official name, a popular name,
or both may be used:

> Labor Management Relations (Taft-Hartley) Act § 301(a), 29 U.S.C.
§ 185(a).

» Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, 29 U.S.C. § 2601.
(b) Title, chapter, or volume. If a code is divided into separately sectioned or
paragraphed titles, chapters, or volumes, the title, chapter, or volume number
must be indicated. When citing the federal code, give the title number before
the name of the code:

» 42U.S.C. § 1983.

>» 12U.S.C.S. § 1710 (LexisNexis 1993 & Supp. 2004).
The form for citation to state codes varies; table’I'1.3 indicates whether and in
what manner to identify the title, chapter, or volume number of a state code.
For example:

> DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 13, § 1301 (1999).

> NEV. REV. STAT. § 28.501 (1998).

Boa Statutes

If each title, chapter, or volume of a code contains differently numbered
sections or paragraphs, then the volume, chapter, or title number need not be
given separately:

> GA. CODE ANN. § 21-2-16 (2003).

(c) Subject-matter codes. If a separately sectioned or paragraphed portion of
a code is identified by subject matter rather than by a title, volume, or chapter
number, give that subject-matter name as part of the code:

> CAL. VEH. CODE § 11506 (West 2000).

> Tex. FAM. CODE ANN. § 5.01 (Vernon 2002 & Supp. 2004-2005).

‘Table T'1.3 indicates which state codes require this treatment.

(d) Publisher, editor, or compiler. Unless a code is published, edited, compiled
by, or under the supervision of federal or state officials, give the name of the
publisher, editor, or compiler in the parenthetical phrase containing the year
of the code:

» 12 U.S.C. § 1455 (1982 & Supp. | 1983).

(£) Compilations of uncodified laws. If a code contains uncodified laws
printed in a separate compilation, cite in this manner:

> N.Y. UNCONSOL. Law § 751 (McKinney 2000).

(g) Appendices. Ifa statute appears in an appendix to a code, and the statute is
numbered and otherwise printed as if it were part of that code, cite according
to rule 3.4:

> 50 U.S.C. app. § 5.

If the statute is not printed as if it were part of a code, cite the session laws and
add an explanatory phrase (see rule 1.6(a)(ii)) indicating that the statute is
reprinted in the code’s appendix:

» Act of Aug. 31, 1970, ch. 842, 1970 Mass. Acts 732, reprinted in Mass.
GEN. Laws ANN. ch. 40 app. at 180 (West 1985).

(h) Notes. Ifa statute appears in the notes section ofa U.S. Code provision, cite
according to rule 3.4. Information helpful in identifying a specific note should
be added parenthetically:

Statutes f

Year of Code

Citations to the federal code, whether official or unofficial, do not require a date.
When citing a state code, or (if'a date is desired), a federal code, when citing a
bound volume of the current official or unofficial code, provide parenthetically
the year that appears on the spine of the volume, the year that appears on the
title page, or the latest copyright year—in that order of preference. If the date
on the spine or title page spans more than one year, give all years covered. If the
volume is a replacement of an earlier edition, use the year of the replacement
volume, not the year of the original:

> Nes. REV. STAT. § 33-114 (1998).

When citing a provision that appears in a supplement or pocket part, give the
year that appears on the title page of the supplement or pocket part. If there is
none, give the latest copyright year of the supplement or pocket part. In either
case, if the date spans more than one year, give all years included:

> IND. CODE ANN. § 29-1-5-3.1 (West Supp. 2003).

To cite material that appears in both the main volume and a supplement or
pocket part, give both years according to rule 3.1(c):

> Vt. STAT. ANN. tit. 12, § 892 (2002 & Supp. 2004).

Ifa code is published in looseleaf form, give the year that appears on the page
on which the provision is printed or the year that appears on the first page of
the subdivision in which the provision appears—in that order of preference—
rather than the years indicated above:

> ALASKA STAT. § 28.01.010 (2002).

Other dates (such as the date on which an act becomes effective) may also be
given parenthetically according to rule 12.8:

> OKLA. STAT. tit. 10, § 7303-1.7 (1998 & Supp. 2005) (effective July 1,
2002).

Session Laws

(a) Name. When citing session laws, always give the name of the statute and
the public law or chapter number. Omit “The” as the first word of a statute’s
name. An official name, a popular name, or both may be used:

> White-Slave Traffic (Mann) Act, ch. 395, 36 Stat. 825 (1910) (codified as
amended at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421-2424).

» Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, Pub. L. No. 87-195, 75 Stat. 424.

If the statute has no official or popular name, identify the act with a full date.
Use the form “Act of «date of enactment,” or, if that information is unavailable,
“Act effective <date of effectiveness>.” Other identifying information may be
added parenthetically:

laws, followed by the abbreviated name of the session laws in ordinary roman
type. The official federal session laws, Statutes at Large, are abbreviated “Stat.”
Abbreviations for official and privately published state session laws appear in
tables T1.3 and T1.4. When citing state session laws, begin the abbreviated
title of the session laws with the name of the state abbreviated according to
table T10, even if the state name is not part of the official title; omit words in
the official title not necessary for identification:

> 1978 Ark. Acts.

344 (West).

(d) Session laws amending prior acts. Session laws amending prior acts are
often divided into sections within sections; that is, the session law is divided
into primary sections, and these sections, in turn, contain sections of the
amended act. Cite the bill’s sections by abbreviation (sec.) and the amended
act’s sections by symbol (§):

» Labor-Management Relations Act, ch. 120, sec. 101, § 8(a)(3), 61 Stat.
136, 140-41 (1947).

(e) Year or date. Give parenthetically the year in which the statute was passed

amended at 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011-1015).

Omit the year of the statute’s passage if the same year is part of the name of the
statute or of the session laws:

Legislative Materials

LEGISLATIVE MATERIALS

Besides statutes (rule 12), the legislative process generates bills and resolutions
(rule 13.2); committee hearings (rule 13.3); reports, documents, and committee
prints (rule 13.4); floor debates (rule 13.5); and, sometimes, separately bound
legislative histories (rule 13.6). When citing any United States legislative
material except debates, include the title (if relevant), the abbreviated name of
the house, the number of the Congress, the number assigned to the material,
and the year of publication. State legislative materials are cited similarly
except when indicated otherwise. Abbreviations for commonly used words in
legislative materials are listed in table T9.

In addition, include parenthetically the session number for House and Senate
documents published before the 60th Congress (1907), House Reports
published before the 47th Congress (1881), and Senate Reports published
before the 40th Congress (1867). For House and Senate materials published
after these dates, the session number can be inferred from the year of
publication: First sessions always fall in odd-numbered years, while second
sessions always fall in even-numbered years. On rare occasions, Congress holds
a third session. When citing materials produced during a third session, provide
this information parenthetically.

HISTORY OF THE LABOR-MANAGEMENT REPORTING AND
DiscLosure ACT OF 1959, at 397, 400 (1959).

Bills and Resolutions

(a) Unenacted federal bills and resolutions. When citing federal bills, include
the name of the bill (if relevant), the abbreviated name of the house, the
number of the bill, the number of the Congress, the section (if any), and the
year of publication:

» S.516, 105th Cong. § 2 (1997).
> H.R. 422, 106th Cong. (1999).
» Clear Skies Act, S. 485, 108th Cong. (2003).

> Protection from Personal Intrusion Act, H.R. 2448, 105th Cong. § 2(a)
(1997).

A parenthetical indicating the date and stage of the bill may be provided in
order to distinguish among multiple versions of the same bill in the same
Congress. Subcommittee and committee names may be abbreviated according
to tables T6, T9, and T10:

>» S. 593, 101st Cong. § 2 (as passed by Senate, May 31, 1989).

> S.593, 101st Cong. § 2 (as reported by S. Comm. on the Judiciary, May

Cite resolutions analogously, using the following abbreviations:

House Resolution >» H.R. Res.
Senate Resolution » S. Res.
House Concurrent Resolution > H.R. Con. Res.
Senate Concurrent Resolution >» S. Con. Res.
House Joint Resolution >» H.R.J. Res.
Senate Joint Resolution > S.J. Res.
Senate Executive Resolution > S. Exec. Res.
Thus:

> H.R.J. Res. 124, 105th Cong. (1998).

A parallel citation to a published committee hearing, a legislative report, or
the Congressional Record may also be provided if it would assist the reader in
locating the bill (rules 13.3, 13.4, and 13.5).

(b) Enacted federal bills and resolutions. Enacted bills and joint resolutions
are statutes (rule 12). They are cited as statutes except when used to document
legislative history, in which case they are cited as unenacted bills.


============================================================
PAGE 157
============================================================

Legislative Materials R13

Enacted simple resolutions, which bind only one house of Congress, and
enacted concurrent resolutions, which bind either one or both houses of
Congress, should be cited as unenacted bills. Unless otherwise clear in context,
the fact of enactment should be noted parenthetically:

> S. Res. 141, 106th Cong. (1999) (enacted).
> H.R. Con. Res. 196, 106th Cong. (1999) (enacted).
> H.R. Res. 811, 108th Cong. (2004) (enacted).

A parallel citation to the Congressional Record (for simple resolutions) or to the
Statutes at Large (for concurrent resolutions) may be provided if it would assist
the reader in locating the enacted resolution. Because only enacted resolutions
are printed in the Statutes at Large (“Stat.”),a parenthetical noting enactment is
not necessary when a parallel citation to Stat. is given:

> S. Res. 218, 83d Cong., 100 CONG. REC. 2972 (1954) (enacted).
> S. Con. Res. 97, 94th Cong., 90 Stat. 3024 (1976).

(c) State bills and resolutions. When citing state bills and resolutions, include
the name of the legislative body, abbreviated according to tables T6, T9, and
T10, the number of the bill or resolution, the number of the legislative body (or,
if not numbered, the year of the body), and the number or designation of the
legislative session. Parenthetically indicate the name of the state, abbreviated
according to table T10, and the year of enactment (for an enacted bill or
resolution) or the year of publication (for an unenacted bill or resolution).

> H.D. 636, 1999 Leg., 413th Sess. (Md. 1999).
> H.R. 189, 145th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ga. 1999).

A parallel citation to state session laws may be provided if it would assist the
reader in locating an enacted resolution.

> H.R.J. Res. 1, 40th Leg., 2d Spec. Sess., 1974 Utah Laws 7.

Hearings 13.3

(a) Federal committee hearings. When citing federal committee hearings,
always include the entire subject matter title as it appears on the cover, the bill
number (if any), the subcommittee name (if any), the committee name, the
number of the Congress, the page number of the particular material being cited
(if any), and the year of publication. Subcommittee and committee names may
be abbreviated according to tables 'T'6,T9, and T'10. Cite as follows:

> Protection from Personal Intrusion Act and Privacy Protection Act of
1998: Hearing on H.R. 2448 and H.R. 3224 Before the H. Comm. on

13.5 Debates

Cite congressional debates after 1873 to the Congressional Record; use the
daily edition only for matters not yet appearing in the permanent edition. The
primary ways in which the Congressional Record differs from the daily edition
are continuous pagination, altered text, and the dropping of the prefixes H, S,
and E before page numbers:

>» 123 CONG. REC. 17,147 (1977).

» 131 CONG. REC. S11,465-66 (daily ed. Sept. 13, 1985) (statement of
Sen. Malcolm Wallop).

Cite congressional debates through 1873 according to the following models:

1837-1873 >» CONG. GLOBE, 36th Cong., 1st Sess. 1672 (1860).
1824-1837 » 10 ReG. DEB. 3472 (1834).
1789-1824 > 38 ANNALS OF CONG. 624 (1822).

If the debate occurred in a different year from its publication in the
Congressional Record, cite the year in which the debate was published.

For volume one of the Annals give the name(s) of the editor(s) and year of
publication in parentheses:

>» 1ANNALS OF CONG. 486 (1789) (Joseph Gales ed., 1834).

13.6 Separately Bound Legislative Histories

‘The legislative histories of several important acts are published separately (e.g.,
the Administrative Procedure Act, Titles VII and IX of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Act, the Internal Revenue Acts, the National Labor Relations Act,
the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934). If it would aid the reader in locating the source, a parallel citation
may be given to such a separate publication. Cite these publications according
to rule 15 (books, reports, and other nonperiodic materials):

> H.R. REP. No. 80-245, at 6 (1947), reprinted in 1 NLRB, LEGISLATIVE

PAGE 165
============================================================

(a) Administrative adjudications. Cite by the reported name of the first-listed
private party (abbreviated according to rule 10.2) or by the official subject-

Subject-matter titles may sometimes indicate the nature and stage of an
adjudicatory proceeding. It is permissible to shorten such titles, and, if
the nature and stage of the proceeding are not clear from the context, such
information may be included ina parenthetical phrase at the end of the citation.
The parenthetical phrase may consist of terms such as “notice,” “initiation,”
“prelim. neg.,” or “determination,” or may be more elaborate.

official reporter, cite the official release or slip opinion. Provide the full date,
any helpful publication number, and the number of the case or investigation:

volume number and the initial page number, if available; if the initial page
number is not available, retain the case number:

> Rosenberg Library Ass’n, 269 N.L.R.B. No. 197 (Apr. 24, 1984).

Whenever possible, append a parallel citation to an unofficial reporter, service,

€.g., WITH” or “AS TOLD TO,” use this phrase to separate the authors’ names:

> EARVIN “MAGIC” JOHNSON WITH WILLIAM Novak, My LIFE 39 (1993).

(b) More than two authors. Use the first author's name followed by “eT aL.”
when saving space is desired and in short form citations. List all of the authors’

Electronic Databases and Online Sources

(a) Commercial electronic databases. When citing secondary materials to a
database, provide a complete citation to the document according to rule 15
as well as a citation to the database. If the database assigns a unique identifier
or code to the document, include that identifier or code to assist the reader in
locating the document cited.


============================================================
PAGE 175
============================================================

Books, Reports, and Other Nonperiodic Materials

When a source is available both in print and in a commercial electronic
database, a citation to the database may be supplied:

> ABBEY G. HAIRSTON, LEAVE AND DISABILITY COORDINATION HANDBOOK
{110 (2009), Westlaw LDCHBK.

> 25 AM. Jur. 2D Elections § 100, Westlaw (database updated May 2014).

(b) Internet and online sources. Because books found online may differ
in format from the print version, the two sources should not be treated
interchangeably unless the online source is an exact copy of the original as
dictated by rule 18.2.1(a). If a book or report is only available online, cite to it
directly in accordance with rule 18.2.2:

> U.S. DeEP’T OF JUST., LEGAL AUTHORITIES SUPPORTING THE ACTIVITIES
OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY DESCRIBED BY THE PRESIDENT
25 (2006), http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB178/surv39
.pdf [hereinafter NSA WHITE PAPER].

> Lampoon, Dictionary.com, http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/
lampoon (last visited Mar. 19, 2020).

(c) Ebooks. Print versions of books are authoritative; ebooks should be cited
only if they are the sole media through which the book is available. Because
books published as ebooks may differ in format from the print version, the
two sources should not be treated interchangeably. To indicate that an ebook is
being cited, place an “ebook” parenthetical after the date: -

> ANNE UMLAND & BLAIR HARTZELL, PICASSO: THE MAKING OF CUBISM
1912-1914, at 25 (2014) (ebook).

If an ebook uses location numbers rather than page numbers, use “loc.” to
indicate where the cited material can be found:

> RONALD COLLINS & DAVID SKOVER, WHEN MONEY SPEAKS loc. 2992
(2014) (ebook) (“[T]he Buckley wall between contributions and expen-
ditures ... has been breached.”).

Short Citation Forms

Once a book, report, or other nonperiodic material has been cited in full in
a law review footnote, a short form employing either “id.” or “supra” may be
used to refer to the work in subsequent citations. Never use “infra” to refer to
these materials. In general, follow rule 4 for short citation forms; however, use
rule 15.10.1 when referring to a shorter work in collection or the collection as
a whole.

Short Forms for Works in Collection

To cite an essay, article, or document found within a volume of collected shorter
works when the shorter work has already been cited in full, you may use “id.” to
refer to the shorter work if it was cited as the immediately preceding authority
within the same footnote or as the sole authority within the immediately
preceding footnote. Do not use “id.” to refer to the collection as a whole when
citing another shorter work within the collection.

============================================================

Books, Reports, and Other Nonperiodic Materials

Use a “supra” form to refer to the collection as a whole. The “supra” form for the
entire volume should include the title of the collection (rather than an author)
regardless of whether the collected pieces have a single author or multiple
authors.

Use a “supra” form to refer to the shorter work if it was not cited as the
immediately preceding authority in the same footnote or as the sole authority
in the immediately preceding footnote. The “supra” form for the individual
work should include the last name of the author or authors, or, if none, the title
of the shorter work:

Student-Written Law Review Materials

(a) Signed, student-written materials. Signed and titled notes, comments,
projects, etc. are cited in the same manner as any other signed article in a law
review (rule 16.4), with the author’s full name in ordinary roman type at the

A student work is considered signed if a student is credited with writing
or contributing to the piece anywhere within the issue in which the work
appears—on the first page of the piece, at the end of the piece, or in the table of

Electronic Databases and Online Sources

(a) Commercial electronic databases. When citing periodical materials to a
database, provide a complete citation to the document according to rule 16 and
a citation to the database. If the database assigns a unique identifier or code to
each document within the database, include that identifier or code to assist the
reader in locating the document cited.

Some sources are available in two forms, electronic and paper. To facilitate
access to the source, it is permissible to include a direct citation to a commercial
electronic database:

» T.R. Fehrenbach, TV’s Alamo Tale Fairly Accurate, SAN ANTONIO
ExpRESS-NEWS, Mar. 17, 1996, at A1, 1996 WL 2824823.

Econ. NEwSwiRE PLUS, Apr. 22, 1991, at 1, DIALOG, File No. 612.

(b) Internet and online sources. Where a print version is accessible, citation
should be made to the print source. Where, however, the print source is
difficult or impossible to obtain, or the governing authority has designated
the electronic source as the official version, citation should be made to the
electronic source with consideration of rule 18's principles on authentication. If
a periodical source is only available online, cite to it directly in accordance with
rule 18.2.2.

Short Citation Forms

Once a work in a periodical has been cited in full, use “id.” or “supra” to refer to
it in subsequent citations.

(a) Id. If the work cited is the same as the immediately preceding authority
within the same footnote or as the sole authority within the immediately
preceding footnote, use “id.” and indicate any difference in page number:

hereinafter form (rule 4.2(b)), use the hereinafter form in place of the author’s
name, the title, or the designation. Give the footnote in which the full citation
appears unless the full citation is in the same footnote, in which case “supra”
may be used without a footnote reference. In using a “supra” form, always
indicate the page or pages cited except when citing the work in its entirety:

R18 ‘The Internet, Electronic Media, and Other Nonprint Resources

18.2 The Internet

The Bluebook requires the use and citation of traditional printed sources
when available, unless there is a digital copy of the source available that is
authenticated, official, or an exact copy of the printed source, as described in
rule 18.2.1.

‘The rules that follow offer guidance in formatting internet citations. Rule 18.2.1
lays out general principles applicable to all internet citations. Rule 18.2.2 sets
out rules for direct citations to internet sources. E-mails should be treated as
unpublished letters per rule 17.2.4.

18.2.1 General Internet Citation Principles

(a) Sources that can be cited as if to the original print source. When an
authenticated, official, or exact copy of a source is available online, citation
can be made as if to the original print source (without any URL information
appended). Many states have begun to discontinue printed official legal
resources, instead relying on online versions as the official resources for
administrative or legislative documents. The federal government is also moving
toward increasing access to online versions of legal documents, though it
continues to publish official print versions.

(i) Authenticated documents. When citing to such materials, The Bluebook
encourages citation to “authenticated” sources: those that use an encryption-
based authentication method, such as a digital signature or public key
infrastructure, to ensure the accuracy of the online source. Generally, an
authenticated document will have a certificate or logo indicating that a
government entity verified that the document is complete and unaltered.

(ii) Official versions. Some states have designated, either by legislation or
other official mechanism, that the online source is the “official” source for a
particular legal document. Some online publishers similarly make a distinction
as to whether the document has been approved by, contributed by, or harvested
from an official source by the content originator, designating such a document
“official.” Generally, The Bluebook prefers citation to an authenticated source, or,
if none is available, to the “official” source.

(iii) Exact copies. An exact copy is one that is an unaltered copy of the printed
source in a widely used format that preserves pagination and other attributes of
the printed work (such as a PDF).

(b) Sources where the URL should be appended.

(i) Obscure sources. If the cited information is available in a traditional source
but such source is so obscure as to be practically unavailable, or if a parallel
citation to an internet source will substantially improve access to the source
cited, citation should be made both to the traditional source and to the internet
source by appending the URL directly to the end of the citation.

(ii) Online sources with print characteristics. If an online source shares the
characteristics of a print source such that it could be fully cited according to
another rule in The Bluebook, the citation should be made as if to the print
source and the URL appended directly to the end of the citation, even if it is

176
unknown whether the cited information is available in print.

-strategic-voting-econ-working-paper_085307749177.pdf.

To share the characteristics of a print source, an online source must be a version
permanently divided into pages with permanent page numbers, as in a PDF,
and have the elements that characterize a given print source, such as a volume
number (for law review articles and the like) or publication date (for magazine
articles and the like).

If an online source can be formatted in full compliance with another rule in The
Bluebook, for purposes of citation style it does not matter whether that source
has in fact been published in print. As noted above, traditional printed sources
or authenticated digital copies are required as a matter of authority; this does
not, however, affect the citation rules for print-like online sources.

(c) Order of parentheticals. When such a citation requires multiple
parentheticals, place them in the order indicated in rule 1.5(b). Thus, the
URL of a source cited in accordance with rule 18.2.1(b) should follow format-
related parenthetical information (such as “on file with author,” “unpublished
manuscript,” or “emphasis added”) and related authority parentheticals (such
as “citing” or “quoting”), but precede explanatory parentheticals:

> Polly J. Price, Precedent and Judicial Power After the Founding,

http: //lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2166
&context=bclr (discussing precedent in the context of statutory
construction).

(d) Archival. Archiving of internet sources is encouraged, but only when a
reliable archival tool is available. For citations to internet sources, append the
archive URL to the full citation in brackets:

Citations to Internet Sources

An internet source that cannot be cited according to another rule in The
Bluebook as stated in accordance with rule 18.2.1(b)(ii), should be cited as if
to the original print source in accordance with rule 18.2.1(a) or according

18.2.2



============================================================

============================================================

The Internet, Electronic Media, and Other Nonprint Resources

to this rule. All efforts should be made to cite to the most stable electronic

location available. The internet citation should include information designed
to facilitate the clearest path of access to the cited reference, including the title,
pagination, and publication date as they appear on the webpage. The internet
URL should be separated by a comma and appended to the end of the citation.

(a) Author. When available, provide author information in ordinary roman
type. When no author is clearly announced, omit author information from the
citation unless there is a clear institutional owner of the domain. Abbreviate the
name of an institutional author according to rule 15.1(d):

(i) Main page titles. The citation should always include the homepage or domain
name of which the particular citation is a part, referred to here as a “main page
title.” The website’s main page title should be cited using large and small caps.
Capitalization should conform to the title as it appears on the site. Main page
titles should be abbreviated in accordance with tables T6,T10, andT13:

(ii) Titles for pages other than the main page. The title of the specific pages
within the domain name and linked from the main page, for example postings
or comments to postings, should also be included where relevant. Titles to
subheadings should appear in italics. Follow standard rules for capitalizing the
titles of sources in accordance with rule 8, even if the title bar uses nonstandard
capitalization. Where appropriate, subheadings should include language
indicating the page’s relation to the page to which it responds:

(iii) Titles for blogs contained within a larger website. If the cited source
is published under the name of a blog that has its own content and presence
within a larger website, both the name of the site and the name of the blog

should be included:

> Eugene Volokh, LINKEDIN, http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eugene
-volokh-b075bb9a (last visited Mar. 27, 2014).

(c) Date and time. The date should be provided as it appears on the internet
site. Use only dates that refer clearly to the material cited. The date should be
indicated after the main page title and any pinpoint citation:

» Ashby Jones, Activists, Research Facilities Taking Disclosure Battles to
the Courts, WALL ST. J.: L. BLoG (Feb. 26, 2009, 9:40 AM), http://blogs
.wsj.com/law/2009/02/26/activists-research-facilities-taking
-disclosure-battles-to-the-courts.

If there is no date associated with the specific subject matter of the citation,
“last updated” or “last modified” dates should be supplied in a parenthetical
after the URL. If the online resource has been updated or corrected on a date
different from the online publication date, use that date in lieu of the original
online publication date:

> Rowaida Abdelaziz, Advocacy Groups Renew Calls for Bloomberg
to Renounce NYPD’s Muslim Surveillance, HUFFPOST, https: //www
-huffpost.com/entry/muslim-surveillance-michael-bloomberg-nypd
_n_5e5424d5c5b66729cf6067d4 (Feb. 24, 2020, 4:30 PM).

When material is otherwise undated, the date that the website was last visited
should be placed in a parenthetical after the URL:

> YaHoo!, http://www.yahoo.com (last visited Dec. 15, 2004).

If an archival tool that indicates when a source was archived is utilized, it is not
necessary to include a “last visited” parenthetical after the URL.

It is recommended that citations for internet sources include a timestamp
whenever possible. Especially when the citation is for a comment to a posting
or is otherwise easily identifiable by the time of its posting, the timestamp listed
on the subheading should be included with the date:

‘The Internet, Electronic Media, and Other Nonprint Resources

(d) The URL. A site’s internet address, or URL, should point readers directly
to the source cited rather than to an intervening page of links. If there is a
shortlink available that clearly indicates the source site (e.g., wapo.st, imdb.to,
but not bit.ly), then cite the shortlink. If no shortlink is available, but the full
URL is straightforward, then cite the entire URL as it appears in the address
bar of the browser:

> Stanley Kubrick Biography, \MDB, http://www.imdb.com/name
/nm0000040/bio?ref_=nm_ql_1 (last visited Feb. 28, 2015).

Not: Stanley Kubrick Biography, |MDs, http://imdb.com (search in search
bar for “Stanley Kubrick”; then follow “Biography” hyperlink under
“Quick Links”) (last visited Feb. 28, 2015).

Alternatively, the root URL of the site from which information is accessed may
be used if (1) the URL is long, unwieldy, or full of nontextual characters (such
as question marks, percentage signs, or ampersands); or (2) the source may be
obtained only by submitting a form or query. If the root URL is used and the
site’s format is not clear from the rest of the citation, a clarifying parenthetical
should be added to explain how to access the specific information to which the

citation refers:

> http://fisrc.urban.org/noframe/wqs/q_data_1.htm#2001 (choose
“2001” from dropdown; then choose “Defendants in Criminal Cases-
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC)”; then click “out” and
“submit”; then follow “TTSECMO” hyperlink).

Not: http://fjsrc.urban.org/noframe/wqs/q_e.cfm?cat=3&year=2001
&agency=AOUSC&saf=out&varl=TTSECMSO.

Note that some URLs are case sensitive, so cite URLs as they appear in the
internet browser.

(e) Multiple URLs. Some popular sites are served by more than one URL. In
these cases, a proper citation should use the primary URL rather than a URL
that links to an alternate server:

> Macy’s, http://www.macys.com (last visited Feb. 28, 2015).
Not: Macy’s, http://www1.macys.com (last visited Feb. 28, 2015).

(f) Document format. If a document is available both in HTML format
and in a widely used format that preserves pagination and other attributes of
printed work (such as PDF), the latter should always be cited in lieu of an
HTML document:

> Elizabeth C. McNichol & Iris J. Lav, State Budgets: On the Edge?, Ctr.
ON BuDGET & Pow’y Priorities 1 (Nov. 8, 2006), https://www.cbpp

/research/state-budgets-on-the-edge.

(g) Pinpoint citations. If the cited document is rendered in a format that
preserves the pagination of a print version (such as a PDF file), pinpoint
citations should be provided where appropriate. Page numbers should always
refer to the numbers that appear on the document itself. Do not use “screen

numbers’ or other numbers that may appear in a software viewing window or
scroll bar. When there is pagination information available, it should be included
between the domain name and the date or URL, whichever comes first.

Commercial Electronic Databases

Because of the reliability and authoritativeness of LEXIS, Westlaw, Bloomberg
Law, and other commercial electronic databases such as Dialog, cite such sources,
if available, in preference to the other sources covered by rule 18. Citations to these
electronic databases should be consistent with this present rule regardless of whether
the databases are accessed through proprietary software or through a website such
as http://www.westlaw.com or http://www.lexisnexis.com. For guidance as to the
specific use of commercial electronic databases, see the following rules:

CD-ROM and Other Electronic Storage Media

(a) Print form preferred. Information found on CD-ROM or another
medium of electronic distribution (flash drive, etc.) is usually available in print
form, and citation to the print form is preferred. If the information is accessed
by electronic storage medium, however, it should be cited to that medium.

(b) Citation format. When citing CD-ROM or other similar media, include
the title of the material, the publisher of the CD-ROM, the version searched,
and the date of the material, if available, or the date of the version searched.
The information may be provided in a source-date parenthetical or, if the
information is voluminous, as related authority (rule 1.6):

> 7 LAWRENCE P. KING, COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY ] 700.02 (Matthew
Bender Authority Bankruptcy Law CD-ROM, rel. 13, Aug. 1999).

Microform

Microform Collections Reproducing Preexisting Materials

In general, when a document is reproduced in microform, it is not necessary to
indicate this fact unless it would otherwise be difficult for a reader to identify
and obtain the source. When citing material as “microformed on” a service,
provide a complete citation to the original document and a citation to the
microform in accordance with rule 1.6 regarding citations to related authority.
If the microform service assigns a unique identifier or code to each document
reproduced, include that identifier to assist the reader in locating the document
cited. Include the name of the publisher of the microform series in parentheses,
abbreviated according to rule 15.1(d):

Microform Collections Containing Original Materials

When a microform collection contains materials original to that collection,
identify the microform set and its publisher, and use the publisher’s system for
identifying individual forms within the set. Use rule 18.5.1 as a guide.

Films, Broadcasts, and Noncommercial Video Materials

Cite films in large and small capitals, and television or radio broadcasts in
italics, by title, episode name (if available), and exact date (if available). Include
the name of the company or network that produced the film or broadcast. If
there is no information as to the producer of the broadcast, include the name of
the company or network that aired the broadcast:

When a television broadcast is also available online, a citation to the online
source is acceptable in accordance with rule 18.2.2.

If the video was originally broadcast online, cite per rule 18.2.2 for dynamic
websites. Consistent with the general principles of that rule, all efforts should
be made to cite to the distinct URL for the specific video. Use the creator of
the video as the author if available; otherwise treat the person who posted the
video as the author. When the site indicates that the video contains contents
from another source, use an explanatory parenthetical to indicate that source:

SERVICES

Cases, administrative materials, and brief commentaries are often published
unofficially in topical compilations called “services,” which appear in looseleaf
form initially and are sometimes published later as bound volumes. Consult
Legal Looseleafs in Print, which is updated annually, for a comprehensive listing
of services. Rule 19.1 provides rules for citing services. Some services are no
longer published in print or are otherwise available online.

Citation Form for Services

Cite services by volume, abbreviated title in ordinary roman type, publisher,
subdivision, and date. If the source is a case, include the abbreviated name of
the court in the same parenthetical as the date, as you would under rule 10.4.
Consult table T15 for service and publisher abbreviations; if a service is not
listed, refer to table T'6 to abbreviate the words that make up its title:

>» In re Smithfield Estates, Inc., [1985-1986 Transfer Binder] Bankr. L.
Rep. (CCH) ] 70,707 (Bankr. D.R.I. Aug. 9, 1985).

> SEC v. Tex. Int’l Airlines, 29 Fed. R. Serv. 2d (West) 408 (D.D.C. 1979).
> Kovacs v. Comm’r, 74 A.F.T.R.2d (RIA) 354 (6th Cir. 1994).

When citing looseleaf material that will eventually be bound, add the name of
the bound form in parentheses if it is different from the name of the looseleaf
form; include the volume of the bound form if available:

> Marietta Concrete Co., 3 Lab. Rel. Rep. (BL) (84 Lab. Arb. Rep. (BL)
1158 (May 7, 1985).

When citing to services found on a commercial electronic database, provide a
parallel citation to the database, including the database identifier and any codes
or numbers that identify the information.

> Dynda Thomas, Conflict Minerals - You Have More to Worry About than
Just the SEC, 38 Chem. Reg. Rep. (BL) 186, 38 CRR 186 (BL) (Feb. 10,
2014).

(a) Volume. The volume designation of a service may be a number, a year, a
descriptive subtitle from the volume’s spine, or a combination of these. If the
volume designation includes words or a year, use brackets to avoid confusion:

> 5 Trade Reg. Rep.


============================================================

> 1979-1 Trade Cas.

> [Current Developments] Hous. & Dev. Rep.
> [1979] 8 Stand. Fed. Tax Rep.

> [2 Wages-Hours] Lab. L. Rep.

> [1 Estate & Gift] U.S. Tax Rep.

In citing a transfer binder, the volume designation should indicate the years of
material included in that binder:

> [1994-1995 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec. L. Rep.
See generally rule 3.1(a) (designation of volumes and use of brackets).

(b) Publisher. Every citation to a service, whether looseleaf or bound, must
indicate the publisher. Enclose an abbreviation of the publisher’s name in
parentheses following the service's title. Consult table’T'15 for a list of service
publisher abbreviations; if a publisher is not listed, abbreviate according to
rule 15.1(d).

> 4 Lab. L. Rep. (CCH) 1.9046.
> [1982] 12 Env’t L. Rep. (Env’t L. Inst.).

(c) Subdivision. Cite services by paragraph or section number if possible,
otherwise by page number. See generally rule 3.2 (pages, footnotes, endnotes,
and graphical materials) and rule 3.3 (sections and paragraphs). Additionally,
a report number may be given if it will assist the reader in locating the cited
material:

> Rhode Island Insurance Agents Agree Not to Rig Bids, [Jan.—June] Anti-
trust & Trade Reg. Rep. (BL) No. 967, at D-11 (June 5, 1980).

> Domination of Markets, AMA Report Finds Consumers Have Few
Options, [Jan.—Feb.] Antitrust & Trade Reg. Rep. (BL) No. 96, at 88
(2008).

(d) Date. When citing a case reported in a service, give the exact date (for
looseleaf services) or year (for bound services) of the case (rule 10.5):

> Defenders of Wildlife, Inc. v. Watt, [1982] 12 Env’t L. Rep. (Env’t L. Inst.)
20,210 (D.D.C. May 28, 19871).

When citing a statute or regulation, give the exact date of its enactment or
promulgation unless the exact date is indicated elsewhere in the citation:

> Act of Sept. 26, 1980, Food Drug Cosm. L. Rep. (CCH) 4] 653.

Citations to other material (such as articles or commentary) should give the
exact date, if available. When citing otherwise undated material in a looseleaf
service, give the date of the page on which the material is printed or the date of
the subsection in which it is printed:

> ERISA Preemption Bills Draw Praise from Labor and Criticism from
Business, [Aug. 1991-June 1993] Pens. Plan Guide (CCH) | 26,263, at

Short Citation Forms

(a) Cases. For cases, use short citation forms as provided by rule 10.9. Include the
complete volume designation for the service binder and substitute paragraph or
section numbers for page numbers where appropriate. Ifa case has page numbers
as well as paragraph or section numbers, you may cite individual pages instead of
the paragraph or section number in the short form to identify specific material.
‘To cite the entire case in short form, give the paragraph or section number of the

(b) Other materials. Short form citations for other materials found in services,
such as statutes, regulations, articles, and commentary, should follow the
relevant citation rules as described elsewhere in The Bluebook.

FOREIGN MATERIALS

Table T2 contains jurisdiction-specific citation examples and is the primary
source for the citation of foreign materials. For sources not present in table’ T’2,
which is now located online, follow the respective country’s own citation rules
for the sources as modified by these general rules.

Jurisdiction

When citing any non-U.S. source, whether in English or in another language,
indicate parenthetically the jurisdiction issuing the source, abbreviated
according to table’I'10, unless the jurisdiction is otherwise clear from the other
elements of the citation:

>» Chase v. Campbell, [1962] S.C.R. 425 (Can.).
» Berry v Dorsey (1975) 101 ALR 35 (Austl.).

Non-English-Language Documents

Documents Appearing in More than One Language

Unless otherwise required by the citation, always cite the most official or
authoritative version of the document. The document itself should clarify
which version(s) is authoritative. For documents published in multiple
languages, use the English-language version whenever it is as authoritative as
(or more authoritative than) other versions. If the document is silent on the
issue of authority, always cite the English-language version unless the purpose
served by the citation requires otherwise.

Titles and Names of Documents in Languages

Other than English

(a) Original language and translation. When citing a document ina language
other than English, always give the document’s full title or name in the original
language the first time the document is cited. If desired, the original-language
title may be followed by brackets containing its shortened or full-length
English title in the same typeface as the original:

> Verdrag tot het Vermijden van Dubbele Belasting [Agreement for the
Avoidance of Double Taxation]

(b) Capitalization. Capitalize names and titles in languages other than
English as they appear on the page. Capitalize translations according to rule 8.

Abbreviations in Languages Other than English

‘The abbreviations of reporters, codes, statutes, statutory collections, constitutions,
and periodicals in languages other than English may be unfamiliar to the reader.
‘Therefore, the full form should be given the first time the source is cited, and
the abbreviation should be given in brackets. Thereafter for the whole piece, the
abbreviated form may be used without cross-reference.

Abbreviations for many legal materials in languages other than English are
given in table T2; for periodicals, see rule 20.6. When abbreviating foreign
legal materials for which an abbreviation is not provided, follow the usage of
the source.

20.2.4 Languages That Do Not Use the Roman Alphabet

Transliterate all titles, names, or words cited that are not in the Roman
alphabet, using a standard transliteration system (for example, the ALA-LC
Romanization Tables).

(a) Languages generally. For instructions regarding transliteration that are
specific to particular countries, check the relevant entries in table T2.

(b) Chinese language.

(i) Chinese language romanization. For citations to Chinese language sources,
regardless of jurisdiction or place of publication, always provide romanization as
instructed here. Whenever possible, also provide Chinese characters for authors,
titles, and case names. Do not use Chinese characters without accompanying
romanization, as some publishers or databases may drop them from citations.
Use simplified or traditional characters to reflect the usage of the source.
Generally, add an English translation or shortened form in English as provided
in rule 20.2.2. Do not cite a Chinese language source in English only.

For romanization of Chinese language citations, use the Pinyin romanization
system as set forth in the international standard, Hanyu Pinyin Fang’an (1958),
and related documents. Do not include tone marks. Do not use “v” to represent
“a.” Competing standards exist for word division in Pinyin. Follow commonly
accepted guidelines for word division in scholarly publications as summarized
in the examples below and in table’ T2. Note that the Pinyin standard used in
many libraries differs with regard to word division and separates most syllables,
so when searching for sources in library catalogs, it may be necessary to break
up compound words into separate syllables.

For capitalization in Pinyin romanization, follow rule 8 and related guidelines.
Do not capitalize the possessive “de” (EJ).

(ii) Chinese personal names. When citing a Chinese author or editor’s name,
regardless of jurisdiction or place of publication, follow rules 15.1 and 16.2,
giving the full name in the order it appears on the document. Repeat the full
name in subsequent short citations to the source. For Chinese personal names
in case citations, follow rule 10.2.1(g).

(A) Chinese language sources. In Chinese language texts the surname is
always given first. Transcribe authors and editors of Chinese texts in Pinyin,

(B) English language sources. Chinese names in English texts may follow
either Chinese (surname first) or English (surname last) word order. They also
may or may not be spelled according to the Pinyin system and may vary in
fullness. Transcribe the full name in the order and in the spelling in which it
appears on the document.

Citations to Translations of Non-English-Language Documents

If desired, a work that conveniently reprints the primary authority in
translation may be cited when referring to a foreign-language source that is not
widely available to researchers in the United States. In such cases, provide the
citation to the original source in accordance with rules 20 and 21, and provide
a parallel citation to the translated version, according to rule 1.6(a), introduced
by “translated in”:

(i) Form of agreement. The title of the treaty should indicate the form of
the agreement (e.g., Agreement, Convention, Memorandun, Protocol, Treaty,
Understanding). Use only the first form designation that appears on the title
page, unless doing so would create ambiguity:

European Union Courts

Cite a case before the Court of Justice of the European Union (formerly
the Court of Justice of the European Communities) or the General Court
(formerly the Court of Fiist Instance) by case number; the names of the parties,
abbreviated according to rule 10.2 and table’I'6; and the official reports of the
Court, including the year of decision (rule 21.5.2(a)). A parallel citation to a
private service may be made, if necessary (rule 21.5.2(b)).

For cases lodged before the Court of Justice since 1989, the case number will
contain the prefix “C”; older cases will not have a prefix. Cases lodged before
the General Court, created in 1989, will carry the prefix “T,” and the Civil
Service Tribunal will carry the prefix “F.” Where the Commission, Council,
or Parliament of the European Union is one of the parties, give its name as
“Commission,” “Council,” or “Parliament,” respectively:

» Case T-198/98, Micro Leader Bus. v. Comm’n, 1999 E.C.R. II-3989.

> Case C-213/89, The Queen v. Sec’y of State for Transp. ex parte Factor-
tame Ltd., 1990 E.C.R. 1-2433.

>» Case 58/69, Elz v. Comm’n, 1970 E.C.R. 507.

Cases on European Union law are often decided in the courts of member
states. These cases should be cited to the reporters of the particular member
state. If necessary, such cases may also be cited to one of the unofficial reporters
collecting materials regarding the European Union (see rule 21.5.8). When
citing such a case to European Union materials, indicate the court and
jurisdiction if not clear from the context, as provided by rule 20.1.

(a) Official reports. For pre-1990 cases, cite the Reports of Cases Before the
Court of Justice of the European Communities (E.C.R.). For cases between 1990
and 2011, cite the Reports of Cases Before the Court of Justice and the Court of First
Instance (also abbreviated E.C.R.). Place the year designation before the reporter
abbreviation. Starting in 1990, page numbers in the E.C.R. begin with a “I,”
“Ul,” or “UP:

» Case C-286/01, Comm’n v. France, 2002 E.C.R. 1-5463.
>» Case 30/79, Land Berlin v. Wigei, 1980 E.C.R. 151.

Comm’n, 1966 E.C.R. 299.

The E.C.R. was discontinued after 2011.

Starting in 2012, use the European Case-Law Identifier (ECLI) to cite to EU
Court cases. All decided EU cases will have a generated ECLI. The format has
four components, in addition to the prefix “ECLI”:

+ “EU” indicates a decision delivered by one of the Courts of the European
Union.

* An abbreviation corresponding to the court or tribunal that delivered the
decision: “C” indicates the Court of Justice, “T” indicates the General Court,
and “F” indicates the Civil Service Tribunal.

° The year of the decision.


============================================================

Commission on Human Rights. These cases should be cited to Collections
of Decisions of the European Commission on Human Rights (Eur. Comm’n H.R.
Dec. & Rep.) or Y.B. Eur. Conv. on H.LR., if therein. If not, cite European Human
Rights Reports (Eur. H.R. Rep.). When citing Y.B. Eur. Conv. on H.R., indicate
parenthetically whether the case was before the Commission or the Court.

United Nations Sources

‘The Official Records are the preferred source for United Nations citations, but
masthead documents and documents drawn from U.N. websites are acceptable.
Press releases, sales documents, yearbooks, and periodicals should be cited only
when preferred sources are unavailable.

Whenever possible, paragraph and article numbers, rather than page numbers
of the Official Records, should be used for pincites. Some documents utilize
both unnumbered and numbered paragraphs, referred to as preambular and
operative paragraphs, respectively; cite language in preambular paragraphs by
page number and language in operative paragraphs by paragraph number. For
General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, cite the Official Records
and provide a parallel citation for the individual resolution.

This section covers the principal organs of the United Nations and several
subsidiaries of the General Assembly. Subsidiaries of organs or committees
should be included in citations whenever appropriate. Other organs and
committees not specifically covered by this section should be cited analogously
to the examples in this rule. If a committee is known by an abbreviation, write



============================================================
PAGE 231
============================================================

International Materials R21

out the committee’s full name and include an abbreviation in brackets if useful
for subsequent citations.

Verbatim and Summary Records 21.7.1

The General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Economic and Social
Council have Official Records. All citations to verbatim and summary records
should be to the Official Records whenever possible.

Include the Official Records title; the subdivision of the organ, if necessary;
the session and meeting number; the pincite, if necessary; the U.N. document
symbol; and the date:

> U.N. GAOR, 56th Sess., 1st plen. mtg. at 3, U.N. Doc. A/56/PV.1 (Sept.
12, 2001).

> U.N. SCOR, 59th Sess., 4893d mtg. at 2, U.N. Doc. S/PV.4893 (Jan. 15,
2004).

Resolutions and Decisions 21.7.2

Authorized versions of resolutions appear in the Official Records. It has
become customary, however, to cite electronic versions or resolutions found in
the Official Document System (ODS) of the United Nations using resolution
symbols. For pincites to material within a resolution, use paragraph or article
numbers.

(a) General Assembly. After 1976, General Assembly resolution symbols are
designated as session number/resolution number. The first resolution adopted
during the forty-seventh General Assembly would thus be G.A. Res. 47/1.

Prior to 1976, the resolution symbols continued increasing from year to year
and the session number was indicated as a Roman numeral in parentheses after
the resolution number.

(i) General Assembly resolutions. General Assembly resolutions are cited by
resolution number and date.

> G.A. Res. 832 (IX), at 19 (Oct. 21, 1954).
> GA. Res. 47/163, 1.5 (Dec. 18, 1992).

(ii) General Assembly decisions. General Assembly decisions are cited by
resolution number and date.

> G.A. Dec. 62/557, U.N. Doc. A/63/49 (Vol. III), at 106 (Sept. 15, 2008).

(iii) General Assembly resolutions known by a popular name. For General
Assembly resolutions known by a specific title (e.g., the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights), or for resolutions whose title is important in the context
cited, insert the title after the resolution number. Note that some documents

Officially published opinions of the Commission of Appeals from 1879 to
1892 were adopted by the Supreme Court and should be cited as opinions
of the Supreme Court. Opinions of the Commission of Appeals from 1918
to 1945 have a notation from the Supreme Court that usually appears in the
final paragraph of the opinion, e.g., “opinion adopted,” “holding approved,” or
“judgment adopted.” Commission opinions that were adopted by the Supreme
Court should be cited as opinions of the Supreme Court. “Holding approved”
and “judgment adopted” opinions are cited by using “holding approved” or
“judgm’t adopted,” e.g., Savage v. Cowen, 33 S.W.2d 433 (Tex. Comm’n App. 1930,
judgm’t adopted).

T6 COMMON WORDS IN CASE NAMES, INSTITUTIONAL
AUTHOR NAMES, AND PERIODICAL TITLES

Abbreviate case names, institutional author names, and periodical titles in
citations by abbreviating any word listed below (rules 10.2.2 and 16). It is
permissible to abbreviate other words of eight letters or more if substantial space
is thereby saved and the result is unambiguous in context. (Thus, it would be
permissible to abbreviate “Encyclopaedia Britannica” to “Encyc. Britannica” or
“Petroleum” to “Petrol.”) Unless otherwise indicated, plurals are formed by adding
the letter “s.” Abbreviate any word in the possessive form by adding an apostrophe
if the word is plural and an apostrophe with the letter “s” if the word is singular
(Thus, abbreviate “Employees” to “Emps.” and “Employee’s” to “Emp.’s”).

For periodical titles only, the rules in this paragraph apply. Abbreviate “University”

as “U.” (“U. Chi. L. Rev.”). Also, omit the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the” (but

retain the word “on”). Furthermore, if the title consists of only one word after
Ge 9 Nes

the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the” have been omitted, do not abbreviate the
remaining word. Rule 6.1(a) explains the spacing of abbreviations.

Institutional Names in Periodical Titles

713 INSTITUTIONAL NAMES IN PERIODICAL TITLES

Always use the title of the periodical that appears on the title page of the issue
you are citing, even if the title of the periodical has changed over time.

Note that preferred abbreviation conventions for individual journals may
differ from those listed in this table. The abbreviation conventions listed here
are primarily intended to serve a national audience and to clearly indicate the
cited source.

To abbreviate English language periodical titles, use tables T13, T'6, and T10.
Common institutional names (e.g., law schools, professional organizations,
and geographic units commonly found in institutional names) are listed in
table T13. If an institutional name is not listed in table T13, individual words
should be abbreviated using tables’I'6 and T'10. If a word in an institutional
name is not listed in these tables, use the full word in the abbreviated periodical
title. Other words in the periodical title should be abbreviated using tables'T6
and 110. If a word is not listed in either table T'6 or T'10, use the full word in
the abbreviated title.

Omit the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the” (but retain the word “on”). Also, if
the title consists of only one word after the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the”
have been omitted, do not abbreviate the remaining word. Rule 6.1(a) explains
the spacing of abbreviations:

» Maggie Blackhawk, Federal Indian Law as Paradigm Within Public Law,
132 HARV. L. REV. 1787 (2019).

Ifa periodical title itself contains an abbreviation, use that abbreviation in the
abbreviated title:
> IMF Surv.

Omit commas from periodical title abbreviations but retain other punctuation:

> Peter H. Huang & Ho-Mou Wu, More Order Without More Law: A Theory
of Social Norms and Organizational Cultures, 10 }.L. ECON. & ORG. 390
(1994).

» Nineteen States Adopt Code of Judicial Conduct, OveEz! Oyez!, Feb. 1974,
at 11.

> Amy Hackney Blackwell & Christopher William Blackwell, Hijacking
Shared Heritage: Cultural Artifacts and Intellectual Property Rights, 13
CHI.-KENT J. INTELL. PRoP. 137 (2013).

For periodical titles containing colons, omit words following the colon from
the abbreviation:

> Darren J. Mills, Personal Goodwill, a Corporate Asset, or No Asset at All,
91 TAXES 47 (2013).

Not: Darren J. Mills, Personal Goodwill, a Corporate Asset, or No Asset at
All, 91 TAXES: THE TAX MAGAZINE 47 (2013).
Ifa periodical has been renumbered in a new series, indicate that fact:

> Jill Martin, The Statutory Sub-Tenancy: A Right Against the World?,
41 CONV. & Prop. LAW. (n.s.) 96 (1977).
