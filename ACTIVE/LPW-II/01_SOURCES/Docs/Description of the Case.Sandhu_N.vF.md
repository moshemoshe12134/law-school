Description of the Case | Client: EchoCraft | Neelam Sandhu

I. Cases/Rules/Statutes Involved

This appeal arises from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York’s

grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant EchoCraft Productions on two claims brought by

Plaintiff Philip Riven: i) retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and ii)

copyright infringement under the Copyright Act.

i) The retaliation claim is governed by Title VII’s anti-retaliation provision, 42 U.S.C. §

2000e-3(a), which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee because the

employee has opposed an unlawful employment practice or participated in an investigation, proceeding,

or hearing under Title VII. The legal framework for analyzing retaliation claims follows the

burden-shifting structure articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). To

establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that he engaged in protected activity, that

the employer was aware of the activity, that the employer took an adverse employment action, and that

there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. Littlejohn v. City of

New York, 795 F.3d 297 (2d Cir. 2015). On summary judgment, the court must view the evidence in the

light most favorable to the non-moving party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477

U.S. 242 (1986).

ii) The copyright claim is governed by the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., specifically by

the fair use provision codified at 17 U.S.C. § 107. That statute sets forth four factors to be considered in

determining whether a use of a copyrighted work constitutes fair use: the purpose and character of the

use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect

of the use on the potential market for the copyrighted work. The Supreme Court’s decision in Campbell v.

Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994), guides the analysis of whether a work is transformative

under the first factor. The parties stipulated that Riven’s copyright in the song “Revere Paul Revere” is

valid and that the work is not a work for hire. The copyright analysis is limited to the four-factor fair use

test.

II. Defendant’s Provisional Theory of the Case

Defendant EchoCraft Productions is the prevailing party and seeks to affirm the district court’s

grant of summary judgment on both claims. EchoCraft’s position is that the district court correctly

concluded that no reasonable factfinder could find for Riven on either retaliation or copyright

infringement, even when the record is viewed in the light most favorable to him.

With respect to retaliation, EchoCraft will argue that Riven did not engage in protected activity

within the meaning of Title VII and that EchoCraft lacked knowledge that any internal inquiry by Riven

concerned opposition to unlawful gender discrimination. EchoCraft further maintains that Riven failed to

establish a causal connection between any alleged protected activity and his termination. Because Riven

could not satisfy the prima facie requirements of a retaliation claim, summary judgment was properly

granted.

With respect to copyright infringement, EchoCraft will argue that its song “Revere Paul Revere?”

constitutes fair use as a matter of law. EchoCraft contends that the song is transformative, that the nature

and amount of material used favors fair use, and that the use does not harm the potential market for

Riven’s work. On this record, EchoCraft maintains that no reasonable jury could find copyright

infringement, and that the district court correctly resolved the issue at summary judgment.

III. Plaintiff’s Anticipated Theory of the Case

Plaintiff Philip Riven is expected to argue that the district court improperly resolved disputed

issues of fact that should have been left to a jury. With respect to retaliation, Riven will likely contend that

his internal investigation into EchoCraft’s bonus assignment practices constituted protected activity under

Title VII because it was undertaken to determine whether the system discriminated on the basis of gender.

He will argue that EchoCraft was aware of this investigation and that his termination was causally

connected to that activity.

With respect to copyright infringement, Riven is expected to argue that EchoCraft’s song “Revere

Paul Revere?” infringed his copyrighted work “Revere Paul Revere” and that EchoCraft’s use is not

protected by the fair use doctrine. Riven will likely contend that the song is not transformative, copies a

substantial portion of his original lyrics, and harms the potential market for his work. He seeks reversal of

summary judgment and remand for further proceedings on both claims.

IV. Preliminary Overview of Facts

EchoCraft Productions is a music production company that employed Philip Riven beginning on

or about September 4, 2018, as a member of its country songwriting team. Riven received positive

performance feedback and was promoted in or around February 2020 to Manager of the country

songwriting department.

During his employment, Riven conducted an internal review of EchoCraft’s bonus assignment

practices. The parties stipulated that EchoCraft later terminated Riven’s employment, which constitutes an

adverse employment action for purposes of a retaliation claim. Separately, Riven is the author and

copyright holder of the song “Revere Paul Revere.” EchoCraft later released a song titled “Revere Paul

Revere?” The parties stipulated that Riven’s copyright is valid and that the song was not a work for hire.

Riven alleged that EchoCraft’s song infringed his copyright.

Riven filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging

retaliation in violation of Title VII and copyright infringement under the Copyright Act. EchoCraft moved

for summary judgment on both claims. The district court granted EchoCraft’s motion, concluding that

Riven failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation and that EchoCraft’s song constituted fair use as

a matter of law. Riven now appeals that final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the

Second Circuit.
