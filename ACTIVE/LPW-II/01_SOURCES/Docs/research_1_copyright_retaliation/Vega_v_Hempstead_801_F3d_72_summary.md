## KEY HOLDINGS FOR RETALIATION CLAIMS

### 1. Retaliation Claims Are Actionable Under § 1983
The court clarified that **retaliation claims alleging adverse action because of a complaint of discrimination are actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983**.

### 2. Pleading Standards for Discrimination/Retaliation (Post-Twombly/Iqbal)
- A plaintiff is **NOT required to plead a prima facie case** under *McDonnell Douglas* to survive a motion to dismiss
- Instead, plaintiff must only give **"plausible support to a minimal inference of discriminatory motivation"**
- The "prima facie case" is an **evidentiary standard**, not a pleading requirement

### 3. McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Framework
For analyzing employment discrimination under Title VII:
1. **Plaintiff establishes prima facie case** by showing:
   - (1) member of protected class
   - (2) qualified for position  
   - (3) suffered adverse employment action
   - (4) circumstances give rise to inference of discrimination
2. **Burden shifts to employer** to articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason
3. **Burden shifts back to plaintiff** to prove employer's reason was pretext

### 4. Adverse Employment Action Standard
- **Discrimination claims:** "materially adverse change in terms and conditions of employment"
- **Retaliation claims (broader):** any action that "could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination"

### 5. Causation Standards
- **Discrimination:** "motivating factor" (not but-for causation)
- **Retaliation:** requires "but-for" causation per *Nassar*, but can still be shown through **temporal proximity**

### 6. Temporal Proximity
"The causal connection needed for proof of a retaliation claim can be established indirectly by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse action."
- Five months is not too long to find causal relationship

## RELEVANCE TO RIVEN v. ECHOCRAFT

This case supports EchoCraft's position that:

1. **Riven failed to establish prima facie case** - Even under the minimal pleading standards, Riven needed to show (1) protected activity, (2) adverse action, (3) causation

2. **No temporal proximity** - Unlike *Vega* where adverse actions followed complaints within months, the record in Riven shows a lengthy internal investigation before any action was taken

3. **Legitimate nondiscriminatory reason** - EchoCraft conducted a thorough investigation (81 employees, 12 departments) before terminating Riven for copyright infringement concerns, satisfying the second prong of *McDonnell Douglas*

4. **But-for causation requirement** - Under *Nassar*, Riven must show retaliation was the but-for cause, not merely a motivating factor. The investigation findings provide independent justification.
