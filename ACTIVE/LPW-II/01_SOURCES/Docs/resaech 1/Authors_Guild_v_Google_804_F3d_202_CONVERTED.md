## KEY HOLDINGS FOR FAIR USE (17 U.S.C. § 107)

### The Four Fair Use Factors

#### Factor 1: Purpose and Character of the Use
- **Transformative use is central:** The more the copying serves a new, transformative purpose, the more it serves copyright's goal of enriching public knowledge
- A work is transformative when it "adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message"
- **Commercial motivation does not preclude fair use** - "the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism"
- Key quote: "Many of the most universally accepted forms of fair use, such as news reporting and commentary, quotation in historical or analytic books, reviews of books, and performances, as well as parody, are all normally done commercially for profit."

#### Factor 2: Nature of the Copyrighted Work
- Rarely plays a significant role in fair use determination
- The fact that original is factual vs. fictional doesn't automatically favor copying

#### Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality of Portion Used
- Copying entirety can still be fair use if "reasonably appropriate to achieve the copier's transformative purpose"
- What matters is not just amount copied, but **amount made accessible** to public as a substitute
- Even copying 100% can be fair use if done in a manner that doesn't offer competing substitute

#### Factor 4: Effect on Market (MOST IMPORTANT)
- "Undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use"
- Focuses on whether copy serves as **competing substitute** for original
- Close linkage with Factor 1: the more transformative, the less likely to be a market substitute
- "There must be a meaningful or significant effect upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work"
- Mere possibility of some loss of sales doesn't defeat fair use

### Key Principle: Transformative Purpose
A use is transformative when it:
- Communicates something new and different from the original
- Expands utility of the original
- Serves a different purpose than the original
- Does NOT merely "supersede the objects" of the original creation

## RELEVANCE TO RIVEN v. ECHOCRAFT

This case strongly supports EchoCraft's fair use defense:

### 1. Transformative Purpose (Factor 1)
- Like Google's search function, EchoCraft's song "Somebody Else's Story" **transforms** Riven's melody by:
  - Adding new lyrics with different message
  - Using melody in satirical/commentary context
  - Serving different purpose than original
- *Authors Guild* holds: "The more the appropriator is using the copied material for new, transformative purposes, the more it serves copyright's goal of enriching public knowledge"

### 2. Commercial Nature Doesn't Bar Fair Use
- *Authors Guild* explicitly rejects the Sony presumption that commercial use is presumptively unfair
- EchoCraft's profit motive doesn't preclude fair use when purpose is highly transformative

### 3. Minimal Market Substitution (Factor 4)
- EchoCraft's song does not serve as a "competing substitute" for Riven's original
- Different genre, different audience, different purpose
- *Authors Guild*: "the more the copying is done to achieve a purpose that differs from the purpose of the original, the less likely it is that the copy will serve as a satisfactory substitute"

### Connection to Campbell v. Acuff-Rose
*Authors Guild* extensively discusses and applies *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose*, the foundational parody/transformative use case that EchoCraft should rely on. Key points:
- Parody has "some claim to use the creation of its victim's imagination"
- Criticism/commentary on original justifies taking
- "Transformative works... lie at the heart of the fair use doctrine's guarantee of breathing space within the confines of copyright"
