SPEAKER 0
Yeah So now that you cry. No. so well. Sorry go ahead. Let's see, yeah, you're right, there's no solution yet, so

SPEAKER 1
it must just be, but it's just no.

SPEAKER 0
You. Sometimes. No, it's just gonna So Yeah, I was inviting myself.

SPEAKER 3
No, I was, yeah, but you literally just saw me

SPEAKER 0
eat dinner.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, I didn't know if you were gonna eat again. I thought that might be like a preference, so like you didn't have to eat a lot, you know. At this. People do that anyway, so that was kind of my

SPEAKER 0
thoughts.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so 1st 20 minutes students and then we and

SPEAKER 2
please feel free to jump in. Controlling. I think the focus also with my internal marks and then.

SPEAKER 0
A little bit of the focus about the service center. I. I like it, but again, I like to do a

SPEAKER 2
little. you jump in at any time you give them not.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, yeah, sounds good. like. Oh, you know what, actually. Also with this if you have this first, but I'm just gonna. Hello. Good evening. I'm doing so well. How are you? I'm also having some leftover bagel. I was trying to scavenging. Hi Neil. How are you doing? Yeah, just something. I don't know if you've done this already, but we're gonna post that on it, so it's helpful. We'll, we'll discuss briefly. Bye. I Your pulse is on courseworks too. Oh, did you already receive it? Did everybody on this side check? OK, wonderful. I'm so sad. I'm sorry, but I thought they were. This is extra. Oh, thank you so much. I'll keep it here for anyone else who comes, comes on in. That's Sure. wash it. Yeah, so the white color. So I guess that's. Not you. Yeah. Ashley here right. All righty. Hi everyone, good evening. Hello. I wanna thank everybody for your outlines.

SPEAKER 2
Um, I guess a couple of questions. Uh, how did it go with the group project on doing your outlines? Any, anyone want to just offer some general comments? Was it difficult working together as far as collating your, your points and how you wanted the statement of facts and what you thought the theory of the case should be? Things like that. Were there any issues presented and you don't have to, by the way, if it's, if it's really bad, you don't have to share those experiences, but just overall, you know, like I, I think I like to try to bring real world like life experiences and I, and I'm sure this is not the first time that all of you have done joint projects, uh, with other students or with co-workers and in that. in the work setting. But overall, did you find, considering that like we just, we just assigned you somewhat randomly, somewhat based on the survey, but, uh, you know, you were, you were asked to work together on issues and you know, you really only have less than a week to do a turnaround on outlines. Does anyone want to just share a little bit of that experience?

SPEAKER 0
Mhm. OK, I feel like it went pretty well. I have a good Max and Scarlett, right?

SPEAKER 2
OK, got you.

SPEAKER 3
I feel that we had a pretty good work.

SPEAKER 0
Gotcha.

SPEAKER 2
OK, yeah. Did you feel that like since you're being you are, are actually which, which issue were you covering? I'm retaliation copyright infringement. OK, gotcha. And did you feel that like trying to join your two issues as far as, did you feel like there was any overlap between your issues and how you would, you would be able to, um, sort of mesh that your theory of the, of the overall arching theory of your appeal and then the theory of your issues? Did they? Did they flow together? Did you find, or maybe you're still finding that we're

SPEAKER 0
kind of still finding, yeah, I still find it, but just totally fine. But I do think like as I was writing, I was kind of seeing more and more how like certain things overlap and how like we do kind of need to figure that out more. Got you, yeah, um, yeah, so that was interesting, right?

SPEAKER 2
Got it, yeah, and I find that even if you're an individual writer, I think you're gonna find that I think the best writing process is you're gonna go back and forth between your issue argument issue. Going back to your statement of facts, going back to, you know, your theory of the case, some of the argument, you, you're gonna find, I think, uh, oftentimes in the whole writing process and your self-editing process that you're gonna go back and forth, back and forth. I really do feel that that does produce at the end of the day, the strongest result and the most convincing case that you can give to the court as far as in your written form and in oral advocacy, so, uh, in oral arguments, so, good, continue keeping doing that. Anybody else just want to share any general thoughts?

SPEAKER 0
Yes, I think it also went pretty good.

SPEAKER 4
Um, I think we're also, me and Jeffrey are also still developing where we can kind of make one narrative and our theory of the case, um. But I think as I do more research. Probably come along, I think with like copyright specifically, I just was having a little bit of a hard time. Because I wanted to find cases with songs specifically because I feel like every copyright is kind of different, um, and he was able to help me out so I'm.

SPEAKER 2
Great, that's wonderful. And you are with, did you say Jeffrey, right? Yeah, got you. Yeah, great, uh, and copyright, so, uh, Jeffrey's handling the retaliation issue, right? Great. That's another theme too, uh, uh, I, I, I like what you pointed out was just sort of the, um, again, this theme about theory of the case also just helping each other out with your issues. You may have to, uh, they're fairly distinct issues, but I, again, something that I mentioned last week that I want you guys to keep in mind is that. Even as you're concentrating on, let's say, on the argument part on your own issues, one, be very familiar still, of course, with the other issue, um, because of a couple of reasons, you're partners, right? And you want to help each other out, and if, you know, another partner is maybe struggling with maybe trying to find case law slash how to argue, distinguish cases, um, uh, you, you wanna be there as a partner to try to help out as best you can, of course, right? And also, I just want you to keep in mind too that you know there's a thread that ties everything together in your brief. There may be two somewhat different issues, but there's, there's gonna be a theme, right, that ties together your client first of all, um, and maybe again keeping with the idea of what is your theory of the appeal, your theory of the case, your theory of the issues, and you wanna kind of make sure that the way it reads, right? The way your 0.1 reads, the way your 0.2 reads, that it doesn't seem to, um, Conflict or the, that there's not a tension between the two or that even that there's just sort of factual things and that theme that they don't conflict with each other. So again, this is just takes time, it's a process, you know, it's, it's not gonna, you know, you, you're going to write, you're going to edit, you're going to modify and you might find yourself, you just might find yourself sometimes thinking, all right. I got it down pat. I have my theory of the case. I have how I'm presenting it, and all of a sudden you discuss it with your partner and you realize, you know, you may have to more modify some of the points, tweak some of the things and one issue or the other issue, and that might also bleed over into how you're going to maybe have to amend your statement of the facts, right? I think the thing about statements that everything is tied together, right? I think you have to have a firm understanding of what the Your issues are and the arguments that you're gonna make to also be able to write up a statement of facts that are, uh, persuasive, honest, and complete, right? You have to deal with even the negative facts in your case, right? But you also have to have an understanding of what you need to put in a statement of facts, right? You know, as far as what's relevant, what's not as relevant, you know, what are, think about also as you're reading through writing and then modifying, editing your statement of facts, um. What is relevant, what's not relevant? Have you presented your fact statement of facts in a, in a way that's maybe as persuasive for your client and the position and the theme that you're trying to create? Now, this doesn't mean, of course, that you don't deal with the less favorable facts for your client, OK? You still have to address those, but addressing it in a way that perhaps you can kind of neutralize it as far as uh uh the, the, how it counters maybe, maybe a position that you're taking in for your client and stuff like that. Um, and, and it's a little bit of a, it's an art, you know, I have to say when I started as, as a As a writer, an appellate writer, and I mean, I still write appeals. I probably do more editing now than I actually do writing, mostly editing. Um, but I also found that, I found that writing up for us oftentimes uh for criminal appeals, it's the evidence at trial. And um I found it always to be in some ways. What was the most challenging because it's, in many ways, it's the most original part of your brief. It's how you're gonna write up the facts of the case and in the criminal appeals, at least, the kind of record on appeal that we're dealing with most of the time, it's the, the trial transcript, what happened below, the people's case and the witnesses' testimony. There might have been a defense case and the defense and the defense witness's testimony. And then kind of how do you present that story and then you have to be faithful and true to what the record on appeal states and what the witnesses' testimonies are, but then also presenting it in a way as the people, oftentimes I am the respondent, presenting it in a way that's also persuasive to the court where in some ways I'm able to neutralize some of the stuff. That might be a little bit not as favorable for the people's case while presenting it and, and, and sort of writing in a way that makes the reader kind of read it in a way where they can almost like, almost you kind of like the reader in which case it's the court, right? The judges on your panel where they, after they read the statement of facts, the, the statement of the statement of the case, that they can almost take a position already like they get a sense of like What the positions are, what the evidence was so that if you write it in such a way that's persuasive, the reader might already, already be taking position even before they address the points in, in, in, in the book. So I want you to kind of start thinking along those lines as you draft your brief, as you write it, as you edit it, as you self-edit it, as you edit each other, uh, and so I just wanted you to kind of keep those ideas in mind. Um, the, the handout that I gave you is something that, uh, Jacob, Jacob unfortunately could not be with us tonight. I know he is, uh, participating in a MOOC for competition in uh Long Island. Um, but I think it's very helpful and I would, I would, uh, encourage you, uh, to read it along, it, it actually complements a lot of the Newman readings that I had asked you to do for, for this week which had to do with again with the developing a pres uh theory of your case and, and also developing a persuasive like statement of facts. Um, so with the Newman readings, I think that were very helpful but I do think that this uh Writing the statement of the case in an appellate brief is also actually very, very helpful and I think hopefully it will help you again in guiding you as you write. And I just want to highlight just a few points in it. Before we break up into our little groups, and I'll explain what we'll do with our, our, our, our groups. Um, One of the things here, like it says here on page one, I actually thought were a couple of things that I really liked about this, um, But you'll read through it, but I'm just a little point out is that, as it says at the beginning actually of the, of the uh of the handout, it says that, you know, every component of an appellate brief is an opportunity to persuade the reader. And that the statement of the case, which is sometimes called the statement of facts, and again in other briefs like for example in criminal appeals that I handle, we call it the evidence at trial or the evidence below in the let's say the suppression hearing or irrelevant proceedings below, but it's basically a write up of the case of the record of the, of the, of the statement of the facts. It should convey to the reader a persuasive narrative about the factual scenario surrounding the legal action. And remember last term, right? You wrote memos, right? And you had statement of facts, a version of the statement of facts in the, in the, those legal memos, right? The open open memo, the closed memo. Now, in a, unlike a legal memo in which the reader will expect an objective recounting of the factual background, an appellate brief will typically seek to present the facts in a way that is advantageous to the client. But that's not to say, say that the statement of facts should be disingenuous, untruthful, or dismissive of unfavorable facts. Again, I think what you have to do in handling those uh uh less favorable facts honestly is just trying to find a way in, in, in, in ways that you can somehow maybe neutralize them as, as best as I can say or sort of say it in a way that makes it looks like, hey, it's actually not so bad for my client. Um, another thing I wanna stress too about um when you write up the statement of facts, remember this general rule, right? In your arguments, any reference to the record and the statement of facts or anything that, that is, you're going to support your arguments with the, with the, with the facts in your, in your, in your case, the record on appeal, you have to make sure that that was also in your statement of facts, right? So it has to be even, so you're going to do a little check on that, right? It cannot appear for the first time and only time in your argument. You have to make sure that it also appeared in your statement of facts. So that, so do keep that in mind. And that's also a good checks and balances in, in being able to say, hey, on my statement of facts, have I included all the relevant facts? Because if you're arguing, if you're referring to them in your argument, they must be pretty relevant, right? And then if you're looking at your statement of facts and looking to see. Do I need to trim it in any way? Um, Look at whether or not you're, any of those facts, you need them in your argument to either support your affirmative arguments or to counter what you anticipate will be the, you know, your counterarguments. And again, I realized too that you, you guys are a little bit at a disadvantage because for example, The appellant and the respondent here, uh, respondent typically is responding to the appellant's brief, right? They see the appellant's brief already and, um, they, they can somehow, and they can like make affirmative arguments, but then they can counter the appellant's arguments because they see the appellant's brief already. You're not doing that here. Everyone's doing a submission of the first time. They're anticipating arguments on the other side, uh, at least, at least the respondent is. So that way in real life, it's not quite the way it is in real life, but it's still an excellent exercise because at the end of the day, you're going to be making affirmative arguments. You're gonna be countering arguments that you anticipate will be, you know, the counter, the the, the adverse, uh, adverse position, um, and trying to counter that. So, um. With that said, and, and like I said, do, do keep in mind, uh, about this idea about incorporating your theory of the case and having that run throughout your brief from the statement of facts to your issues, both of your issues to your conclusion. So kind of keep in, keep in mind that thread. Um. So with the rest of our time for, for this evening, what I'd like to do is um we're going to break up our class into two groups. It'll be uh the Riven Group and the Echo Craft group, OK? So I know that you have pairings. Um, I do believe, I think the only student who's not here tonight, I believe is Moshe. So Neilam, I, I'm sorry, you'll be by yourself and speaking with your, with the, uh, you are with the Echo Craft Group, right? Gotcha. OK. So what we will do is, um, I just wanna make sure that I also have it correct here who our pairings are. Um, for the riven Group, we'll have Max and Scarlett, right? Um, Ashley and Almira pairings, right? Yes, and then Sydney and Una. OK. I'd like for the, uh, the six of you to meet together and I'll explain initially what you, what everyone will be doing, but then the other group, and I just wanna make sure too, the Echo Craft group. It's um Jeff, right? Jeff and uh Rihan, right? Yes, OK. And um Jack and Max, Max Liu, OK, and, uh, Moshe and Neilan, but Moshe is not here, so Neilan, I would like your group also to sit together and meet for the first, let's say about 15 minutes or so, 1520 minutes. I'd like you to just talk amongst yourself with your group. So your groups, in other words, are taking the same position. You're either Riven or you're Echo Craft. I'd like you to, in guiding your discussions, um, talk about your outlines, I guess, you know, things like about whether or not share your outlines too, you know, just talk about what, uh, maybe things like how you have, how you see sort of like your theory of the case. Keep in mind these other things, sharing what you think is the theory of the case, your position, um, things along the lines like, um, uh, I want you to think about also along the lines of discussing amongst each other, um, maybe things like what you think may be your strongest arguments in your, for your particular issues in your case. Um, share those thoughts, brainstorm together, um. And then also maybe also think about, and again, this is to help guide you in your discussions amongst each other. Think about maybe what you think will be um your most challenging facts, uh, issues, and uh maybe case law that you're gonna need to, to counter or overcome uh in, in your particular, for your, for your, for your case, for your client. So maybe things along those lines that will help guide you in your discussions. So we'll do that maybe. For about the 1st 15 minutes and then afterwards, uh, Clemens and I will join your group and, uh, I'm just, I will probably just sit with the, with the, uh, his last name Riven Riven, Riven, Riven Biden Riven group and then uh Clemens will sit with the Echo Craft group and then we'll just kind of go over some of your uh field questions. Questions that you might have, um, talk about your outlines, um, and just sort of go over some other couple of things. Probably what we will do too, and Clements, please guide yourself accordingly with your group and what, what they need, but, um, again, I think that what I would like to discuss are some of the answers to these, these questions that I was gonna ask you guys to brainstorm with each other and, and just even things like, um, Keep in mind about, again, tonight's theme is a little bit more about theory of the case, the statement of the facts, what are important facts for your case, for your client, and how you're going to present them, and then other ways in which you can, techniques that you can use to highlight those facts that are favorable to your client and techniques that you can use to be able to sort of, um, not so much bury but to try to um Minimize or neutralize maybe is the best way I can describe it, the facts that might not be as favorable for your client and again, leading towards the idea because you know what kind of arguments ultimately that you're gonna have to make in the argument section. I hope this makes sense, just some guidance on that. So, without further ado, if you could, uh, the Riven Group and the Echo Craft group, if you, whichever side you want, whoever wants to go to whoever's side. And then Clemens and I will join you in about 15 minutes, yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Let's see here Where we, yeah, OK, good.

SPEAKER 3
Where should we go? Just right here, sure, we already appointment.

SPEAKER 0
No. Oh But you don't die. Actually Right. What's up? OK get rid of Yeah, spelled out and I got him. I mean, maybe we can start with, I think the

SPEAKER 4
least, or no, we're not talking about retaliation, we're talking,

SPEAKER 3
are we talking we're talking about everything.

SPEAKER 0
Oh, OK, I think the email that you sent is

SPEAKER 4
really bad just to see like how for example how

SPEAKER 0
to effectively. OK, sure, that'll be great because I figured like if

SPEAKER 1
we practice this together you mentioned like it's probably the

SPEAKER 0
worst because you had it after, uh, it was like this guy would buy like I was gonna say I'm, I'm I think I'm also I'm in mine so. Oh, that's right, no, I'm not kidding. Yeah, I, I was able to do an announcement but, yeah, I feel like I think like maybe it's a

SPEAKER 1
generational thing. Oh, sure it isn't.

SPEAKER 0
Well, I'm gonna, so for you. So you know how we have our strengths and weak

SPEAKER 2
res, but like just to be fair, none of this

SPEAKER 6
suggests that he was aware that it was a Title VII violation.

SPEAKER 0
All right, so, and like I guess this is the

SPEAKER 6
case was like the facts or you want to put some on one of these, so show me how you

SPEAKER 0
look. What's your approach? I theology because it's like the evidence the employer has to and it's even if it's not wait, wait, no, but my, my is.

SPEAKER 2
Download that so I feel like one of the strongest

SPEAKER 3
points in that case all that was fine with this more like the yeah the like I was element was I'm pretty sure so very good it has to like

SPEAKER 0
one of our strongest points is that there was such clear evidence that he was underperforming for a period that you wouldn't want to stay. Yeah, she so so she says she's like just for

SPEAKER 3
like I feel like that's one of the, uh, I

SPEAKER 4
don't know because like in my mind the ended yeah I agree. I think there was just the other because I'm like Jessie or I don't know that didn't get fired even though she was coming to. I feel like there has to.

SPEAKER 0
I like scientist definitely stressing what they stress so this

SPEAKER 3
would be this. I don't know why he was that he was so quickly like of this like even like.

SPEAKER 0
Now we have to the definition said that she had like a long history on it. It's no longer true for like 2 years.

SPEAKER 4
It said she had like place and she bounced back

SPEAKER 0
she's like a, she's like a veteran at the firm,

SPEAKER 6
so like there's like there's like more loyalty going on there.

SPEAKER 0
Which are in another section in the record.

SPEAKER 3
What about the fact they're going to bring up the fact that even though it was not, uh, explicitly titled like 7 investigation that ribbon brought up the fact that under the groups they were talking about were. Ones with more women, you know, how do you counter the fact that it's so you're opening a new window?

SPEAKER 1
Apparently you did say that when you brought the stipulations

SPEAKER 0
from whoever it was the fact that like it wasn't

SPEAKER 4
very clear in the email that it was a title

SPEAKER 0
violation, um, and I think what do we call it

SPEAKER 4
whoever the manager is is um.

SPEAKER 0
But anyway, that glanced over the email.

SPEAKER 4
Someone just glances over the email. It's not very clear, and even when you look at the table, the discrepancies don't make sense for the gender violation, I think, yeah, um, for like women, I think it's like the last people, um, the female like bonus at the bottom was more than males, right, so it doesn't like make, uh, it doesn't raise a flag in someone's head. It's like, oh, they caught us, yeah, so I was,

SPEAKER 0
OK, I think we're basically just talking about. In different ways, like I, I did include that, yeah, you did, I didn't say like, but not like, yeah, yeah, no, I don't think you need to get it, but I think again like it was the same thing I'd be like, although like he wrote my email he wrote the even in the email he didn't mention it and that's like so I just think I need to go back on them and apply. Yeah, I feel like my, uh, they gave him a

SPEAKER 4
warning because he, yeah, started performing better, and I think he did use like a lot of his time at work if he interviewed what was it 60 or 80 people. There was no way he was doing that outside of hours.

SPEAKER 5
There's like a possible for like, but then there's a possible correlation between him using this much time to do the investigation and actually underperforming the way that they accused slash sighted.

SPEAKER 0
I don't know. I found a couple cases that the 3 people weren't transferred out of until July and they are January. I don't know whether they're that helpful because when I do I'm not.

SPEAKER 3
I also like he just didn't like control for like anything like he was like such a right.

SPEAKER 1
So what, what do we have the investigation was just

SPEAKER 3
like so not extensive whatsoever. Really it was just basically like was there a difference, yeah, so like as opposed to looking at why that

SPEAKER 0
like drag it or that that person was great nice nice circuit, and then also like the sample yeah it

SPEAKER 5
makes absolutely no sense like did they, did you control

SPEAKER 3
for like years and I thought those were a little bit more like nothing like that, right, but again like

SPEAKER 0
I feel like that's a really on that. And I said how can you like one of them

SPEAKER 5
apartment 4 men anyone else of hiss and then site

SPEAKER 0
that it on the camera but like, OK, how is

SPEAKER 4
it one of the average of like that's not, yeah, I want you to write like females have higher bonuses on like having these.

SPEAKER 0
Really, I think, uh, like I was thinking about the

SPEAKER 3
policy, and I guess this kind of goes into like theory of the case, so like what we wanna talk

SPEAKER 1
about you can run up on the tell you to us.

SPEAKER 3
I'm pretty clear you don't want to read this one people to just be able to hide behind. A false claim to protect themselves from like a lawful and legitimate termination and retaliatory feels like such a or

SPEAKER 0
if you say OK, maybe they didn't know that and you can see that by the time was able to

SPEAKER 3
do this it seems like numerous like just countless laws along the same lines where they could provide similar evidence

SPEAKER 0
like copyright infringement like weak evidence. I, I.

SPEAKER 3
That seems like just is that a terrible waste of resources, but you're only offering that like they're, you know what I mean? Yeah, where do you draw that line?

SPEAKER 0
I just don't know.

SPEAKER 3
I mean you can allow to be like, wait, does that go on the analysis retaliation and I think causation

SPEAKER 0
of him I think you can go. I think it is there's there's 4 things that you

SPEAKER 4
have approved for retaliation and the retaliation.

SPEAKER 0
I think like part of the retaliatory action. That was in your section you'd be like, yes, this is copyright infringement because X, Y, Z, therefore it's part of it's, I mean, I feel like also with respect to what you're talking about before, like whether the thing

SPEAKER 3
that just trips me up is like we're basically we're saying like should I feel like you can have gone to trial versus not before his firing that we're already

SPEAKER 0
clear it's that we retaliation he had already dropped below his quotas should have gone to trial, um, prior to his first notice.

SPEAKER 3
Because you they need all four elements. So is there like one element that is the weakest, you think?

SPEAKER 0
That because as long as you can prove that that

SPEAKER 3
that there was a stand against it, yeah, because like

SPEAKER 0
in the past quotas it did lower like they didn't do anything about it and didn't seem to not yeah

SPEAKER 2
yeah and I feel like I also took so that was kind of like the first step exactly the same so this was no yeah, I just wanted to make sure, exactly, exactly, yeah, exactly and that's why after the

SPEAKER 0
email she was like he was like juicy about this. I know. Did you find any case about something. Yeah, I mean, I know that there's like implicit direction. Honestly, I just feel like, honestly, I spent so much

SPEAKER 3
time with the years like it seems like coming to me with a you have to provide a little more evidence that that you were just doing something on the

SPEAKER 0
protective activity part, no, I feel like. I did, yeah, I just want to double check that

SPEAKER 6
and then do so much less on like causation.

SPEAKER 0
I didn't do a ton on the protective. I don't think that's so interesting. I didn't do a ton on protected. Oh yeah, yeah, I didn't.

SPEAKER 6
And then, well, I feel like tell me more because

SPEAKER 0
I was just like, oh, obviously I think there's like the to do a certain like they're.

SPEAKER 3
yeah, excellent reviews prior to this, yeah, so like 5. I feel like that's just I don't, I don't everybody

SPEAKER 0
does, yeah, like the opposition cause it's like he was

SPEAKER 6
doing like the effects even he didn't know it was

SPEAKER 0
unlawful, that good I think I can.

SPEAKER 3
But then again, a year, just a year of underperformance is not that crazy, and I'll send you what I

SPEAKER 0
have for the other one.

SPEAKER 3
Wait, did you all know they told us exactly how

SPEAKER 4
much he was underperforming, right?

SPEAKER 3
Well, I think it said like he had to reach 25. I have a question about that actually.

SPEAKER 1
I think it's good if we practice this. I think it will give you like, it will make it easier for you as you move through they're like,

SPEAKER 0
and then maybe next year, next year if you're doing

SPEAKER 3
this they're, you're no longer dependent.

SPEAKER 0
I, yeah, that's fine, but it's not I think it

SPEAKER 2
would be also a great skill to, you are absolutely right. I should become more self-san I don't know that that's

SPEAKER 0
good to know. I think there's a bunch of questions about what actually well, I handle this one, so I think even not

SPEAKER 2
to say that I didn't say I won't mess underperforming in 202 I am definitely that's why projects during business

SPEAKER 5
hours, however, so long as an announcement.

SPEAKER 0
A week or something like it's too much to talk about overwhelming it's fine and then they explicitly say it

SPEAKER 5
doesn't interfere with quotas, it's fine, which is sort of a pretty clear precedent for the fact that like if he doesn't meet quotas, it's a fireable effect.

SPEAKER 0
Um, page 9190 of the PDF. I think so that's over a year before citing that

SPEAKER 5
like he does have problems already and then the next year then they say he hasn't met his quotas basically for employment he's already been set in a previous review that was given to him.

SPEAKER 4
That was before the whole entire investigation too.

SPEAKER 3
I think that's actually oh yeah like it's not that

SPEAKER 5
he didn't, you know, they were aware of him doing

SPEAKER 0
other things sent an email and the employee, but then

SPEAKER 3
again, then they're going to say, oh, future potential Mr. Ruben certainly it's a bright future that could crack if he keeps it up, so they're gonna say. Oh, it's like not that big a deal if he keeps it up, if he doesn't like at the end

SPEAKER 0
of the day like it's at will employment's not meeting quotas and then whenever it doesn't happen totally know you won't even have to think about it anymore, right, excellent. It might be like a brutal culture, but at the

SPEAKER 5
same time, right, excellent, yeah, I remember seeing it.

SPEAKER 2
I had. See you which side of this rhythm, which side of

SPEAKER 6
like as long as like the viral offense, they cannot prove like it's above or even if it is true that like this guy we, we were aware like say it's a type of violation, it's like we would have fired been able to fire him without this, right, but

SPEAKER 3
they're gonna say like.

SPEAKER 0
But one like you know things yeah, sorry, so it's.

SPEAKER 3
Sorry, I put my plate there.

SPEAKER 0
Don't worry, but we can sit in it if you want. What's everyone doing. You guys all look super tired.

SPEAKER 5
It's a Thursday the energy.

SPEAKER 1
OK, let's, let's get through this, and then everybody can

SPEAKER 0
do it. Perfect.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so what's you guys are all echo craft, right?

SPEAKER 0
Is that like, yeah, they're gonna be like, well, she has been a little bit longer. I think that like what they gave her a longer lead.

SPEAKER 3
gonna smoke that. No, yeah, I think, uh, we all are thinking pretty so we kind of only talked about the retaliation element before you even think we need to get to talking about the copyright issue yet, but, uh, where will you smoke your? Well, we were actually just talking about pretty much the weak points in our argument, uh.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, yeah, you suggested the email, yeah, because she has knowledge, yeah, exactly because she knew not to get involved because she knew it would lash out.

SPEAKER 3
I mix up the names of like who's who, but

SPEAKER 0
that might be, it's important. I'm so sorry. I don't mean to interrupt, but the CEO of your

SPEAKER 1
company wrote an email to the other side. What is the virus, he said like ribbon seems like

SPEAKER 3
a virus to the company or something along that doesn't

SPEAKER 0
look good it doesn't look great for us.

SPEAKER 1
So how are you dealing with that. How are we dealing with that?

SPEAKER 4
He didn't say in this, that it was the like the gender discrimination thing. He didn't say anything about Title VII. He's just saying that he's saying something he's a distraction,

SPEAKER 1
right, but why is he a distraction? Why is he like why is? Brain perceiving this investigation so negatively because he's are you

SPEAKER 2
finding as far as taking people outside of work and

SPEAKER 4
asking them a bunch of questions and if this was

SPEAKER 1
just like a normal like routine investigation, couldn't the guy just, I don't know, just kind of be a little bit more relaxed? Does he have to be that aggressive? I think it shows or it suggests at least this person's being triggered somehow.

SPEAKER 0
He's passionate about his job.

SPEAKER 6
I saw the potential of of invested so much like confidence and trust last night. Now this guy's like here to get us. Like just think about the disappointment. So you think Ray is just full of passion and

SPEAKER 1
he just loves his job with the like I mean

SPEAKER 5
you could also make the case that he feels like his company is being targeted and it's not necessarily for discrimination. He just says this employee has a vendetta against us, so he can just be doing an investigation does not like there's no particular clear target. It's not really like. Gender discrimination, it's not for whatever. He's just going to collect a bunch of numbers and then come up with a predatory theory to like destroy the PR of the company, which is like a justifiable reason for concern and a reasonable fact finder could not

SPEAKER 3
assume that this email indicates that he's just aware that the precise feelings of, uh, wasn't there also another email

SPEAKER 1
to sniff? Didn't he like write something along the lines of, hey, we have all of this gender stuff and then.

SPEAKER 5
Oh, from ribbons, I know there was one. So, yeah, like bonus, yeah, but is there any indication

SPEAKER 3
that sniff, first of all, I think you can make an argument that sniff was not even fully aware that it was a protected activity and even so that rain was the one more responsible responsible for determination.

SPEAKER 1
But look at the scope of this year and interviewed 81 employees and 12 departments and then. Mentioned sexual harassment training.

SPEAKER 0
There were the efficacy.

SPEAKER 1
The women I interviewed were on average awarded lower bonus compensation than men. Isn't this like as straightforward as it gets? Like, wasn't at least this one leading figure aware of discrimination?

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, it's so we looked at the numbers on the table, and well like I think you pointed out that one, it's not clear that on average I can. And they're somewhere here, but not all of them are actually like a lot a lot of earning higher bonuses than the men, and also the sample sizes do not indicate clear averages. So in some cases there's teams where the total number of men on the team is like 8, but he interviews 1 and he cites 1 man as the average bonus. That seems like a pretty targeted way of lowering or skewing the numbers. So getting at the statistics, yeah. So like, is he clearly picking groups. Of people that will skew his numbers and like again coming up with like a targeted scheme to affect what the bottom line of this actual survey is like is the survey accurate? Is the survey skewed like the way he conducted the survey, it doesn't seem like it's a purely benevolent thing when you look at the numbers overall. He can cite as many departments as he wants, but if you talk to one person in that department and cite them as an average. It doesn't seem like a really great statistical thing to

SPEAKER 2
do.

SPEAKER 6
Also, like a reasonable person wouldn't. You immediately think that it's like gender discrimination because someone at like a Christmas party said that our department is getting lower bonus. Like there's this case called Clark County which is like

SPEAKER 1
similar, um, what are, what are the facts of the case? Yeah, so basically there was like this employee like overheard

SPEAKER 6
like in like a meeting where like the male employees were like making like sexual remarks about like employees. Like it was pretty bad. Like, like what they were saying was like I hear like making love to you is like making love to the. Grand Canyon and like and and and like and then like the the the Supreme Court is like ok but this is just like like one remark it doesn't like count and so so like he's saying that like a reasonable person can't just like hear this like one like remark and think that there's like a systemic issue, right? So like here's like the saying it's like this like Christmas party and you have like your coworkers saying oh this year, like a single year by the way, like 2022 like our department's getting a little. Lower bonus than you and like this wasn't like even implicating my gender it's just saying like he just happens to know that like your department has like more women and like his department has like more men and then he immediately like jumps to like a strong suspicion like oh this must be like a systemic discrimination that's just not reasonable.

SPEAKER 1
What's like the most harmful uh precedent case to your argument that you could find, uh, like there's this which

SPEAKER 2
ones are a little bit less favorable and then like

SPEAKER 6
I forgot what it's called. Well for you was it the one with like the Colombia? I forgot what the name is like that is it

SPEAKER 0
like versus Manorhan or something versus Colombia already digested for

SPEAKER 2
you, right? There were things are almost like summarized for you Menorahan

SPEAKER 3
versus summarized so she's actual documents what type of case

SPEAKER 0
that you then have to kind of call from and stuff so. Another thing I wanted to keep, I think, yeah, this

SPEAKER 5
one's more in our favor, right? Yeah, this one's um, there's going to be precedents that

SPEAKER 1
harm you, and I'm trying to press you about how you deal like with difficult cases or with cases that speak against like there's plenty ones where you need to

SPEAKER 6
like that says that like you just need like some like reasonable suspicion or like like. Like, whereas, like, like, even if the company is really just like, OK, they're not actually discriminating like as long as like the employee reasonably like thinks that um what they're like investigating is like for like just like cause like off you know but imagine how like your opponent

SPEAKER 1
would frame this like you guys look you'll make very sensible arguments and We have statistics and we have precedence, but think about the strongest argument that the other side, like what are they going to argue? Are they, are they going to challenge you? And also just how do you come across? Like do you wanna be like a coldhearted company that just, uh, doesn't pay women? Like what if you have like a feminist judge or what if like the judge has like very serious like equal protection leanings like. How do you want to portray it?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, the inference you're like this is like this thing or like this. It could be like one of these statistics are good,

SPEAKER 1
but it already looks a little bit like, oh, there's this quote, it's like in like this very much intuitively many people might find that like the little guy standing up a little bit. I think that could be an issue like just for

SPEAKER 0
for storytelling like something that I don't know if this

SPEAKER 5
is like against a specific. Precedent case, but something that could be helpful then is to frame it so in the email he mentions that like all the there's a great policies for paid leave for maternity leave for like all of those things to sort of frame it as like we're a company that actively likes to protect all employees including women. There's like very satisfactory sexual harassment trainings and like protection things in place so to say that and and then again to point to the sample size and sort of what looks to be in a lot of ways. Huge statistics. It seems like there's an intent to make it look like the company's policies are discriminatory when the reality of the actual satisfaction of the employees there, including women, seems to be on average quite great. And so there's, I think it's basically, it's not to say like it's not contesting the numbers, but just sort of contesting position that you're taking like the way the narrative, yeah, the narrative like it seems like there is an intent. To skew the results of the survey to begin with, and that sort of supports the bent narrative a little bit of, yeah, I think that that's an excellent way

SPEAKER 1
to frame this. I would try to argue that, hey, we're actually like maybe not a feminist company, but we're like for equal protection. You don't wanna be like the misogynist like it's, it's

SPEAKER 5
important to our company, like, you know, uh, what is,

SPEAKER 0
what's the role of physician and it might be something

SPEAKER 1
she's like a supervisors general manager of all of that. She's like a seniorwriters, so there's like, are you guys,

SPEAKER 5
women in senior leadership, like they have great policies, like all of those things. It doesn't show like a clear cases like only men at the top actively like systemically doing anything bad to, to use the like menorah hand example again like that precedent supports us in that, it must show clear unlawful discrimination. Numbers don't show unlawful discrimination. They just show a trend. You'd have to then question. The basis for which like bonuses and things like that are calculated and that would require separate findings so this just shows the dissatisfaction which doesn't frame frame it like

SPEAKER 1
that women in leadership position sexual harassment training exists because I do feel that like people are happy that's, that's

SPEAKER 4
a much better story and I think you can look at every specific line and like the lines where women have higher bonuses and just be like I think that it is maybe. Sit 50/50 if there's an infirmance it's hopefully and also

SPEAKER 5
in a in a decent number of the places where men are excited to have higher bonuses it sound like they actively leave out like a good chunk of the men in those sorry, uh, everything was done, yeah, like they either leave out the men or the women could really skew the figures of like top or bottom right so they they've just chosen like the highest paid men in that department as checks and balances, which is great. Like like skewed what it looks like. Like I'm looking at the last two tables and it's 50/50 between men and what else do we have?

SPEAKER 1
What do you think is the most challenging factor or

SPEAKER 0
issue to overcome? Like what do you think? I just, what, what does your gut feeling?

SPEAKER 1
How do you feel about this? Like just here listening to this? What's your impression? But yeah.

SPEAKER 2
But Max, that's a good question though, and I do think that, um, do you think this is a straightforward

SPEAKER 1
case that I think you would I tried to cite

SPEAKER 0
something in the record that will support that. I also think it's good too because. convince me.

SPEAKER 1
Aren't there any facts at all that are maybe challenging for the echo craft and then in the argument too.

SPEAKER 0
Sometimes I felt I just read something.

SPEAKER 2
They want to be able to go back to the record and say where does, where does that say that

SPEAKER 0
you're gonna talk about this you you don't want them

SPEAKER 1
to have to feel free to just talk about uh the entire thing regarding the I feel like that that

SPEAKER 0
supports that like the amount kind of because we took like 7 to 8 lines like straight out to go back to.

SPEAKER 2
To the record to to to see so it's really

SPEAKER 6
hard to argue like the arguing that you only took what was necessary when you agree to the entire song you want to draw and stuff. So but then again I feel like all the time

SPEAKER 0
you have to you're you're like in the same market

SPEAKER 6
like both songs are used in the educational markets.

SPEAKER 1
But yeah, I also say so you think that's going to be more difficult, yeah. Does everyone else think, does anyone else have thoughts on,

SPEAKER 4
um, for the like same market kind of thing, I mean, he was trying to profit off of it and I think our strongest point was that we did give it to a school. We did get $200 but that's nothing. I think the strongest point is that it's for nonprofit use, um, and I think while 7 lines or how many lines were used in the original song, the last line, which changes the meaning of the whole entire song and like makes him sound like a, a traitor kind of thing, I think, um, one of the songs makes him sound like he's good, and they like Paul Ribbons and the other one, like the whole meaning of the song is completely changed.

SPEAKER 2
Um, um, but, so you're going back to the decision

SPEAKER 0
now of the views, but you definitely mentioned nonprofit educational,

SPEAKER 4
yeah, you know, if you have, I think those are probably our two strongest points that is good.

SPEAKER 0
That's, that to me is, and I'm just looking at

SPEAKER 1
the statute here. I see they're using like phrases like amount and substantiality, and I think the words like that they're almost. Certainly going to be contested like in in in the case like almost certainly people have thought about what this means yeah, the amount 100% very bad report correctly found

SPEAKER 4
how substantial the last line is gonna be so I

SPEAKER 1
would definitely look at precedence here, it's hard to also

SPEAKER 0
precedence that like again maybe it may not be alone is enough like you're gonna have more countering.

SPEAKER 2
You know, as far as the word both words are

SPEAKER 6
used for like the same commercial purpose, but you know,

SPEAKER 0
I think what I saw. I guess we could argue for like the nonprofit that you know so what I'm hearing is you guys expect

SPEAKER 1
maybe to win on retaliation but not so much on copyright confusing.

SPEAKER 0
If there's not one not right on a 4 part test, I think we could exactly like even on the,

SPEAKER 2
the nonprofit part, at least there's an issue, a reasonable

SPEAKER 4
back where they were giving, I don't know, I think it was universities or something, and um, they ruled in favor of the universities because they were nonprofits for educational purposes.

SPEAKER 1
You think these issues connect somehow like if let's say Paul Ribbons really loses on. Retaliation will that influence the copyright issue somehow?

SPEAKER 4
Honestly, I feel I'm having a hard time seeing how they connect issues.

SPEAKER 5
I feel like that potentially they could and that like if I think they win or if Ribbon wins on the copyright claim, so I think stronger case to be made that like the company was sort of bitter and fired him in retaliation to not being able to like. Full on his work or like or trying to take full credit for his work and then just sort of kick him out to not have any sort of backlash

SPEAKER 2
and I think that that's also like when I, I'm

SPEAKER 0
sort of thinking how I would craft it.

SPEAKER 6
I mean, I mean just like if we went on the retaliation like it's less easy it's harder for them to argue that like the reason why we even like did this song specifically was to also retaliate against it like like we didn't really like. If we're not making money off this review part of view question mark, so you're saying you want me to

SPEAKER 1
establish like a track record of credibility, but like if

SPEAKER 6
they can't prove retaliation, they can't say that we did this together and we're not making money.

SPEAKER 2
And forgive me if I keep this, I'm repeating myself here, but I guess like if, if you, if you

SPEAKER 1
like in the first case can show that you guys are like super credible, you're absolutely trustworthy. I think that could like again go to this issue of storytelling to or the second issue is being perceived

SPEAKER 4
I think also the timeline I think he was fired and then like whatever rain found the song after he was fired if I'm remembering the facts correctly it's never

SPEAKER 2
one shot deal because he was looking through his desk, OK, I got it all or something like after he

SPEAKER 4
had left and then you write up your right.

SPEAKER 2
You know, you write it. I, I guess that can show that they weren't connected

SPEAKER 4
because it happened afterwards.

SPEAKER 2
It, it, there's a sense maybe, I don't know.

SPEAKER 1
Wouldn't it also show the opposite like that?

SPEAKER 4
Well, if he didn't know about it until he left

SPEAKER 2
it as persuasive way, but if like he could have

SPEAKER 0
just said, it doesn't the company doesn't have like ownership

SPEAKER 6
cut against, like he was working there again what I

SPEAKER 3
said about making sure that I think that you are doing your.

SPEAKER 0
She was issues make sure, right, that they were also

SPEAKER 2
in Europe, but it sounds like you guys do this.

SPEAKER 1
Storytelling women leadership positions, um, maternity leave, all that stuff, mm, ideally present yourselves as credible, carry that over into the second work with precedents. Look also not only like for the cases that speak for you but also for the strongest case that the other side could bring and then see like how, how would you deal with a really strong. Precedent that just speaks with the issues that have to be what are you actually asking me?

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, just a hypothetical case that speaks against, uh, I

SPEAKER 3
think you want the your main purpose is to distinguish it in an important way, but it's pretty good like. If it was a very identical situation, but the other company was not a credible, uh, equal protecting, yeah, I

SPEAKER 1
think you had a like very specific niche jobs like country music departments. There's only whatever precedent you're going to find is going to consider something different, hey, this is a different situation for whatever reason like this is the creative industry.

SPEAKER 0
distinguishing is good but we are digesting also like um

SPEAKER 1
transcripts we talked about the start like just openly acknowledging facts like not not trying to hide them, not trying to sweep them under the rug just saying and maybe this is so but we have 3 other reasons why why why we are right nonetheless.

SPEAKER 0
That makes sense.

SPEAKER 1
That's what I, no, I mean for the copyright, depending

SPEAKER 4
on the case, I feel like it's very different based on the research. Like songs are a very, I don't know, um, how do I explain this and like and they bring up a case with, for example, someone copying a book or something. I can just say that like the way that this act was made, they were trying to say like very creative pieces and that the book doesn't line with this

SPEAKER 2
kind of not, not true.

SPEAKER 0
Based off of and I think we're also giving you

SPEAKER 1
guys written comments at some point. I have to double check what, what exactly we comment on, but we will also like pages lead you into stuff and then try to like talk to you if we notice something, you know.

SPEAKER 0
And sometimes when we're writing into like page limit issues

SPEAKER 2
because there are page and word count issues, I don't, you know, we have to justify why I'm, I'm filing

SPEAKER 0
an oversized briefing.

SPEAKER 1
How's everything else going for you guys?

SPEAKER 0
We gave a bunch of How's your life going? Well, it's going pretty well. Are you doing like any recruiting? Uh, yeah, just finishing up recruitment for, uh, 2L and

SPEAKER 3
now starting to figure out my 1 job.

SPEAKER 1
I wanna, so everybody has a 2L book at this point. I don't know if everybody does, uh, but you guys

SPEAKER 3
are. I have a job for next summer. How much of that.

SPEAKER 0
in the same boat. I don't know what I'm doing this.

SPEAKER 1
I know what I'm doing next. It's crazy that you're doing.

SPEAKER 0
I, I only do PI this summer you gonna do?

SPEAKER 3
I don't know. I'm still figuring it out like when I'm going to do something, uh, I just don't know yet. Maybe. Oh, I really don't know, but it's like a. I, I'm gonna cast a wide it see what I get. So some places have or like a like to do

SPEAKER 0
like I wanted to do like LBMH or like Chanel

SPEAKER 5
like an in-house I don't like fuck around, yeah, no,

SPEAKER 4
I just, yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Me too. Oh, I'm serious.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, I didn't even think of that. I love. I'm gonna, they're, I think they're GC and Columbia a

SPEAKER 0
lot a lot. I'm going to hit them up if they, I'll let

SPEAKER 5
you know because I know I want to do anything. I think this is my only time to explore exactly,

SPEAKER 3
yeah, I think that that.

SPEAKER 5
And there's uh the GC of Conde Nast so there's a lot of like like I don't know if that means we'll have anything, but I was like there's no

SPEAKER 0
emails, yeah, OK, yeah, so just sending emails.

SPEAKER 5
There's an application, uh, not that I've seen, but I'm just gonna call the email and be like hey, OK.

SPEAKER 0
What are you up to? OK, we'll see what they say. Oh, you guys, you guys have like summer jobs.

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, I have like a job for next summer, but

SPEAKER 0
not this one. I like, where are you going?

SPEAKER 1
What are you doing?

SPEAKER 6
I don't know. Like, I don't know what I want to do yet. Like, like she just like, like she just like, yeah,

SPEAKER 0
like, but like, wait, there's, I would, OK, my strategy

SPEAKER 5
was just like find a bunch of. Columbia, a lot, a lot who are GCs in house and then just like hit them up and be like

SPEAKER 4
hey and like just see if they have anything in

SPEAKER 5
them because some of them do.

SPEAKER 1
You can use a lot, especially if you introduce yourself and say, hey, I'm a student. I'm interested in this and that, and then it's really easy to they love it.

SPEAKER 5
The GC open AI can be a guy that could be like a cool one, yeah, Steven. It's like next year, yeah, exactly.

SPEAKER 0
Well, it would be fun. It's super, yeah, uh, which isn't, there's a lot of like stuff in there and there's some in the summary judgment motion it's not actually raised at all, but it's raised in the law. I just look up companies that you're interested in law.

SPEAKER 5
It's not they mentioned, but they're just like no, but I like talks and then don't talk.

SPEAKER 4
I start going to. I started s OK, wait, are they with me?

SPEAKER 5
They're very funny, really?

SPEAKER 4
Oh my God, I love, I want to get enrolled too somehow.

SPEAKER 0
I know it's like the new I see right now they have some sort of specialized program.

SPEAKER 4
I've been hearing that they're really cool.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, I don't, I don't know if Columbia has specific

SPEAKER 4
classes or like electives. I know even at NYU there is, but I would

SPEAKER 1
do like intellectual property. copyright I guess that's what interests you because that's like

SPEAKER 0
some of them have like business teams too, which is

SPEAKER 5
