SPEAKER 0
To like 42 and I take the one train. But I find sometimes the one train can be a little unpredictable. It can get, like, you know, so, do you guys live in the area, or I live in East Harlem.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, OK.

SPEAKER 2
I live 5 minutes from here. Got you, yeah, so, um.

SPEAKER 0
I, I figured I guess we will, we, we will have two students educated. and so we sent you this form also for attendance.

SPEAKER 2
So if if somebody reaches out to you, feel free to just edit this. Otherwise we'll just do whatever we say. Thank you so much.

SPEAKER 0
I really appreciate that. Great, wonderful. Hi Sydney, how are you? Happy New Year. Happy New Year to you. Can I have the same North Face jacket, we'll probably

SPEAKER 0
I just figured maybe first class.

SPEAKER 2
that in the house. I'm gonna go through the schedule but it was about two weeks ago. 00 yeah. So you don't have to deal with. I'd like I can go back in there. Yeah, introduce yourself. awesome, um, would you feel comfortable. About problems that bit of the issues that sort of you feel comfortable in doing that and then we Um,

SPEAKER 0
I want something more like many things that I think that they should look for, um, but I also really do really, I kind of, so I kind of figured we can do it with those and that, so that's

SPEAKER 1
OK.

SPEAKER 0
And also come and forgive me and.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, um, I realized, you know what, you could probably,

SPEAKER 0
uh, disregard what I said because when I looked a

SPEAKER 2
little bit more closely at some of the sort of the teaching notes and stuff and the structures, I guess I really, yeah, yeah, I like that. I know I've actually been really to go on this because there's this teaching brand, the Nancy's brand of yogurt

SPEAKER 0
that I realized that is like very much the the

SPEAKER 2
best thing, and here is like they have it at Whole Foods and. want us to consult with students within your class or outside of yeah, yeah, no, I meant more like our

SPEAKER 0
courses, yeah, so disregard, it's really more I realize it's

SPEAKER 2
gonna be naturally built in the way we. What I wanna say I was about to say you

SPEAKER 0
disregard my very confusing comment or question, but I figured

SPEAKER 2
I would just tell you this.

SPEAKER 0
I think it's gonna be just built in natural and stuff like that, so, right.

SPEAKER 2
How are you? Mhm. OK. You too so. Cos. But It's not, so it's like how many. What Yeah Yeah. I You Bless you. Hi. Good. Happy New Year, Max.

SPEAKER 0

SPEAKER 0
Oh, thank you so much.

SPEAKER 2
I appreciate it. Thank you. Walking swimming. I need be. Where.

SPEAKER 0
All right, everybody, I guess we'll just get started. I know that maybe uh others some of your fellow students will be hopefully, uh, strolling in soon. Um, first of all, welcome back. Uh, Happy New Year. Happy to start our second semester of legal practice workshop. Um, I, I just wanted you to know I, I really had a great experience, as you know, it's my first semester, first year teaching a legal practice workshop, and I feel that we had a really, really fruitful, I hope, hopefully fruitful first semester, um, you know, with starting out with legal writing here and, um, so I want to thank you all for your participation. I'm looking forward to starting our second semester, uh, where we're going to have a shift in our focus now on appellate advocacy, um. I think as you, most of you know already from my background is that uh I've been an appellate attorney for um actually 30 years now. I recently celebrated my 30th anniversary at the Manhattan DA's office in the Appeals division and uh so I love, I love appellate research and writing. I think it's fun, it's exciting. I think you literally learn something new every time, substantively writing style, editing, um, and so I, I'm really looking forward to, uh, embarking on this journey with all of you. Um, a couple of things, uh, I guess I just wanted to first, if, if our, uh, we have two wonderful teaching fellows, uh, student editors who will be who are in our class this semester. Uh, I think they're gonna introduce themselves a little bit more, but I just wanted to, Jacob, if you could just introduce yourself.

SPEAKER 1
Hello everyone, my name is Jacob. I'm a 30 here. Um, I'm one of the TAs. I, I guess a little bit about myself. I'm from New Jersey. I really like appellate litigation. I'm actually dealing with like 3 appeals this semester alone because um there's this appeal in LPW and then I'm also a TA for the appellate litigation clinic. Um, that a lot of like the 20s and 30s are in, and then I'm also the director for the Fred Doug like specialized MOC court competition if you guys have friends that may be doing that, I'm the person that's running that competition, so I have like a lot of appeals going on, but yeah, so that's me.

SPEAKER 0
Thanks, Jacob Clemens.

SPEAKER 2
Clements, um, I'm a 2L student. I'm also a TA for another class in my case, criminal law. Um, we did LPW. Um, ourselves last year and I thought it could be a good experience.

SPEAKER 0
Right. Thank you both and uh Clemens and Jacob will talk a little bit more about our, our problem set. Um, first of all, I just wanted to make sure too, uh, did all of you receive the, the, the record on appeal, uh, uh, Ribbons versus Echoraft as well as, uh, the MOport Handbook? Um, I'd asked if, you know, if you had the time to be able to at least review the stuff, uh, review, review both the handbook and the, uh, the record on appeal to just get a little bit of a sense of like the, the problem set that you'll be dealing with, uh, this semester. I think it's a very, very interesting, it's gonna present some very interesting issues. Um, one of the things too, I wanted to ask all of you is, is that, um, How also just a little bit of a uh uh the structure of sort of how the, the semester will go as far as the, the brief writing. Um, one of the first things that we're going to do is that we are going to assign pairs uh because there's a, obviously the appellant is uh Mr. Rivens and then the uh appelle, appellate appelle is Echo Craft. Um, there'll be, uh Appellants brief and an appellate brief, um, but you will be writing these briefs and arguing them in, in pairs, so it will be, uh, and, uh, as you, as the way you do it in pairs too will be that someone will be handling issue one. And someone will be handling issue too, and then together as a team, you will write together like the remainder of the brief. We'll get into more details and the breakdown of the particulars as the semester goes along, but that's sort of the, the, the breakdown basically. But in order for us to do pairs, and we're hoping, um, Jacob and Clements and I, uh, we will hopefully be making a, a decision on the. Pairings, uh, by tomorrow so you'll, you'll know by tomorrow who your partner is. I don't want you to read really anything into the pairings. Um, I, I just, we, we did, uh, I submit a, we did send out a survey that we asked all of you to please fill out to kind of help aid, you know, give pro provide some assistance to us and maybe trying to find, uh, Uh, you know, maybe, uh, uh, the best sort of pairing, so to say, but again, it's not gonna be any mathematical formula and there's nothing, I don't want you to read anything into it. We, we're just hoping to use it as an aid, um, and I'd like to begin, uh, to, to set the pairings early so that you can work together with your partner as soon as possible, um, and so. You should be able to find out at some point tomorrow, we anticipate, um, so just check your email and uh you'll see who your partner is. Um, another thing too I wanted to uh uh let you know, you may have already gotten emails about this and I also indicated it on the syllabus, but there will be a, a research, uh, a refresher research class, um. I think some of them are being held tomorrow, Friday, and some are being held Monday for our class, um, your assigned research class is, um, as I indicated on the syllabus, uh, it's on Monday, I believe it's from 3:20 to 4:10. Uh, you'll see the room number in Jerome Green. Yes, Sydney, yes, if we have a conflict. Good question. If you have a conflict that you can't go to that one, yes, if you, um, there is, um, Jacob and Clemens, there was the sheet. I'm not sure whether all of you have seen it. There are other classes that are being offered, uh, for the refresher course. So if you're not able to attend the one on Monday, the one that you're set for 3:20, 4:10, whichever room it was with Josh Freeman, um, you can attend another one, but it would. It would have to be for the same one with the same problem set, so the, yeah, that the makeup

SPEAKER 1
for that one, I think it's Friday 1:20 to 2:10. Is next Friday? 1:23 tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow.

SPEAKER 0
Are there actually, is it, I thought with the color coding, was it based on that? Are there any other ones on Monday?

SPEAKER 1
Um, on Monday. No, all the ones on Monday are at 3:20. All the ones on Friday are at 1:20.

SPEAKER 0
Oh, you know, you're right, I do see that, that's right. So the other, other offering for this, with this problem set would then be on tomorrow, Friday the 23rd. Uh, are you looking at the one that says, uh, from 120 to 210? Yes. And JGH 105, yeah, it's in the same room, 1103.

SPEAKER 1
Got it.

SPEAKER 0
Oh, maybe 105, though, right? Are you looking at that one?

SPEAKER 1
Um, No, the one I'm looking at says 103. 0, OK then. Because 105 is the first newcle problem, then we're doing the fifth one, OK, you know, I must be looking

SPEAKER 0
at a little bit. Do you mind if I look over your shoulder? That's that.

SPEAKER 1
So this is us. We're doing the fifth problem. All of these are the fifth problem. Got you.

SPEAKER 0
Got you. I must be looking also at an older one where they originally had it at one.

SPEAKER 2
So yeah, so you have 320 on Monday and you

SPEAKER 1
also have 120 on Friday.

SPEAKER 0
Got it.

SPEAKER 1
OK, because then we're going up against which of the. Uh, we're Victor. Yeah, so, yeah, I think that that would make sense for you. That would make sense, right.

SPEAKER 0
OK. So it would be Friday tomorrow at 1:20 to 2:10 in JGH, uh, 103 in the event you can't do the Monday one. I would really highly stress that you should go to it because I think it'll be helpful to do a pressure research course and it's also, I think, geared in particular for this sort of problem set. So I think it'll be good to get off to a running start as to that. So, um. Again, I would, uh, really, uh, stress that you should, you should attend the, the research session. I also, I'm, I'm sorry, I'd like to introduce a new student in our, in our section. Um, do you want to just briefly introduce yourself? Yeah, um, should I say anything? Yeah, I'll, I'll go show your name and then just go, just a little, yeah, a little while. Um, I'm Ramon. I think we're all in love with, OK, um, so we know each other, but I grew up in Colorado. I was born in the Netherlands, um, my family is Libyan. Yeah, great, thank you, thanks, thank you, Ram. uh, Riam coming to our class helped to also even out numbers, uh, I mean, that's not the only reason why we're happy to have her here. Professor Older's class had, uh, 9, I believe, right? So now he's, uh, 8, which makes for, for 4 teams, and we are now 12, which makes for 6 teams. So, you know, this is what like faculty, what we talked about, right? And I'm saying it's like what numbers do you have, you know, so, um, but thank you, thank you for joining us.

SPEAKER 1
Uh, can, can everyone else actually introduce themselves?

SPEAKER 0
Sure. Oh, of course, I'm so sorry. Yes, absolutely. If, if you wouldn't mind just so that, uh, Jacob and, and Clemens can get to know our class, our community. Hi, thank you, I'm Ea.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Do you want to, shall we do just also like the way we did the LPW one, I think. Did we do it just a little bit more of a bio maybe if you would, if you feel comfortable sharing just a little bit.

SPEAKER 2
Sure, I'm Una. I'm from Seattle, Washington, originally, um, I What else is relevant about me? What do you want to do after lesson? Oh, probably something like direct services having to do with

SPEAKER 0
like incarceration, your rights stuff, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Uh, I'm Max. I'm from the Washington DC area, uh, and like Una,

SPEAKER 1
probably direct services either defense or, uh, civil litigation or

SPEAKER 2
so. OK, uh, I'm from Sydney.

SPEAKER 0
I'm originally from Nashville, Tennessee, um, and I want to do like corporate law.

SPEAKER 2
Were you in my, uh, introduction with legal methods? It was it? No, it was Pittsburg.

SPEAKER 0
Oh, for this semester, um, I don't think so.

SPEAKER 2
I think. Oh, McKinney, yeah, it's the second one. Uh, 00, sorry, I'm sorry, my name is Amira. I am from Turkey. My family. And I don't do human rights to that. I think mostly about like the multiple prison. I'm Ashley, I'm from New York City and I'm going to work uh in a transactional group after I graduate. Uh, I'm Jeff.

SPEAKER 1
I'm from New Jersey, and uh I also want to work at a law firm after I graduate of New Jersey in Bergen, Jersey, do you have?

SPEAKER 0
Do you know if you don't know, that's fine.

SPEAKER 1
I'm, I'm pretty versed. Is the term I, I, I'm interested in like corporate tax or litigation, I guess.

SPEAKER 2
My name is Moshe. I'm from Brooklyn, and I studied computer science before law school and after school, I want to do transactional work.

SPEAKER 0
Great, wonderful. Thank you, everybody. I appreciate that. Um, so I will, would ask you if, if you have not already filled out the, uh, the teen parent survey, if I could, uh, kindly ask if you could please do so, uh, maybe right after class, uh, it shouldn't take very long, uh, and it would be again very helpful for us. So if you could help us, help us in that regard, and like I said, expect by tomorrow, by tomorrow you'll get an email about who your partner is, so. Um, again, we're a community and I think that, I think one of the nice things too about pairings is that it's a nice way, I don't think we did this right in LPW one, for you to really work on an assignment together on a brief, so I think it'll, and then it'll just every step along the way between the writing and then preparing for oral arguments, I think it'll be a really good experience for you and something that's really reflective of real life, you know, as far as for how it goes. I'll give you an example for me. We, we very rarely write any brief in my bureau, uh, sole singly. I mean, there may be a main writer, but there's always an editor, uh, and you, so you always work in teams in some way, and I think for me I feel like it's been very helpful for me because I also find that just writing, uh, I like to self-edit but. But I also do think that when you work with someone and you do sort of what will be a version of pair editing here or working with your teammate and, and producing a final draft of something where you think it's, you know, your personal best and, and the best product that you're going to submit to court, I think that it's also a good skill set to learn along the way. Um, if I may also, I just wanted to kind of briefly go over, uh, the, the syllabus if, um, did you, everybody did receive the syllabus. Uh, I'm not gonna read it to you, but I just wanted to kind of highlight a couple of things, uh, about it. Um, And that would be a. First of all, it would be that uh I noted on page one, there's a couple of of key deadlines that I would like everyone to be aware of. Uh, and that would be that with the first draft for the, for the brief will be uh February 16th, that's gonna be on a Monday. Um, the second draft is going to be February 27th, which is a Friday. And then the final draft will be March 24th, a Tuesday, and I just want to stress this, um, is that there's, there's not gonna be any extensions permitted. I mean, I'm not gonna even be able to give an extent, uh, uh, grant an extension. The only person who could would be the program director, and that would have to be, as I understand. Extenuating circumstances. Um, so I would just ask you to keep, please keep this in mind as you prepare your, the, the brief and then the final version of the brief, uh, is that, um, please keep in mind March 24th that it is, that's, that's the deadline. You know, I think we've talked about this in LPW one is, is that, um, you know, in, in, in a school setting sometimes, some professors are very, very also strict with deadlines, right? I think, have you seen some of your professors? Are they, are they like, this is the deadline and if you don't get it in by then, uh, I don't think you're going to fail, right? But they, do they, do you get penalized? Um, does it depend on the class?

SPEAKER 1
I mean, I feel like this is always like most of my class has just been like exams.

SPEAKER 0
OK, got you.

SPEAKER 1
I mean, so yes, you can't move back in exam,

SPEAKER 0
exactly, I guess so. With writing assignments, I mean, like real life, OK, and I think you, you, you've heard me say this before in LPW one, You know, there are different types of deadlines, right? Sometimes I will have, uh, uh, uh, I, I, I edit a lot now, but I'll have, I have an edit might say to me, you know, Grace, I know I told you I'd get you the draft tomorrow, Friday, but I just, I just couldn't get it done. Uh, can I have till Monday, Tuesday? Now, you know, that's an internal deadline, you know, and I You, you work things out depending on when, when is it due in court. Um, you work things out, and, but then there's also like, for example, right now my, my bureau, we're working towards the March term filing deadline which is February 4th, the Wednesday. I mean, that is a deadline that if our brief is due then, it's due then. I mean, I can't get an extension of time. Not really, but there's a possibility if, let's say on February 3rd, and I really know we cannot file this, you know, I might call my adversary, opposing counsel and ask whether they'll agree to a stipulation, you know, agree to adjourn the, uh, the case for one term, uh, or ask for a one week extension, or I have to make an emergency application to the court. So, I mean, deadlines really do exist. So in the world of appellate law like here, this would be a brief that's due in the Second Circuit. I mean, their deadlines are pretty strict. So, um, want to kind of keep you thinking along those lines as far as why we have deadlines and why sometimes extensions are not permitted. So, um, so, uh, those are the key deadlines. Um, attendance, I am going to ask if you could please, everybody, try to, try to come to. All your classes, you know, all the classes. If you're not able to, please just, you know, send me a note, send me a note if you know beforehand, just and, and a brief reason why, OK? And I understand sometimes things happen between, you're not feeling well and other personal circumstances. I understand that can happen. What we have been asked to tell students though is that to please not miss class because of things like interviews, uh, and career sort of uh job-related matters to try to avoid doing that. Um, I, my understanding is that there's a lot of discussion about that, so I'm just, I just wanted to report that to try to minimize, uh, not skipping class because of job-related matters. So I'll just, I'll leave it at that, OK? Um. And I think for now that's really mainly just to walk you through. We, we front load a lot in the class this, in the semester uh between the draft deadlines uh and, and the final draft of the briefing in on March 24th because then we're gonna shift after that to preparing for oral arguments which I think is gonna be fun. I mean, It, it can be nerve-wracking too. I don't know how the both of you have founded Clemens and, uh, and Jacob, oral arguments, doing it for the first time. Exciting, not exciting, scary, this, uh, yeah, the first time

SPEAKER 1
is definitely, I was definitely nervous, but I think the more time, like the more you practice, eventually it gets to a point where it's like fun for me at

SPEAKER 2
least. I remember being so overwhelmed with activities during one hour that I couldn't really prepare as much as I would have liked to, and I thought that went fine as well, so I, I wouldn't freak out.

SPEAKER 0
Everyone's gonna have a different experience and every, every experience is gonna be fine, and I just want to promise you, you're gonna get through this, and I want you to try to also look at it, really the fun side of it. I think it's, I feel that I still get nervous when I argue. I always feel like it's that 1st 30 to 60 seconds when I'm at the podium. And I'm beginning my argument that I have a little bit of that butterflies in my stomach, but I also find that once I get in sort of the groove, uh, I'm fine, and um I just think that it's, it's really a, a lovely way to compliment your appellate brief writing, you know, there you are in front of a panel of judges, you know, defending. You, you know, basically your case and your position and trying to convince the judges that they should rule in your favor, and I think that's just, it's just, it's a lot of fun. I think it's a lot of fun. Uh, I also like when there's a hot bench, so to say, the expression hot bench, when judges ask a lot of questions, um, because it's nice, it's a nice engagement, and, you know, as far as you, I would like them to ask questions too because you hope that that means that they're, they're interested in the case. They actually read the briefs, you know, that they actually. You know what the issues are and that they, you know, and to the extent that they may be struggling with any of the issues about where they're going to land on it as far as how they're going to rule, that, you know, hopefully you're going to be there as an advocate to be able to say why the answer should be this. Um, so we'll be later in the semester, we'll be working a lot on preparing for oral arguments. So I think that I really hope it'll be very beneficial and hopefully a really fun experience for all of you. Um, another thing I will point out is, is that, um, Uh, the week of April 13th, um, in fact, I think it is, it is on April 13th, um, the Harland Stone MO court, uh, final arguments are going to be held, uh, at 4 p.m., and my understanding is that attendance is required for, uh, for all 1L students, and I think you should, you would want to go anyway. I think it's, it's wonderful. I had the opportunity to judge the preliminary rounds, and it was great, wonderful fact pattern, and I was really, really impressed by the By the briefs and the arguments, um, and it'd be a wonderful way to, for you to see oral arguments, you know, before you do your own oral arguments in, in this case. So, uh, again, expect that, set aside that date April 13th, uh, and then April 14th to 16th will be, uh, your oral arguments, and we anticipate that we'll be able to get judges like, uh, alumni, I guess, student judges. Do you remember? who, who, well, I know you did specialize moot court, but Clemens, did you, with, with your, with the judges for your moot court, did you remember, were they, were they alumni, real life judges, uh, attorneys?

SPEAKER 2
I believe it was mixed. So I think a couple of people were retired judges from the state court system, and then one person was a law firm. Senior associate, got you, got you, right. So I think that they're trying to combine a mixture of people and everybody has their own style.

SPEAKER 0
Do you know for the finals for the Stone, um, the Stoneman court, do they bring in real judges from outside, or do they, again, it can be a little bit of a mix?

SPEAKER 1
I, I don't know, but I assume that they do try to bring in real judges because, um. Just for like our competitions in general that's usually how it is for the one I'm organizing that's what we're doing, yeah, got it.

SPEAKER 0
OK, great. So again, I think we're gonna have a very, very, I think, uh. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a lot of, a lot of stuff will be going on, and, and I also anticipate the structure of LPW2 is is that there'll be more in-class, uh, time exercises working with, with, um, uh, with Jacob and Clemens and myself, uh, on, on the issues in the case as you prepare the briefs and stuff. So, I'm hoping that it will also be very beneficial for all, uh, uh, in that regard. Um. Let's see. I think I wanted to also just use the opportunity to real briefly is with the MOOC court handbook. Um, I think it's gonna be very, very helpful resource for you, so again, I would stress if you could read through it. I know for our assignments for next week, um, uh, it does say. To read pages 1 to 7, um, read even beyond that, please, you know, I think though it, it'll give you a good idea of what you will be doing in, in preparing and, and writing the briefs in, in, in, uh, Rivens versus, uh, Echo Craft, um, and in addition, there'll be the Newman reading assignments, um, and then another thing too is, is that, um, As you go through the record on appeal, um, there will also, one of your assignments that will also, it's gonna be due on, um, I'm, I'm asking that to be due on January twenty-eighth, which would be the day before our class is, um, drafting a description of the case and you will see that in the handbook, um, the assignment is described how to do a description of the case and in particular, you can find it on page, um, Page 66 to 7 of the handbook, um, gives you an idea about what, what we want you to write for the description of the case assignment, and that will help in facilitating our next class, uh, in going through that. Um, so, do, please do prepare the description of the case and uh please submit that on, um. On, uh, the day before our next class on January twenty-eighth, and I believe then we'll talk about this, but I guess Clemens and, and, uh, Jacob, I guess we'll do submissions. I know last year sometimes we did submissions you email, but I think maybe we'll do submissions through courseworks like through a portal, and we'll have a portal set up for that. OK. I'm gonna utilize that more this semester as opposed to like emailing to myself or to Clemens and Jacob, um. And um, unless you have any other suggestions otherwise in that regard, I think that's good. OK, great. And then, um, I think for now then I just with, with Jacob Clements, would you want to just give a little bit of a, an overview of the, of the problem set and maybe the particular issues? I'm just going to let you, let you guys take over for that in that regard and maybe doing a

SPEAKER 2
brief discussion. OK, there are two issues. They are mixed, um, this whole record, I would say is designed to confuse you, um, uh, there are little hints sprinkled all over, but it's purposefully messy, so it's helpful to be able to filter out what's important, what is maybe more of a distraction. This whole thing is very long, so maybe it's helpful to just skim it just to get things started. I Can I give hints, or should I just, uh,

SPEAKER 0
sure, absolutely, that's fine, totally.

SPEAKER 2
So my hand is to look out for clear cut tests. Specifically when they're saying for example hey this is about summary judgment it's helpful to figure out what exactly summary judgment is or what exactly the standard is that they're trying to apply similarly when they're spelling out tests for substantive law, for example, what is retaliation, it's helpful to just keep track of that and be very clear about what the individual factors are and then I think in my own. In my own moot court we had Fair Labor Standards Act and then a lot of it came down to just discussing with the other team whether individual factors from the test were met. So my, my, my suggestions are. Um, first of all, getting a clear grasp of the legal standard and then also taking clear note whenever there's applicable or whenever there's a test or something like that with many factors.

SPEAKER 1
Uh, do you want us to talk about the fax at all or no?

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, sure, that'll be great too, actually, if you don't, yeah, yeah, if that's OK. Are you, are you OK with doing that? Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so, first issue is about retaliation. Um, it's about a plaintiff who was in a music. In a music company and then he finds out that bonus payments are different and then the question is why exactly are these bonus payments different? Is it because people are just working in different departments? Is there perhaps some sort of discrimination going on and the line is kind of blurry and you could argue for both sides, so. Yeah, it's, it's going to be a close case, I would say.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, so the, the second issue is about copyright, and it's, it's like one, it's one fact pattern, but both issues are like within that one fact pattern, and the way the fact pattern is set up is that it appears as though it's like, OK, here's the issue one information, here's the issue 2 information, and for the, it kind of like it's kind of like that, but at the same time, like you will definitely find relevant information about like issue number 2 and something that looks like it's for issue number 1. Or issue number or vice versa, like any deposition, it might be like switching gears, let's talk about like the song now and you might still get information about retaliation, but um, so that's like one suggestion I have, but just more substantively what it's about is someone. Like the same person obviously that is like investigating like whether or not like them being fired as retaliation or not, they wrote a song and they were like negotiating like with the with the school and then in the middle of the negotiations like the school stopped negotiating with them and then uh they went with like the company that fired him, so and then the company that fired him, like the question is whether or not like the song that they offered is like. A copyright infringement on the original song that he had, and the song is about like um. Like a historical figure, Paul Revere, which makes things very interesting. There's a lot of different things you can argue because like the copyright, when you, when you go into everything hinges on like this one statute that has like a four-p test and when you go into that, there's like a lot of different questions about. Well, copyright law depends. There's a lot that depends on like what exactly like the use is for, like if it's educational, if it's not educational, if it's creative, if it's not, and the fact that it's like kind of historical song like kind of makes things like very tricky and there's a lot of different angles you can play around with with that, but um. Yeah, that's pretty much it. I, I would say for now.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, great. I, you know, I thought I read through the fact pattern here or the record on appeal, and uh I do think it's gonna present a really, really, uh, Interesting problem set and I do think, I feel, I, in my opinion right now, just preliminarily at least, I haven't really dove into it as, as much, but I do think it's, I think it's close on both issues, so which is why it presents, I think a really good fact pattern set. Um, a couple of things though too also, and again I understand that you may not have really, uh, gone through the record on appeal and digested it in detail, um, you know, you just got it, but, um, I did want to walk you through a couple of things on it, you know, as I was tapping things along the way. Um, you know, in, in any kind of when you handle an appeal, um, You're, you're going to be, uh, the record on appeal is, is really kind of like the, the resource, the materials that you're going to be bound to use it. You can't really use anything outside whatever is on the record on appeal. Sometimes there are issues raised on appeal like a litigant will, will, will, will cite. Certain facts, uh, uh, about a case or may uh allege certain sort of evidence or facts and sometimes the opposing counsel or even a judge might sort of say, well, where is that in the record? Is that part of the record on appeal? You know, really, what you're bound by is, is really what is presented in the record. Um, here, like, for example, like, uh, when we, when we oftentimes like in my office, we are about 90% of the time we're the respondent. Um, so we, we're not the appellant, we're not the, I know how to pronounce it, appelle, appelle, appelle, but we're like basically the respondents most of the time what it's called in, at least in criminal, in criminal cases, but I also do handle civil appeals, uh, mostly in the state court system. But, um, it, you know, literally we do get like a judgment role, a record on appeal, and then a lot of it will also be the minutes. Here I noticed that in the record that you're being presented. With here the minutes are uh deposition minutes um for some of the, the witnesses in the case. So, um, just read through the record very carefully, you know, the, there will be clues, hints, uh, and what I mean by is like you, you also have to understand what you're looking for. So, but be very, very, I, I would just stress read the record very carefully. Head to toe, and I would also suggest even before you begin like digesting the, the record on appeal, I would suggest that you actually do read through without any taking any kind of notations initially. I, I would recommend just sort of reading it head to toe and just to get a feel for sort of the lay of the land of what are the records, what are the records that are presented in the record of appeal, so you get a little bit of a sense of like. You know, what you'll need to be looking for and there's different materials here. I know that sometimes with me, I, this is, again, everyone works differently, but Here, I often, you'll see that the decision, that the district court judge's decision is at the end of the, of the record on appeal. I often start with just the decision just to get a sense of what was the decision and what, what was the judge's reasoning. Um, that might also be, that sort of is a nice, I think, uh, uh, uh, uh. A good way to embark on sort of what the issues are going to be and also because ultimately, whether you're the appellant or the appellee. Um, you're either going to be saying that the judge was right or the judge was wrong, right? And so seeing where the judge's reasoning was, what cases the judge cite to? Was the judge right? Was the judge, and how did the judge reason and what the judge give really a reason? Um, that would be a good jumping stone, I think, for you to be able to kind of get a sense of maybe what are the relevant cases out there, but don't also think that that's going to be the, the, the cases that the judge cites are going to be. Only relevant cases out there, um, but it's definitely, of course, a good, a good point and a starting point and sort of where you're going to be taking sort of the, the issues and, and what you're gonna be looking at. Um, keep in mind too as you review the record on appeal and as you're preparing your brief and the issues is things like what is the standard of review. You need to understand what that is in your case as you're gonna be presenting this case to the US Court of Appeals. The Second Circuit, what is the standard of review, and that's in, in every case is really like, what is this court? What is, how is the, what is the standard of review for how they're supposed to review, uh, each of the issues in this case. Example, is it de novo? Is it abuse of discretion, uh, is it something else? Um, so keep, be mindful of that as you're doing your research and, and, uh, and presenting your case, um. Another thing too, but you've seen this also, right, in the, in the memos that you wrote, your open memo, the, the open memo and the closed memo, um, is that, you know, you're going to gather, of course, the cases that are going to support your arguments in your position, uh, your client's position, but of course, you're gonna also have to be aware of, right, what the, uh, uh, adverse or the decisions out there, case law out there that might not be favorable for you that you're gonna have to distinguish. The only thing that I noticed that's a little bit different about how we're doing a MO court fact pattern as it, as opposed to like quote unquote real life is that uh You're writing it, uh, as in a, normally it's the appellant submits their brief first, right? And then the appelle, the respondent gets to then respond to that. Uh, if you're gonna be assigned the role of the respondent to the appelle here, You're, you're writing it in a way, in a way that you're not really answering someone else's brief, right? The appellant's brief because it hasn't, you're not answering that, you're, you're, everyone's submitting it at the same time. So, as an appelle, as an appellant, uh, uh, as a respondent appelle, you're gonna build into it though. Right. Arguments that already knowing what are gonna be arguments that are adverse to your position and trying to distinguish that. So you're still gonna work that in the way you did in your, in your legal memos, but the difference now is that you're advocates, right? You're, you're here to take a stating position and, uh, depending on your appellant or or the, or the appelle, um, you're representing, you're, you're, you're engaging in now persuasive, uh, writing here. Um, but it still has to be honest, right? In the sense that it has to be incorporated that there's, there's gonna be cases out there that are not gonna, they're gonna be adverse to your position. You have to deal with it and address it. I think another thing to advice that I would give you as you work your way through this is that, um, you know, how many arguments you have to make and the order in which you make them, um, that's also something to think about, something that you might wanna work out with your partner. You don't have to necessarily make every argument under the sun that you could possibly make in support of your position. Um, sometimes it's the advice is that you give, you make strong arguments, you make your strongest arguments, and that sort of the less, not, not a strong arguments that you may not even need to make because it might almost in a way water down your main arguments. There are some writers who like to say that I'm, I'm writing, I'm, I'm, I'm arguing everything. I mean, I'll, I'll argue maybe the, the, the strongest arguments first, but I'm arguing everything. I included the lesser arguments last or even footnotes, um, but think about that, whether you think that you need to do that in, in, in addressing when you, when you brief your issue, um, so those are sort of the things that I wanted to sort of keep in, I wanted you to keep in mind as you between digesting the record on appeal and as you prepare, you know, your issues, uh, uh, in your, in your brief. I don't know, Jacob and Clemens, did you have any thoughts on any, on any of that?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I was just gonna say one thing like in regards to like how to like start off, um, one thing that I think I wish I did was, and also actually before I even say this, like you're gonna, you're gonna probably hear like a lot of different like approaches and like it's important to like go like own your argument and go with like what feels right for you because like um. There's like a whole bunch of different approaches to grief writing, and I think that like one of my favorite parts of it is getting creative with your argument and like, like finding like niche cases and making like creative arguments and stuff like that, so um. Yeah, so like there's no one right way to do it, but with that being said, one thing that I think I would have benefited from is reading like the rule first before I go through the problem, because then when I'm going through the fact pattern, my first time going through it, I was seeing like a lot of very particular facts, and I was like, it's like a very particular thing you'd mention like this has to be like relevant to the rule somehow, but I will find out when I get to the bottom and when I read the rule and I could have just read the rule in the first place and then with the rule in mind going through the problem. It would have been a lot easier to synthesize all these facts that I'm reading and like understand like why I'm being told certain things and know what to look out for. So, uh, the, yeah, like the relevant rules are probably somewhere at the bottom or like however you want to figure that out, I think I would suggest reading that first before reading the whole thing from from.

SPEAKER 0
Good points, comments, any, any thoughts?

SPEAKER 2
I would suggest I always try to make my own writing simple. My feeling was that the cases can be messy. There can be a lot of details, and I figured that one thing that helped me is to make my points as simple as I possibly could, both on the content level, but also then in terms of legal writing, so making direct, straightforward sentences, not being redundant, um, getting to the point, just being clear and precise and short, I think.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, I think that's, that's also really good advice. I have to say even with me over the years in self-editing, I think being a little uh when I started out, uh I was often told by editors like. Too much, you know, I wasn't concise enough, um, and I, I do feel that I've been able to, uh, be a little more concise, a little bit, uh, uh. And that's not to just say, by the way, I don't want to make it look like as if like just if you, you know. I don't wanna be like sometimes I mean there are like page restrictions and more restrictions on a lot of briefs, um, in, in real life and, and here also I don't actually think we have a page restriction here, right, but we do, there's a suggestion for the points. Um, I'm not sure. Yeah, I do believe I realized I should get back to you on that. I do think that there was a suggestion, but I don't think there's a precise like page limit. But I think that there was a suggestion for how much, how many pages were considered for each. I think it was somewhere in around 10 to 15 pages, I think, for each issue at most along those lines. We'll get back to you on that, but, um, but I think in agreement with what Clemens said is that, you know, if you can make your point and keep it simple and more concise, that, that would, that's probably more effective. And I think generally for judges because you remember they're gonna read through a brief and if you could say something in maybe 2, paragraph or two versus, you know, 2 or 3 pages, uh, it probably generally, generally it is better to be a little bit more concise, um, but of course it has that content, right? You need to support what you have to say, hopefully the case law, statutes and stuff like that, but I, I agree with you on that. If I may also, um, and I saw this a little bit on the, when I was looking at the, uh, um, by the way, you know, on the, the, the handbook, the MOOC court handbook, there is a sample brief in there that will give you a nice sort of a structure, a little bit of the layout of, of what your brief will also look like. Everything from, you know, the statement of the case, questions presented, and the issues and stuff like that, um. I think that like I, I'd like to see a statement of facts, I guess this is what we call it in our briefs here, I guess it's really the background, I guess the, of the case. In my opinion, it has to be fair. It has to be comprehensive. It can't be just the facts that are favorable to your client. I think you do have to state what the facts are in the case, but I do think that you can also say it in a way where, again, you have to, and you cite to the record, um, but you can also say it in a way that might be, um, in a way that's also presented, that can be, um, Worded and, and also including also all facts that will be helpful to your client. You wanna do that. I, I like to see a statement of facts, a statement of the case, or statement of facts, the evidence of the in the case that a little more robust. I'd like to see a little more than a little less. That's just me, uh, and especially when there are things there that are helpful for your client. Uh, I, I also think it's really important and I think there were comments about this I made sometimes on the legal memos is that. Make sure that if you're, if you're referring to certain facts in the record, uh, evidence in the record. Uh, in an argument, make sure that it, it was in your statement of facts. Like you don't want it to appear for the first time in, in your argument, so just make sure that it was already in the statement of facts. You want it all read there so that the reader understands what happens and then later on when they're reading your argument, your issue, your point, um, they'll, they'll understand that it was already in the statement of fact. So it's gotta be there first. It can't make its first appearance in, in your, in your, in your point, in your issue. I hope that makes sense. Um, Yeah, and just to walk you through this again, I'm not sure whether or not you've had a chance to look through the, uh, the record on appeal, but, um, you know, what you'll see the documents that they, that are included here are, um, there are stipulations. Do read the stipulations near the beginning on page two. Um, because it just, it gives you an idea of what you're not supposed to be looking at beyond the record on this case. So do look at the stipulations. Um, there's a statement of statements of jurisdiction in the venue, and then on page 4, there are the key statutory provisions at issue here for issue 1 and issue 2, very important to, to look at. Then you'll find on page 5 is the complaint. And on page 10 is the answer to the complaint. And then, uh, from pages 12 on for uh bulk of it, you'll see there will be minutes for depositions of, of, uh, various persons including Philip Riven. I'm not sure. Am I pronouncing his name correctly? Ribbon, Riven, Ron, Ribbon. OK, I'll, I'll pronounce his name Ribbon. Um, Daphne Sniff. Uh, there's also for Jacqueline Moses. And for Ryan Rain. And uh Ellie Tobin. So we have those uh witnesses' depositions. Again, read through their minutes, very, their deposition minutes very carefully and see how you're going to incorporate that in your statement of facts and in your arguments. Again, you're gonna find everything you need in these, in the, in the minutes, in the record here. And then there are several exhibits that were referred to in the um During the deposition, so various exhibits, uh, that are near the end of the uh of the uh the record on appeal. Um, but then after that, there is then also the, starting on page 103, the defendant's the motion for summary judgment. And followed by on page 105, the plaintiff's affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. And then finally, the judge's decision on page 107, the decision and order from the judge in the Southern District of New York. And again, I would stress, read the, if you haven't already read this, I would say, I would suggest maybe read the, read the decision first, go to the end, and then before you then digest the rest of the record. Um. Great, I think that's all I really have to say for now. Does anyone have any questions?

SPEAKER 2
No. Any thoughts?

SPEAKER 0
Any other? I do have a question. Sure, Una, yes, we're writing the briefs in pairs. You are writing the briefs in Paris, correct? Does that include this is maybe a stupid clarifying question. No, no, no, it's not gonna be silly.

SPEAKER 2
I outlines and like all the lead up assignments too or not. I mean, I would assume drafts like outline and like uh.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, you will, your drafts will be like your um. So for example, each of you will do your the description of the case that's due on, on Wednesday, right? You'll do that separately. You'll do that individually, OK? Your, uh, uh, there's an outline, I believe that's also going to be due. There's a due date on that. Uh, you'll be doing your outline individually. It should be, I believe, yes. And then your first draft and second draft, um. I, I do believe it should be individually, right?

SPEAKER 2
No. I think we did it individually, but then we merged our final, merged the final one, right?

SPEAKER 0
I think that's, is that how it would work? Good question, Una, really, when I'm thinking about this because of the pairs, right, because you'll see from the syllabus to the outline is, is that they're, um. Depending on, like, for example, let me, uh, actually, let's just look through this together actually. No, that's an excellent question because of the pair because ultimately your, let me just put it this way, your final draft with your partner, um, there's gonna be such like you, you will each write your own issue, although I would also suggest that like. This doesn't mean that, uh, I, I would say that it doesn't mean that you totally don't have to know anything about the other issue. I think that it would be very important for you holistically to understand what the other issue is about. You may, you may not be writing it, but you have to be familiar with it because I want you to also keep this in mind. It. Issues in the brief, sometimes there are, there's crossovers, you know, as far as what's being presented and maybe some of the questions or some of the facts and some involved. So you want to make sure that they, you harmonize, I guess the best way to put it, your issue one and issue two. So you, you really. You should be familiar with your partner's issue. Um, you should read through your partner's issue, the final draft. You're going to be reading the whole brief head to toe and agreeing on what you're submitting here. While you will be primarily responsible for your issue, um, but you're gonna, there are other parts of the brief that you're going to be um. Writing together, so to say, the statement of facts, the summary, the, uh, summary of the arguments, the questions presented, um, and you'll, you'll, you'll work with your partner how you're going to do that, whether or not it's like how you divide that sort of labor, um, I mean, it'll be interesting to see, I guess with like Clemens and and also with with Jacob. I'm not sure how it does it depend on how you've worked on different briefs with partners. Um, so first I wanna say that it is, especially

SPEAKER 1
if you're a petitioner, it's very important as petitioner to know both sides of the argument because one of you guys is going to be designated to do the rebuttal with the oral argument and essentially what that is is like, um, the petitioner goes first and argues. And then for 28 minutes and then the respondent goes and argues for 30 minutes and then the petitioner goes up and then they use their last 2 minutes, but one person uses that 2 minutes to to like rebut like both issues and in that time they have like that person, whoever does need to do that obviously needs to know what to say for the other issue and they have to be prepared for follow-up questions. Additionally, the respondent, as respondent, you can also always just get questions about a different issue. Like the judge, a judge can do that if they want to, so for those two reasons it's very important to know both issues, um, yeah, that's actually a good

SPEAKER 0
point, absolutely. Um, did you find through your experiences, the both of you, as far as, let's say, um, uh, writing up the rest of the brief, like, uh, you know, the, the questions presented, the summary of the, the statement of the case, uh, the summary of the argument, did you find, would you have advice on how you have found how that works as far as when you work with a partner?

SPEAKER 1
Um. You can, I mean, at the end of the day, everything's gonna go on the same paper. Um, I'm trying to remember how I did it, I I feel like, I feel like for me like we were working like. We put everything on the same paper and like our submissions were like one because I remember I remember if like one person needed an extension then we both needed the extension that's the way that we did it um. And I think like the biggest thing is like literally like formatting, which sounds weird but like there's like like even like in real life like there's like very strict formatting requirements and when you're both working on the same Google Doc you both have to be careful about things like that. There's also the like the table content and like where like it references like when you're citing different cases like it has to say that we cited this case on this page and that's gonna change as you guys like work on things, um, so. Yeah, it's not really, it's not like entirely individual, like it's not like you're collaborating like a lot, but like I would suggest working at the same time so that like every 10 minutes, you might have a quick question and you might have to do a quick like joint effort to edit something, um. So yeah, it's just kind of like that.

SPEAKER 0
I hope that makes sense, yeah, yeah, I guess what I was also thinking about was along the lines of, let's say, for example, um, If you were to put together, let's say the statement of facts, like, is it that someone's going to write it up primarily and the other one will edit it, or will both of you do statement of facts together, like will you do an outline of what the statement of facts should be? Um, I, I, I do think that that's something that will be. I think that you and your partner will need to decide on that, um, and I think that that's kind of how it would be, you know, and, and that's real life, right? How you divide labor, you know, the division of labor in an assignment and stuff like that. So, um, I think that's something my advice, I think would be to work with your partner and how that's done. Maybe I'm just gonna, like a hypothetical, like for example, that it might be with your partner, one would say, you know what I'll do, I'll, I'll draft a statement of facts. We've talked about it, what we think we should include. Uh, and then how about you review it, you edit it, and then we kind of together work on the final, final version of it that we're going to submit that sort of thing, um, and same thing with maybe dividing between the summary of the arguments of questions presented, uh, that sort of thing. I think what's gonna be fun about this, and you're gonna see it is that it really works its way through, and I, 11 of the things I love about the teamwork on here is that you really, you do, you work with your partner about your final product. And I think you're going to see that final product on March 24th. It's something you should be really proud of, not just because of the issue that you're, you're going to, that you wrote and that you're going to defend in oral argument, but that the whole brief, the whole brief is a product of, of working together with, with a partner, and, um, I think that's great. It, it's, it's great skills that you're going to bring with you after you graduate and you're working at whatever law setting that you are firm. You know, government service, whatever it may be, you're gonna see that you're gonna be doing this day in and day out, really working, working in teams and stuff, so like this, and I, I just also like to believe that this is, we, we have a kind community here, so I'm very, very confident. That you will work very well with your, with your partner. I've seen how you work together in LPW1 and uh I think it's gonna, it's gonna be great. I just want to stress again, just please have fun. We are here as resources. We will, we'll work, we will guide you. We're gonna work on this together and guide you. I mean, you will be submitting the briefs, but we're here as, we're, we're here as a community and um. Jacob and Clemens, um, thank you. You know, we're gonna be here, so you'll see as the, as the, as the, as the, uh, semester goes on, there'll be a lot of more now in class where you'll be able to do work, working on your briefs, and then brainstorming, hair editing, and advising. By, uh, Clemens and Jacob and myself, um, as, as you walk through the brief. It'll, you'll see, I know that I don't want you to feel that it's too daunting about some of the timetables and some of the deadlines that are coming up, um, but I do think that we really wanna be able to keep you on track because, um, Again, keeping in mind the final draft March 24th, you know, which is, you know, about two months, right, um, it's, we just want to be able to make sure that you are on track, uh, for that deadline, and, and, and the main reason too also for that deadline too is, is that because, um, briefs have to be distributed to judges and, and stuff for them to be able to review and, and, and all. So, um, we're gonna have a great semester. So are there any other questions before, uh, we, we, we. Call it an end for this evening. OK. Thank you all. I appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of the evening and look forward to seeing you all next week. All right? Don't hesitate if you have any questions along the way, you can reach out to Clemens, Jacob, and myself, um, but I hope to see you all in class next week.

SPEAKER 2
Thank you.

SPEAKER 0
Take care. Thank you. Thank you, Jacob.

SPEAKER 2
I appreciate it. Thank you. We're actually excited. No, I don't.

SPEAKER 0
Oh, and, uh, just a quick reminder too, if, if you have not already filled out your survey, if you could please try to just do this, do it tonight so that it can help, uh, it'll be an aid for us. So thank you so much. Have a good night, everybody, OK? Thank you. Get home safely. Stay, stay warm too.

SPEAKER 2
So you go through the handbook handbook is 100 pages. Yeah, so I ripple through it, yeah, yeah. Yeah What I realized is holy shit yeah. That's why. I know my old friend came on the. That's that's the problem. I'm in charge of this spot, I found it is OK. I was like, I'm not gonna read that because you have to read this. Oh really, thank you guys. Nice to meet you.

SPEAKER 0
Good night. Take care, Max. Take care. You too. Oh be yourself for me. I think you know, I think that I find that with, uh, I know that when we interviewed, I just, uh, just, just be yourself, you know, maybe in, in expression and also in particular they're, they're probably gonna ask you why the LADA's office. And, and, you know, maybe traveling as much as you can with your interest in public interest, public service, government service, and kind of conveying that, that's awesome.
