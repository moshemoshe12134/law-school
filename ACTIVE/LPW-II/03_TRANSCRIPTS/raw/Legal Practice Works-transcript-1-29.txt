SPEAKER 0
You're on the good? Yeah, I do.

SPEAKER 1
to bump.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, yeah, that's. So we were crossing the street. I'm thinking, how did you, how did you get there? I took the bus. OK. Yeah. How about you? Did you skateboard? Yeah, I skied. It's funny we arrived at like kind of the same time. It's funny.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 0
I know it's funny.

SPEAKER 1
I was a little bit, uh, I just wanna make sure because I always take the bus.

SPEAKER 2
No, no, you do. I do.

SPEAKER 0
Did you get off at Lexington, uh, I mean we

SPEAKER 1
got off at Lexington. Usually I don't. I usually get off before I.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, oh yeah, Parks the best one, yeah, I overshot

SPEAKER 1
it, so that's why I was kind of like, oh really, yeah, and I actually, I was thinking I was gonna catch the train that's why.

SPEAKER 0
Do you know, OK, and then I realized right after

SPEAKER 1
I talked with you, I realized if this train is even I am, I am.

SPEAKER 3
Oh, I don't know who that is.

SPEAKER 2
I'm a little scared that the train's just rolling in, so it's right.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, I also wanted to ask you, I'm not sure if you got my e-mail about the. Yeah. Um, the internal complication. Yes, yes, yes.

SPEAKER 1
Is this weekend.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah. I'm, I'm so sorry.

SPEAKER 1
I appreciate if, if I could in the future this much insulin.

SPEAKER 0
I can. It's OK, yes please. It's actually it's OK, OK, I changed my mind. Thank you so much. It's amazing. OK.

SPEAKER 2
Oh sorry, I'm, I'm definitely not in this.

SPEAKER 0
What's that? How you doing? Oh, I'm looking for.

SPEAKER 1
I just feel like this, this thing is like in the way.

SPEAKER 0
And I Uh-huh. findings. I'm like oh God. Maybe I didn't. I put them in the first part but I. Oh no.

SPEAKER 1
Well, good evening, class. How's everyone doing? Good evening. How's everyone doing? OK? Great. OK. So, um, just a couple of things before I, I just give you a little overview of what I'm hoping that we're gonna be doing today. It's a breakdown of what our, our schedule will be for this evening. Um, is that, uh, well, the breakdown will be this, that, uh, I'm gonna just, uh, go over a couple of things, a couple of matters, and a couple of syllabus stuff, uh, class expectations and everything like that. Um, then what we're gonna do is that we will break down into two groups, uh, And what we'll do is, is that, uh, about I guess half the class will, will, uh, be in a group with Jacob. Half the class will be in a group with Clemens, uh, to talk about, uh, the issues in the, in the, uh, in the, uh, appeal here. So there's 11 issue is the retaliation issue. The other is the copyright infringement issue. Uh, Jacob, Jacob, you're gonna cover the copyright, correct? Clemens is retaliation, and then what we'll do is for about maybe 20 minutes or so, uh. The group with the, with the, the retaliation issue will discuss the issue and other aspects of brief writing. Uh, and then with the other issue will be the uh copyright infringement issue, same thing, going over the issue, uh, and, and, uh, sort of general brief writing overview of, of the, of the, uh, of the issues presented. Um, I hope that everyone has at this point, you, you, I would like you to have also available your description of the case, um, because we, that will be something that we can, uh, the, the groups can work off of. Um, then when you're done with that session, what we're gonna do is that you're gonna swap, you're gonna go to the other groups. So that we can talk about the other issue in the case. Uh, and so I hope that will be helpful to as sort of starters in sort of bringing your questions forward, bringing your thoughts sort of in a group session, your own individual questions, group questions that you have about the issues presented in the case. Um. I realized too that uh does everyone know we, we have pairings, right, for the briefs? Did everyone see who their partner is going to be? Uh, and I just also wanna make sure too that I have it correct here. Uh, we have, OK, so there's the appellant and the respondent, right? I just don't wanna say appelle or appelle, it's so awkward. So I'll just say the respondent. The appellant being Riven and the respondent being Echo Craft. For Riven, I believe we have a pairing of Una and Sydney. OK, and we have Max Niles and Scarlett. And uh we have Elmira and Ashley, yes, for our pellant ribbon and then for Respondent Echo Craft we have uh Riham. I'm so sorry, am I pronouncing Riham Riham, excuse me, Riham and uh Jeffrey, yes, OK, and we have Neilam and Moshe, yes, and then we have, uh, Max Liu and, uh, Jack. Yes, OK, great. Now the only thing I realized that I am, I'm sorry I did not make clear was that Uh, we, there's different ways we do this. We can, uh, some, I know some professors have sort of assigned issues. Um, sometimes some professors are just outright assigned pairings from, just from the get-go. I guess we did a form of that here. But, um, I didn't make clear last week, I realized that about the issues, who would write which issue in, in your pairing. Um, I've decided that I would like your, the pairings to decide who will write each each issue. If the parents, if there's not, you're not, uh, having difficulty in making that decision, or let's say both would like to write issue one or both would like to write on issue two, if there's any issues, no pun intended, about who will write which issue, um, you know what, just let me know if you can send me an email by, let's say tonight, OK? I realized I should have probably had you guys sort of. Aside your issues earlier so that you can get a little bit more of a jumpstart on, on the issues, but I also do wanna make very clear is that um even though in the brief, uh, and ultimately oral argument, you will be responsible for that, that particular issue, writing the issue and and arguing that particular issue. I really, really do want you to be very, very well versed. In the other issue and understanding what the other issue presents, the arguments, um, helping your partner with the other issue too, things like that. And part of the reason why is because it's a whole brief, right? And you're working together as a whole. I also think that as any advocate, I think it's very, uh, very dangerous to say the least, to not have no idea what the other issue is about, uh, you know. And for among other reasons too is that there are sometimes an interplay between two issues even if they seem disparate, sometimes because of the underlying facts of the case, because of arguments that you're going to make in your particular issue, you just want to make sure that it's not in some way intentionless or maybe even opposes or somehow the way it interacts with the other issue, and I think the The only way you can really know that is if you understand your partner's, uh, the other issue in the case. Um, I also think just as a learning exercise, I really want you to be very well versed in the whole, the whole brief, the whole fact pattern, and all the issues presented in both issues. So, um, and that's part of the reason why for tonight with our little breakdown of the groups, I think it would be a good start to kind of start talking about both issues. So I hope that will be helpful. So, I guess without further ado, uh, what we'll do is, I guess then since we haven't, uh, actually, out of curiosity, have, have, uh, Have pairings already decided their issues yet? No, have not? No one has decided their issues? OK. So, I guess what we'll do then, if that's the case, I guess we can then just do a breakdown of, let's see, we have 12.

SPEAKER 0
67, 8, 9, 10. OK.

SPEAKER 1
We have uh 5 here today, so why don't we do 5 and 5 just for now because we're gonna be swapping, uh, anyway, you know, as far as the, uh, you're gonna switch groups after 20 minutes or so. So I say we can just, um, how about we do this? We'll just do. Uh, sections of the class 123, Scarlett, Una, Max, right, Reham and Amira, can we do 5 with, uh, maybe Jacob first? Would that be OK? And then the next 5 here with, uh, Clemens, and then we'll for about 20 minutes we'll talk about the, you'll discuss the issues in that, and, uh, that, uh, the, the issues that Clemens and Jacob will address again. Clemens is, uh, copyright, right? I'm sorry, retaliation, sorry, and, uh, uh, Jacob is, uh, copyright. Got you, OK, and then we'll do the swap if that makes sense, OK. You guys want to work in any particular areas of the room? Does that matter?

SPEAKER 0
You can go over there. Yeah or I Oh I actually I, I know cases

SPEAKER 2
that we all take the retaliation.

SPEAKER 0
You actually. I I'll try to remember everybody's names. I might just, I'll be happy to. Like how did you feel a bit is this all yeah yeah. What's interesting, uh, I think that so far it seems like, uh, Echo Crap doesn't have a good case on on on the on the copyright. That's that's not right now we're not. No, no, no, we can't, we can't stop with that. How, how did you guys? Um, um, I, I, I, I mean, I'm like eopath. I think that so I mean we're the, uh, appelle, so I was writing like the description because you guys are you guys like the problem. And you've communicated somehow with your partners will not be a problem. Put on both issues, so if you guys have like it might be helpful just because it's like less like especially if we're splitting up these issues that each side only like you you only need to do half of this case essentially so it's. I think it's maybe a more complicated argument, yeah, what Jack, yeah, Jack, what, what actually happened like in this, in this case? What actually were the facts, uh, so essentially, yeah, yeah,

SPEAKER 3
because I was like I didn't read when I was like going over and I was like highlighting the points

SPEAKER 0
that I didn't mention.

SPEAKER 2
What's that? Oh, OK, so, uh, so essentially there was, uh, the employee, uh, was looking into the, uh, wanted, wanted to look into this gender-based potentially, uh, discrimination, uh, in terms of compensation, the bonuses, uh, he, it wasn't made clear, I think, uh, when he brought that to his. Exactly what they were looking into, there was like a little bit of confusion over that, uh, but he was given freedom to look into the, uh, the situation, uh, and then allegedly underperformance in his, uh, in his department. He eventually he was fired, so there was confusion over whether he was fired because of the, uh, what he was looking into versus if it was strictly his performance as they claimed, and so, uh, and then there was also the, the copyright issue of Echo Craft kind of copying the Paul Revere song and in which case, uh. Yeah, well, then when I went to trial on both issues they ruled in favor of echo craft for me and also saying that they didn't, there was no dispute over any, uh, material fact for the copyright issue or for the, uh, the finder.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah. What did you guys think? Is that persuasive or, um, like if you think that. What did you feel what like the general like argument is going to be, I, I guess the um the lower court like not necessarily from a legal standpoint, but not really from like a it's like something you could like you really excited it's like transformative so I think that's what like like. A theory of the case for you were concerned about like how they um yeah, I was more concerned with

SPEAKER 3
the cops don't know I think I felt sort of confused with the retaliation piece and that to my understanding is that this is like it's probably not in favor of echo craft, which is like who I'm supposed to be representing, but it was a decision on summary judgment, right?

SPEAKER 0
So in that situation. Supposed to be the facts and the moving party, and I think craft was the moving party, and so it

SPEAKER 3
surprises me in this case that given the facts they still ruled in favor of Echo craft and they decided to given the record to me it seemed like there's a strong argument to be made for like the causal connection between the fire and like I said. surprised that that theory of the case the president didn't go to trial in the summary judgment it's a really,

SPEAKER 0
really, really good observation like summary judgment about if, if the matter is like crystal clear, like if it's so clear that we don't even need to have a discussion. And here it seems it could at least raise doubts even if it's not yes, yes. Yeah, so you're saying that like that can't be true because of the fact that it's the same exact, yeah, they were trying to replace the, right, they didn't make the special and you keep circling back to education for school, all of those kind of and like the nonprofit that you own the you own these things that you need because they wanted to rehab image of this yeah. some days. Yeah, that's definitely, yeah, that's definitely something you wanna bring up about the profit is like, like they say as much profit, but like I'm being real, like a lot, like a lot of companies just have not for profit is great. Just for like the reputational stuff and like there's also numbers in the record that suggested that like they like bone went off faster but then and your reputation starts in the medical school everybody gets 5000 it was like oh that's ridiculous in the industry that it's not one thing, one thing that I was thinking what if all the female people in research but um came up with issues. Well, the presumption is that that I think it's good to, like, I like your argument like we know that like you know about the you have to show that like and like if you can have your theory of the case, um, like that's important then it could be like they were being vindicted towards him purposely exploiting his songwriting expertise and they invest in him because like they don't really care about they don't respect him like. Because it seems, you know, there's like a lot of it because like a lot of, um, they've also shown that like the, it, it was like the the firing was done because they say he's not a ban, but they said repeatedly he's like, um, and they also say like towards the end like I was like went up with like the virus things like and like these are like res but and it's already so that's like the two theories of cases that came up with at least you already mentioned, yeah, I mean.

SPEAKER 3
I think I might be getting things mixed up. I'm relating it back to like karma, but I can't remember if it was equal protection or due process, but like gender is like an intermediary protected class or something, right? So it's like there's a certain standard of whether or not like that action was related to like is it a justified action in practice based off of whatever justification they can come up with for like the policy overall, and it's sort of like a. Medium scrutinary scrutinary scrutiny standard um that be like the standard we're using or is this different?

SPEAKER 2
Are you talking about the Title 7 like from the actual record like yeah they're what this test is so there's this so on this record procedure, right?

SPEAKER 0
I just read the protected activity adverse action causal connection. 4 prongs on it right, so that's, that's just like it was like uh, yeah, was this, uh, was this statue triggered like this, um, I mean it doesn't have his name on the top, did he, did he do a protected activity? Did the employer know it was, yeah. So what this is going to come down to whether this. So like who knows if they already proved, right? Yeah, like in the office, yeah exactly so we don't even need to consider for years, but I think just like I'm kind of like that like one of my ideas I kind of like that's fired him doing this and then they do this very shortly thereafter, like a couple of weeks. So I just feel like the timeline in tandem with

SPEAKER 3
like all of the internal communications that clearly are, you know.

SPEAKER 0
They do a was there a particular activity? So just I think that uh, I think it's the

SPEAKER 2
act would be the investigation would be considered exploitation more

SPEAKER 0
confusion over whether or not it was properly.

SPEAKER 2
to the people above him that that was the protected it was even occurring and so I think that's a major issue do you already know which side you're going

SPEAKER 0
to be on? Will you be on rivern's side or will you be on? I'm on echograph who's on Ribbon's side um Ashley. Yeah, just in terms of like so in most in my, so convince me that there was a protected right now, um, like maybe just parody a song or to

SPEAKER 3
like quote a song even like requires a lot of like your own creative efforts to surrounding it to like actually create something new as opposed to just like taking

SPEAKER 0
your lines directly out, um, like I don't know, I

SPEAKER 3
found the parody argument just to be really uncompelling in general because of like the up.

SPEAKER 0
Generally using a parody and like.

SPEAKER 3
Uh, that would be that they, I don't know, like it's, I was kind of confused if that was HR person would ever used, um, but the, um, the investigation,

SPEAKER 0
it sounded quite a story. Um, Campbell, yeah, the Campbell was like such a. for the courts. I didn't think that it was a very good comparison. Yeah, so the other thing with like the whole parody thing is like we to argue that um yeah we just said like we have like certain amounts but like that I don't know that it's something and then so I'm gonna get a little um. That's the stuff that the overall new like what are the different like I just said difference. I mentioned the differences, yeah, like a lot more color for that to be like way more persuasive. So now you're talking about how like Paul Res class in a good light. Now he's not. And then, and like before like he like he puts down to that, or he wasn't secrets now he is, and there's other people, and then the ending and then what really, really. Really is some of the stuff is really going and talking about how like if I, if I heard when I heard this song, I like doing that when I heard this song I was actually questioning certain things and questioning things is extremely important to me you guys. He said that, yeah, so that's what I'm I think she really like not on but then she had really

SPEAKER 2
one that would point to the lack of comm proper communication about what.

SPEAKER 0
That's like, Oh yeah, well then I'd say he didn't

SPEAKER 2
look, I believe I forget the exact thing, but it's like he didn't. It was a pretty superficial investigation. They didn't look at other things that could be contributing to the, uh, compensation disparity other than, I believe, I forget exactly what it was. Do you, do you remember like the questions?

SPEAKER 0
Um, yeah. Uh, it was like an informal, it was, it seemed

SPEAKER 2
like an informal survey. It wasn't very comprehensive, so in which case I'd say you weren't even really getting to the root of the issue. You were just basing it off of I think when

SPEAKER 0
we summarized the facts section, what it was, as you said, like at the start it was just poking around, but they get two different bonuses. It wasn't always from the start like was it always. Yeah, not now. Yeah, exactly. Now all of a sudden you're going, uh, um, well,

SPEAKER 2
I'd say he wasn't. I'd even point to the fact that he was skeptical, uh, that disparity in compensation. It was gender based and I think he even admits that at some point in the record it says he wasn't sure he doubted that it could, it might be,

SPEAKER 0
uh, based on gender. Uh, but what you're saying is exactly correct. This gender issue just seems to creep in all the time just seems to be looking at. that's like if she knew all that would be incredibly persuasive, but then you take the next step and it's like the picture that comes up and you're like, yeah, but why did she think that? Well, he, uh, uh, I grab the person's like our song was more accurate, and she's just practice. So then that's another thing. And so I guess I don't know if you wanna say it. Realize it wasn't an investigation gender discrimination. It was just like we're not stick around, yeah, I would like to be like, like, yeah, instead of looking

SPEAKER 2
at the result, I don't know a general question, but

SPEAKER 3
is there like a point at which something could go from being like an unprotected activity to protected? So say for example someone had Like they sort of have this like I'm just putting feelers out there because it's like these bonus practices are weird and then they like conduct a survey and then they're like oh the data is pointing me in the direction that there is like a discriminatory discriminatory practice in play and then would like further investigation be considered protected if there's like con like concerns or allegations of discrimination.

SPEAKER 0
Um, so like people like like bonuses, yeah, so I can say this is an option verified the statutory criteria. I feel like she would have like that would be able to do. I don't know. I, I read that as just well I'm like so

SPEAKER 3
if it's like I also feel like, you know, after they do like the first survey and they're like the data looks facts are like and then they like raise the concern of gender explicitly would that. Then become like a protected activity or does it have to be like from the outset of like an investigation it has to be other people.

SPEAKER 2
I don't know if that would be I would, I would imagine because if you were if it changed you

SPEAKER 0
were and they're like, OK, like a patient or change

SPEAKER 2
like the purpose, I feel like that's completely line.

SPEAKER 0
Well, at least you'd be able to argue that it's a great area. Like, given that you're, given that you wanna crack across the side, you want to argue that this is closer to being more focused on at least to argue that actually this gets that gender very explicitly because it gets these lines that changed like changed the entire story. So it's now it's like it, would you mind if I call like Marvels controversy about things like what about like what really happened in the end there was like, it was actually that people like the songs like the whole point is this is. But in the conversation with Smith, uh, specifically says something

SPEAKER 2
about the number of women in the department that was getting, yeah, but if you're saying, but if you're bringing a concern about compensation, but if you're bringing a concern about compensation and then explicitly they note that the people being undercompensated are have more women in their department. That would be a good thing that implies that you're looking like you're interested in the conversation of women compared to men.

SPEAKER 0
I think if we're trying to say that this is a gray area, I guess from my perspective, but she doesn't know that it's getting at like where is that line?

SPEAKER 1
We'll do 5 minutes and then we'll do a switch

SPEAKER 0
of groups. When would it be? And obviously nobody starts right away with a huge flag. OK, we're going to do some gender survey 5 minutes. Always start with some suspicion somebody always begins with a maybe and now we're saying this is like, whoa, this was never about gender. Maybe it became that at some point. So where is that line? What would it have to look at so we can say this is not that because that's fashion we're different doesn't start off with gender and craft was gonna say, hey, this wasn't the summary judgment. It's really what's the what's the relevance. I just remember that we have 5 minutes left. Do you guys want to look at the other factors and just, like, even on like like my fault, it says like we didn't even tell it was about gender either. It's like, no, not, not we. They, they didn't even tell snip it was about gender. They said that there's a discrepancy between the departments, and that's part of what the argument to make.

SPEAKER 2
I, I'm gonna be arguing that. I'm just saying they're gonna come back and say we said it was the pardon me. More women are being undercompensated so that necessarily implicates that this research we're doing isn't looking into that despair. I just find it's like hard to say like all these elements are really convincing or pointing to echograph or summary judgment. That's the point that you need to make. No, no, I know, which is, I think that's like

SPEAKER 3
the weakest point. It's not that um there's no argument that there's like relatively to that. That's that it was issued on the summary judgment.

SPEAKER 0
Your problem is going to be that the facts are not crystal clear on this one. That's going to be OK, so this might be a stupid question, but yeah, summary judgment, nothing new that has

SPEAKER 2
developed can be brought. It's like just affirming whether like they're just looking into whether summary judgment was proper at that time, right, because then there wasn't there like some new evidence that comes out about how they like. Sniff someone looked at the uh report more closely afterwards and stuff like that, you are allowed to, yeah, like, are we just saying was the decision, like the first the district court's decision?

SPEAKER 3
I think they like set a sip like a stipulation date of like all the evidence they could review up to a certain point, so I guess so long that it's like fine.

SPEAKER 0
I think there's uh yeah, I think that's why you're thinking it's not like I. Convince me of the fact that say you written if you want to show defendant knew of the protected activity probably show that um, so, OK, yeah, so I, I would encourage you to go back and like dive deeper into that about the like if you want to make the argument to you you want you want to establish that um because I think you said a lot of like chat. Would everyone be ready to do the swapping of the

SPEAKER 1
groups or maybe wrap up, yeah, so let's work with

SPEAKER 0
this 4 factor test and then are we gonna do this focus on each factor and then we'll. Yeah, oh no, you're gonna get like a lot of

SPEAKER 2
us. Thank you. Thank you. I get some, I go get a bagel again.

SPEAKER 0
OK. No. Oh, I'm sure Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
but you're saying it's good or I'm just not.

SPEAKER 0
OK, I thought you're trying to tell me. I'll talk about the. Like, in relation to the issue, issue, where she sit?

SPEAKER 3
I yeah, I feel like I'm a spatial.

SPEAKER 0
I really can't remember. Sorry, yeah, hi. I'm doing good um. everybody's name. So yeah, I am. I'm talking about how you write. So I guess the first thing I wanna ask is you guys, so you guys have to write the record and you guys did your assignment on both issues. So I was just curious, do you guys have like a preference yet on like what you wanna do?

SPEAKER 2
I think I wanna do the other issue, the other

SPEAKER 0
issue, OK, the other issue, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK. Um, why is that, uh, I don't know.

SPEAKER 2
I just, I was honestly just finding it easier to write about when I was, it just was, OK, so

SPEAKER 0
is it like a, like a, like a topic thing, or is it like a thing?

SPEAKER 2
I don't know. I like the, the 4 factor test. I, I feel like I, I be able to talk about that. I forgot pretty clearly, um, so when you guys were

SPEAKER 0
watching first. That's what, what like when you guys did that in your assignment. Um, it started at like a holiday party and just

SPEAKER 3
like sort of a high level of like the goal of each party and like the general mentioned that they were in an argument that they're trying to make going into the appeal. Yeah, I would agree with that, um, something else and

SPEAKER 0
then. That I want to say before you getting into everything is like you guys should definitely take ownership over your argument and like feel very confident to like make initial decisions because and it kind of keeps on being brought

SPEAKER 3
up like like one of the like most fun parts

SPEAKER 0
of rewriting for me is like being creative finding that case that other people aren't finding like making like this frame and this angle this perspective like whatever like whatever I say like you know let that influence you maybe take it, but like. The women, but, um, so theory of the cases is like during the last. Oh. how you would explain your argument. So let's say it's like what do you mean like I'm like so you're gonna have to make this argument orally and it's like what is like the like what like what happened here? What happened here? So, um, on the so for. Investigation for echo craft you could say like they have so many minds to accentuate the differences like they they were they were intentionally keeping on purpose to accentuate the differences from the new song to the old song so like it's not copyright like this is like a creative choice that they made in order to like make a certain message. Like, and then like everything you keep, like everything that goes back to that, it's like you make like you go through all four prongs, but like I bet you're gonna have to argue this orderly so it's like as you're talking the judge you'd be like it's ridiculous like this is what they did. So that would be like one potentially here we go um and so that's a, that's a, that's a statutory standard that's a statutory standard. Uh, it's like sex, race, to to present a prima facie case of the Title VI discrimination is that like a matter of prove that it was a activity. It, it does feel like very fact intensive, especially if you get to adverse point where it's like adverse action and there's a relationship recovery adverse action. Did they did the principal because the principals that she chose them because like partially I guess because like their songs weren't accurate and like on that end it's like that's like like did all your news and stuff like that like that's fact intensive like that's how I assuming they want you to stay away from like doing this historical like uh research on like whether or not that's actually true or not but um I mean like when you get into like the cases like Campbell like Harper like they say a lot of things, but like what's Necessary to be considered a parody and like these are like relationship or connection like that's what like Campbell is all about and in Harper to to an extent is like um all of these factors like to what extent like informative and like what is a parody, what's not a parody what happens if you copy the like, are you, am I copying the creative process? Am I copying so onto that and like that's those are like all the things you need to show us the one really fact factual question that like. I see whether or not the second song's more accurate or not, but they purposely, um, well, but here's the thing is that the principal said that she went with the second song because it's more because they told her it's more accurate, but they're like, oh, OK, so you know it's more. I don't know. I I so like I, I sleep with my attic. I you guys or not um we only need to about one of the statutory, so she's making that decision based on like, oh I just got one they have to does it need to be better or does it just need to be transformed. And I think that echo crap, no, I think, I think, I think it's proved down all of them, but they have to prove that all three of them are so, but they, but it doesn't like make sense for the case to go through like all like 123, and then like there's reason why I think it's slightly relevant because like they't be discrimination it's there's no way that there's any doubt about 4 like you wanna ask like why did she go with like them. 3 already and it was just he was going back. Yeah, well, yeah, it sounds more accurate. No, yeah, what I was, what I was meaning more so is that like, yeah, and they can't, if we can't argue that you all know that they were like undercutting the market, they went to the same they would automatically give the same price. They, they give the same price, um, yeah, oh yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, that's why I would say that that's relevant, um, yeah, what, but what I, I guess what I'm trying to say is that You have to actually be better, yeah, I think that's what I was saying. Yeah, as long as I can say, well, they believe that they could have checked, they could, they would have checked and seen that it's exactly the same, and they wouldn't have gone with us, and then we would have been actually infringing. But yeah, so, so we don't, we don't matter. It's just they, they agree. You don't need to just prove, that's a really good argument. That's a really good argument because they're, they're gonna be arguing that, and then it's gonna be the principle is wrong and it's great. Um, what it comes down to is the more, the more you guys exactly more for like the opposing side, I think the only thing that helps us is maybe. Um, the email's bad like is very inflammatory and that would be like something the judge can walk away with, but it's like virus, he said to keep them in

SPEAKER 1
line, um, the CEO says it to the manager.

SPEAKER 0
I don't know what. Why doesn't see. I was, I would say the hallway for them this was like a, you know, you know, the bird in the hand is worth two birds in the bush. This was the bird in the hand. Like we already had the customer. Everything was locked and set. The work was already done. It was just, we just have to swoop in and grab this. Yeah, we'll do a little bit, you know, inconsequential stuff and call it a day, but we basically stole the customs, yeah, exactly, uh, and I would lean heavily on the port of problem and say, look, this person had money that had a deposit and he was, he was. that they are they're kind of aware that something is going on that, yeah, I think, I think it's really good. So then you would say that some of the most important facts are probably like the price, the timing, the, um, they keep on saying that like you said the reasons why they with like with, uh, echo craft over ribbons and stuff like the, I think that's really good. Yeah, I think, um, maybe another one of the theories for the case that I have for. Side, which I don't really like I'm going out there is that like the fight towards him specifically and she actually like about but like she does like do it once over it like goes back to the issue because like she's like oh if she doesn't read the last time she's your number actually I want to make that clear, but that just and then there's probably like a lot of facts and it's also a really good way to make a lot of facts that like are um. that you can use on your time, and one thing that I was about the fact is that they keep going back to saying they knew he got back and they're like he's a really good songwriter to say over and over again like they, um they say's a really good songwriter, and this in January he's like, I'm super impressed by his energy. He had high or whatever. So it's like this dude is clearly very good at writing songs and then towards the end they're also just like, oh, you were set up to fire. Like all these different things, so it starts me exactly, yeah, and then by May so angry about it and here's the conversation and it's it's someone like for like their like expertise when like you don't yeah yeah and it could also accentuate like. But the songwriting, that's why the song is so good. We couldn't do this ourselves, um, yeah, and then that, and that's how like that theory of the case, like you saying like the copyright aspect of it is like this song successful because of him. We've already told you a million times I get the songwriter. Like whether or not like like. Well, you know it. Like like whether or not we could have like there's also like even when it's like a very non-retaliator like the like down Douglas thing too you're like well we're still firing the songwriting. Well, it was in a similar position was not fired and had similar performance issues if the, if the song was out, it's like it's like fair use is only relevant according to the queues like on like the circumci she had way more experience I thought that. Well it's like for like why are you using it it's just like to make a statement about the word where you like it's a good song and we want money. And make money and like that's why like um like I feel like a really big positive of fact is that like that's like you know I mean it's like the song is good and they stole my song and they changed lines and not they changed lines because they had OK yeah so I feel like that's actually really significant because that's kind of the beginning of the retaliation. It almost feels though that while doing this like the human angle kind of makes it like maybe you know, compelling. Still below, you know, as Jeff said, every fair is exactly that, but not as much. Like half of YouTube is literally like doing some kind of you can also argue that that's the beginning of the retaliation and also they have to follow the law, and it seems like as far as our, our neighbor, they did exactly that and sold it in a legitimate by the laws and also they didn't make money on it. They gave it for free. So like, yeah, that's like part of. It's hard to try to say that we're not doing this. Yeah, and then that's all go it's like how, how do we use because like did they make money off it or did they not make money off of it because there's definitely arguments on both sides in terms of like the reputations revenue. I'll say, hey, all of this maybe I have in mind these negative like this one side is just like, obviously this is correct, and then you do the research and then you're like, oh this is actually very difficult, right? So, um, you know, if you want to lean into like that human side on on your thing, but like, yeah, I, I agree with like like the case law and then maybe I can say that that much. His work like significantly a question that I had because

SPEAKER 3
this is on like summary judgment and it's an appeal and I was kind of curious like how much the human side of an argument actually matters when it feels like when you're trying to appeal summary judgment. It really is like things as a matter of law and so it's case law dependent, um, yeah, I think

SPEAKER 0
it matters like this is. Well why, why I like, I might have like sort

SPEAKER 3
of an incorrect perception like summary judgment stuff, but I, my understanding of it was that it's like the facts are generally accepted and so it's more about like interpreting the accepted facts. Like knocked on the legal standards. So maybe like Moses was a longer term a longer

SPEAKER 0
leash and also she was sort of like, so it's actually generally accepted, but that doesn't mean that like they're feeling with the questions where like they, they don't know. So it's like like the record is accepted as true, but like a lot of things in the record are like. so I still think there's like a lot of room to work with, but yeah, like for example, we don't ever say whether the song its like more accurate or not, or they don't, um, yeah, like the idea about just like the whole money aspect of it like these things are like very unfair so if there's like contradictions in the facts, then like you're gonna wanna work with those on summary judgment because like at the end of the day the judge is gonna hear that and it's gonna like have like an emotional effect on them.

SPEAKER 1
I think in her department she was in the conversation,

SPEAKER 3
I think, right?

SPEAKER 0
And she also she also declined. She also was like, I don't wanna, I don't want. She was like, yeah, she was in the original conversation but she had nothing. She was like, I don't want to get here. Yeah, maybe she's been there so long as she knows there are. Yeah that's like the one that jumps out and that's like what like I like yeah exactly you want to go to something else and you totally do that and it'd be pretty cool because it'd be the very creative, um, yeah. Afield does seem like a lot, a lot. Yeah, there's no way he's doing this all lunchtime. And then there's also like the question of like humanizing the other side which you can you can try to do. I haven't done that yet, but like like there's no way there's no way to know like there was people humanizing like not like like not every, every lunch break, you know, for that so I wouldn't just like give up like if you talk to a person like the big company side give up. I'm this. that like like try to think creatively like if you try that side actually make it seem like like um. I haven't thought about that yet, so I, I wish I could say something, but it's part of that, that framing kind of, I don't know if it's, I'm sure

SPEAKER 2
there's a better word than this, but I'll use the

SPEAKER 0
word dehumanizing to say that he's not, he wasn't exploited. He's actually being exploited, uh. I don't know yet how, but like that's, that's kind of the story that Echo Kraft has to say. Yeah, I mean, the first, yeah, yeah, the easiest first thing you do is just be like you're doing that to me, like, like whatever he says, no, that's what you're doing to us, um, and yeah, you could say like, you know, he. Like they're gonna be like, no, like his song was inaccurate. My song is more accurate, and now like he's just like mad and he's trying to like I need to like dig into that one. I know that's the point that they, I think the point was like I like to his credits to go down or whatever the performance.

SPEAKER 2
Echo craft is educating the youth. Yeah, I was one of the kids. I, I think that's a story about kids here, and, and he's trying to take that trying to, he's trying to do a detriment to all the schools that perpetuating. Oh, that's so good.

SPEAKER 0
That's so good. That's so good. You can say like he's the one that cares about profit and they actually don't care and like she never prohibited like the other students, students from using every song. So as far as Egocraft is concerned, like. We use his song. We want him to get money. we just care about education. So if you put the song out there, we care about education. If they don't use your song, that's, that's what like we only care about kids.

SPEAKER 2
That's a legitimately don't even that monopoly always gives away

SPEAKER 0
something for free. It says, but you can go to Nett was the Netscape. What was that browser you can go to our competition for, for like a. Or you can use the Albert thing for free.

SPEAKER 2
Um, legitimately doesn't even care about the education of his own child. doesn't care. That's crazy. He cares more about the green than he cares about his daughter.

SPEAKER 0
I like that. And like he's trying to take this historically accurate song off of the market away from children just so he can make money, just so he can make money, yeah, so like you could. Put it that way. Why do we have to fight like a patent acquiring

SPEAKER 2
a patent just to sue other people. The pen would not do anything with the patent, but he didn't acquire the patent.

SPEAKER 0
He wrote a song.

SPEAKER 2
No, I know like the judge is going to hate us for saying that. I know, but I'm saying that craft is trying to do more good than the actually because they said they're

SPEAKER 0
selling it at a loss. He said that. You could have been profiting like the whole time, you know, fake news protecting them. He clearly just saw money after seeing how popular it was at the daughter's school, right? I mean, he didn't intentionally like start like obvious like like at the start he just wrote it for the April, but then he realized. And you could point to the thing where he's, uh,

SPEAKER 2
the, the tube in the principal said something like, I think there is a place in school to massage the facts a little bit and paint a better light or something. You could say that's, you can go market yourself to people like that who are trying to massage the massage history a little bit and so you have that mark.

SPEAKER 0
like like that that's actually mortify you can I mean like. Like going to what you said, there's no, there's no other argument for like his like investment like this is, it's kind of hard to say that like he cares about it can be very annoying, but it's like what, what else are you gonna like you care about copyright you say copyright like you care about like historical accuracy. Like there's no other argument there where it's like it's like the. The echo craft, like you're, you can't so scary start going at you. Let's say you, you, you and I try to talk and whenever you say two sentences, I just always interrupt you sorry like conversely like allowing like the, the circuit inaccurate or be to like circulate around like 8%. Or the boots when it's because like it's like the others of the firm in the room are like losing their minds a big part of you guys like he really cares what everyone thinks about part of you so um. backing that narrative up where she's just like, yeah, there's songs were accurate about way more than enough reason, and then she said, and then this is like the really key factors like for me, whereas like she said that after listening to American songs she like she thought who's in a good light or and then after listening to the other song she thought that she had questions about the full story and then the next thing she said is. that people are questioning even though don't get in that kind of like that that right there goes towards the 4th song and I think that's like a really, really hard to deal with for that but she explicitly says like I was questioning things after this song and this song only and then it's really important and you're right, it's like doesn't matter like. Because like she said the one thing about acur you saying don't fight with, but the other one is like this this song is making people question um so. who in our other issue is running around as a man trying to protect women and their moments, so it's like we're not gonna have an easy time it as like a money, he just grab his bonus and run. I mean if we're in clinic in the fall we'll we'll have to start talking to a judge, you know. I don't know if it's money. I think it's something else. It's some kind of a like white knight like person

SPEAKER 2
who's looking to make trouble. You can be someone who is looking out for women but also try to a money grab on the side once he got fired and started focusing on that you can. person Yeah, exactly, taken away from his investigation. Yeah, you know, I feel like, like, I feel like

SPEAKER 3
the argument that we're using for the retaliation piece of the captor would be that it was not actmination.

SPEAKER 0
We the guy or oh my God, yeah, like we both, we both, yeah, like to tie it into here

SPEAKER 3
and basically say he's not out here protecting people. He has a vendetta, but then we had to to

SPEAKER 0
check, yeah, exactly, and totally cut ourselves, yeah. Yeah, a great time.

SPEAKER 3
And so he checked out and started doing his own side thing and he was trying to like blow up that way.

SPEAKER 0
Is that an argument you guys are making for retaliation? Oh, that's great. And then you can be consistent across like most of the places. Yeah, yeah, that's really good. That's good. Is there anything you think is like, I don't think it's wicked. Um, I'm trying to be like Miranda and stuff because I find that kind of thing. Just the endless general questions like how how large are we like how creative can we get when we're arguing from like judges, not like juries, right, like. Pretty, pretty creative. I mean, like pretty creative is like your demeanor like really matters completely. Like don't, don't see that your demeanor definitely matters like, um, like I remember just little things like I had a case like last year about like this like, um, it was like a like a transgender ban on like health care and like the government like every time like the petitioners came up like they would like make sure to like reference like the the ban is like. 73 6 like just like really dehumanizing it and just being like, and then the other, the other side would be like, you know, framing it as like this like. Alrighty, I like, like, like unseen you and like that's something that like everyone needs so it's like if you don't sleep on like your tone how you I like me a little bit less, but definitely important. OK, thank you, Jacob. I I don't know. I was like, what if I hurt someone she's like. How'd it go? Really good.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you so much.

SPEAKER 0
I think a small group sessions. Yeah. It gets hard it's not. Singing is my partner. She's like, 00, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Hey everyone, I hope, uh, your group sessions were helpful in getting a little bit of a head start with, uh, our, uh, issues, uh, problem set here. Um, just a couple of things I guess wrap up, um. Any thoughts, comments, first of all, with regarding what, what was discussed in your groups? Do you have any sort of maybe follow-up questions or insights, thoughts that maybe we can address together, you know, with, with Clemens, Jacob, myself? Anything you wanted to talk about first? Any, cause I know, I'm sorry I had to sort of uh cut short your, your discussions. Any thoughts for now? No, OK, great, OK, so a couple of things, uh. Uh, when I was, uh, hearing and listening in a little bit to your, uh, on your discussions, it sounded very productive to me. I think it was great. Thank you, Clemens. Thank you, Jacob, for your leadership in, uh, in discussing the issues. Uh, I know that there was a little bit talk of, I heard about like a theory of the case, right, which I think is, is very, very important. I want you to start thinking about, uh, for your issue, issues about like what the theory of the case is, how, what, what you think you're going to argue, why, how would you Support that. That will, of course, include uh uh incorporating the, the relevant facts that pertain to your issue as well as, of course, the relevant research. I'm not sure where you guys are on your research, um, but again, continue your research. Sometimes I have found that um I just start writing. I start writing up uh facts and issues of the case with, with, uh, cases that I think I have, but then along the way, don't stop researching, OK? Because you may see along the way. As you're writing up that you might need another case or two to support a proposition or you look up, you're doing some research and you realize there's a case out there that might be kind of adverse to the position that you're taking that you may feel that you need to distinguish. So research is just constantly a constant thing and I think that as you write, rewrite or Review, revise, uh, your brief and your, your particular issue in the case. Just keep that in mind. Keep researching. Keep that always, it's like just sort of like an open box on the researching and stuff like that. Um, keep in mind always your theory of the case, whether or not you think you're gonna adjust or modify it along the way. Talk to your partners too, OK? You know, each, even though each of you are gonna be handling. Uh, uh, your, your, your particular issue. Again, it's, it's intertwined. It's, it's a whole case. It's a whole, whole brief, um, and sometimes if you, you know, you're a little stuck on your particular issue, remember your, your partner's there to brainstorm with you. I think that's one thing nice also about this assignment is that you're not writing in isolation, right? So, um, use your partner as a, as a resource. That's what it's like in real life too, right? When you work on, when you're gonna work on cases together with a partner. Um, and, and things like that. So, um, I want you to also keep in mind, right, what is the standard of review in this case? Um, what is the standard of review, review for the issues here, or for the issue for the case here? You know?

SPEAKER 0
No.

SPEAKER 1
De novo. That's right. Jeff, Did you just say demo? You just said de novo, right? OK. Yes, exactly. This was a motion for summary judgment, right? And the judge granted the motion for summary judgment as to both issues. So for the, uh, what court are we in? What, what court this, this appeal is bringing up to which, which uh court.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, say it again. So.

SPEAKER 1
The Second Circuit, right, which is a federal court, right? New York, uh, I'm sorry, not New York Court of Justice, excuse me, United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, right? So the appellate court here is gonna review these issues, uh, based on de novo, and what does de novo mean?

SPEAKER 0
Are you Exactly.

SPEAKER 1
Right, it's a, it's a, it's not, it's, it's basically the court, the Second Circuit in this case can start anew and basically saying, OK, you know, the district court here ruled a certain way. We may feel totally different for these reasons. It is, it's a new, it's a new. It's basically uh uh what the, what the Second Circuit would do under these same circumstances, um, so it's not, for example, a, a case of like, for example, sometimes some standards of review are, can you think of any other kind of standards of review that there are um. Abuse of discretion. Yeah, abuse of discretion. This is almost a de novo is almost the other end of abuse of discretion, right? And knowing your standard of review is really important because that will shape how you argue this case, how you brief it and how you argue this case. Um, I think that for example, let's say, so I think that it's not uncommon for, I think, for MOC court problems in law school, schools, law schools to be like a, a de novo because you're basically gonna be able to kind of both sides, it's a little even, you can just sort of argue what the answer should be for the court because the court can just sort of look at this anew, um, versus let's say if it was an abuse of discretion. I find that abuse of discretion cases, it's a little harder, I think for, for the uh appellant, right? If they lost below and then the review is abuse of discretion, it's probably generally gonna be a little bit harder to prevail, uh, unless totally the record and the, the district court will model or the, the lower court, the trial court just totally got it wrong, which again, and I think in a fact pattern you're not often gonna have that, but in real life. Appellants, respondents like abuse of discretion, you know, because if there's a lot of deference that the, the appellate court is supposed to give to the lower court, um. Uh, another thing too is again think about what is the relief that you want, yeah, yeah, what is the relief that you're requesting here as the appellant and as the respondent here, um, and what is that relief that you want? What does the appellant want here?

SPEAKER 0
Excision to be reversed. Right, exactly.

SPEAKER 1
And what does the respondent want here?

SPEAKER 0
Have the summary judgment sustained. Correct.

SPEAKER 1
Exactly. OK. That's kind of fairly straightforward, right? But I just want you to think in mind that even beyond this problem set, um, lawyers often have to think about when their position that they're gonna take and what they're asking for. It may seem rather basic, but again this will shape your argument is. What relief do I want, you know, is it like an affirmance reversal only, or is there also an alternative relief? Is there any issue about you want at a minimum, maybe a case to be sent back to the district court to resolve certain issues assuming it can be done? Or do you want any other type of relief? Um, so that's another thing I'd like you to kind of keep in mind even beyond the sort of problem set. What is the relief that you are requesting, um, and, uh, and I, I'll give you an example, just real life example today, uh, like at work for me, uh, on habeas matter. Now, it's not in front of the appellate court yet, it's still at the trial court level, Supreme Court, but the position that my office wants to take on the habeas relief is that usually habeas relief when a state habeas petition is brought. The petitioner, the gist of what the petitioner is saying is that he or she is being unlawfully detained and therefore, in most cases, the relief should be if, if, if, if the petitioner's uh position is, is, uh, meritorious, uh, or at least the habeas court finds that the relief should be that the petitioner should be released from detention. Um. But in the particular case that we, that was presented, uh. Our argument is that actually the relief should be, could be one of two things is that if there is an issue here, whether or not the bail court didn't make a sufficient record as to why the key, uh, the court imposed high bail in this case or what the petition alleges is high bail and why the defendant ended up not being able to make bail and is currently in Rikers, um, is that the habeas court has to send it back to the bail court. To make that sufficient record. Um, it's not a straight out release. Um, so that's really, really the basic things that we're saying what is the release and that's why it's very important because that helps again what I'm trying to say is how it shapes your argument basically in that regard. Um, let's see. I, I heard also talk a little bit about oral arguments, and I know we're a little bit jumping ahead, but I think that, um, I think you're gonna have a really fun time with oral arguments. It's really gonna be a great time for you to sort of defend your position in front of judges who are going to interrupt you and try to make you, and try to counter your position here. Uh, and, uh, I think it'll be really great. I would like to, um, and we'll discuss this more in Clemens, Jacob will discuss it too, but I, I would like to plan a class trip. Uh, I, I think I'll have to see what your schedule is like too, but, uh, it could be one of probably what I'm thinking right now in, in person of one of maybe two courts, appellate courts. It could be the appellate division first department, which is Is uh on 25th Street between Madison and Park or perhaps we can go to the, uh, Court of Appeals Second Circuit, which is in lower Manhattan, and since that's the court that you are bringing this appeal to in your moot court problem, so I would like that to kind of keep that in mind just to kind of so that you can see sort of arguments in action. If we go to the
