# ISSUE TWO: EchoCraft's Song Constitutes Fair Use as a Matter of Law

## A. Governing Rule

**Fair use requires case-by-case analysis of four statutory factors:**

- (1) The purpose and character of the use, including whether commercial or nonprofit educational
- (2) The nature of the copyrighted work
- (3) The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole
- (4) The effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

Courts must explore all four factors together and weigh them holistically; no single factor is dispositive.

*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 577-78 (1994); 17 U.S.C. § 107.

**Fair use may be decided on summary judgment when:**

- Material facts are undisputed
- The question is whether those facts establish fair use as a matter of law
- The inquiry focuses on objective characteristics a reasonable observer would perceive, not subjective intent

*Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 34 (2d Cir. 2025); *Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508, 544 (2023).

## B. Factor One Strongly Favors EchoCraft: The Song Is Transformative Parody Serving a Distinct Educational Purpose

**The central question under Factor One:**

- Whether the new work adds something new with a further purpose or different character, or merely supersedes the original
- The more transformative the new work, the less significance other factors (like commercialism) carry against fair use
- Courts examine the specific challenged use in the marketplace through objective inquiry into what a reasonable observer would perceive

*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579; *Andy Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 526, 545.

**Parody has a stronger fair use claim than satire:**

- Parody = commentary on the original work itself
- Satire = commentary on society using the original
- Parody requires conjuring up the original to make its critical point
- The parody must target the original, not just its general style, genre, or society as a whole
- The secondary work's commentary must have **critical bearing** on the original work itself

*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580-81; *id.* at 597 (Kennedy, J., concurring); *Andy Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 546-47 (quoting *Campbell*).

**Nonprofit educational purpose weighs in favor of fair use:**

- Commercial nature tends against fair use but is not dispositive
- Statutory language explicitly distinguishes commercial from nonprofit educational uses

*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 584.

### Application:

**EchoCraft's song constitutes parody with critical bearing on Riven's work:**

- Riven's song presents a "hero-worship" perspective on Paul Revere
- EchoCraft targets and mocks that adulatory perspective by correcting historical inaccuracies
- The question mark in the title signals ironic interrogation of the original's claims
- EchoCraft uses Riven's melody to "conjure up" his version, then undermines its narrative with corrected facts
- The critical bearing is direct: commentary on the original's uncritical, mythologizing approach

**Reasonable observer would perceive distinct purposes:**

- Riven's version: celebratory, mythic narrative for entertainment
- EchoCraft's version: ironic critique and factual correction to expose inadequacies
- Functionally different: uncritical hero-worship vs. corrective commentary

**EchoCraft's nonprofit educational purpose:**

- Operates as nonprofit educational entity
- Licenses work below cost
- Distributes exclusively for educational purposes
- Combines with transformative critical nature to strongly favor fair use

## C. Factor Two Is Neutral or Favors EchoCraft: The Original Work Is Educational and Factual

**Nature of copyrighted work considers:**

- Whether work is creative or factual, published or unpublished
- Creative works receive greater protection than factual compilations
- This factor typically has limited weight when copying work is clearly transformative parody
- Educational works presenting historical facts occupy middle ground with less robust protection

*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586; *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 348-49 (1991).

### Application:

**Riven's song is fundamentally educational and factual:**

- Designed to teach historical facts about Paul Revere
- Contains creative elements but core purpose is factual dissemination
- Diminishes strength of copyright protection relative to purely imaginative works
- Parody almost invariably copies publicly known, expressive works
- Factor Two adds little when Factor One demonstrates clear transformative purpose

At most neutral; more likely slightly favors EchoCraft given educational and factual nature of underlying work.

## D. Factor Three Favors EchoCraft: Copying the Melody Was Necessary to Conjure Up the Original, and EchoCraft Departed Markedly in Lyrics

**Parody may copy the "heart" of the original:**

- Necessary to "conjure up" the original for purposes of making recognizable criticism
- Parody must evoke at least enough of original to make object of critical wit recognizable
- Copying does not become excessive merely because portion taken was the original's heart
- The heart is what most readily conjures up the work for parody and is the heart at which parody takes aim
- **But: parodist must depart markedly from the original after establishing the connection**

*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 588-89.

### Application:

**EchoCraft copied 87.5% of melody but changed 100% of lyrics:**

- Melody is the "heart" that makes Riven's song memorable and pedagogically effective
- For educational songs, melody serves as mnemonic device facilitating memorization
- Children learn historical facts by associating them with familiar tunes
- To criticize Riven's pedagogical approach, EchoCraft needed to conjure up his version using same melodic structure

**EchoCraft departed markedly in lyrics:**

- 100% lyrical departure with completely rewritten narrative
- Presents corrected historical facts that undermine Riven's adulatory perspective
- Demonstrates EchoCraft took only what necessary to establish parodic connection
- Then pursued its own critical and educational ends

**High percentage of melodic copying justified:**

- Unique functional requirements of educational music parody
- Melody itself is integral to the pedagogical method being criticized

## E. Factor Four Strongly Favors EchoCraft: No Derivative Market Exists for Criticism, and Any Harm Is from Critical Suppression, Not Substitution

**Factor Four asks about market substitution, not critical damage:**

- Whether secondary use usurps the market by serving as substitute
- NOT whether it damages market through effective criticism or parody
- When parody suppresses demand through effective criticism, it does not produce harm cognizable under Copyright Act
- Courts must distinguish biting criticism that merely suppresses demand from infringement that usurps it by offering competing substitute

*Santos*, 154 F.4th at 35 (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 189 (2d Cir. 2024)); *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 591-92 (quoting *Fisher v. Dees*, 794 F.2d 432, 438 (9th Cir. 1986)).

**No protectible derivative market for works that criticize the original:**

- Copyright holders would not license others to create critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions
- This unlikelihood removes such uses from very notion of potential licensing market
- Prevents copyright holders from using control over derivative works to suppress criticism

*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592; *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 35.

### Application:

**No derivative market exists for educational songs criticizing Riven's work:**

- Even if Riven has/could develop educational licensing market, that market encompasses entertainment-educational derivatives
- Does not and cannot extend to critical-educational derivatives pointing out why Riven's version is inadequate
- Riven would never license corrected versions exposing his song's flaws
- Derivative works right protects markets copyright holder would actually exploit
- Does not extend to works holder would never authorize (criticism of own work)
- EchoCraft operates in "no licensing market" zone of criticism, not in competition with Riven's licensing opportunities

**Any harm results from critical suppression, not market substitution:**

- If schools reject Riven's song after encountering EchoCraft's version, it's because criticism is effective
- Educators realize Riven's version teaches false or misleading history
- This is precisely the harm criticism inflicts—not cognizable under copyright law
- Schools not choosing EchoCraft as entertaining substitute for same entertainment purpose
- They're rejecting Riven's pedagogical approach after confronting its shortcomings
- EchoCraft criticizes original work, reducing demand through power of critique
- Not usurping demand by offering competing substitute for same function

**Riven has no established educational licensing market:**

- Only preliminary negotiations with schools
- No executed contracts or licensing revenue generated
- Market is primarily commercial entertainment
- EchoCraft's nonprofit educational use (below cost to schools) doesn't compete in commercial entertainment market
- Even if Riven develops educational licensing market, it would be for uncritical derivatives
- Not for works exposing inadequacies of his historical treatment

Factor Four strongly favors EchoCraft: no cognizable market harm through substitution, no protectible derivative market for criticism, no established licensing market that EchoCraft could usurp.
