# BRIEF OUTLINE: EchoCraft Productions (Appellee)

## Riven v. EchoCraft Productions - Issue 2: Fair Use Defense

**Student:** Moshe Klein
**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Side:** Appellee (EchoCraft Productions)
**Issue:** Whether the district court properly granted summary judgment finding fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107

---

## I. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

Whether the district court properly granted summary judgment holding that EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" constitutes fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 where:

1. EchoCraft released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary division at or below cost for the purpose of correcting historical inaccuracies and prompting critical discussion;
2. The song copied seven lines verbatim (87.5%) but added seven new lines (50% new content) that transformed the original's celebratory message into critical educational inquiry;
3. The verbatim copying of seven lines was necessary to establish the traditional narrative before questioning it; and
4. Appellant lost a single preliminary negotiation with no signed contract, agreed price, or established licensing market.

---

## II. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

### Overall Theme

This case presents paradigmatic fair use: transformative criticism that corrects factual inaccuracies in a copyrighted work. EchoCraft's song transforms Riven's celebratory memorization tool into critical inquiry about historical narratives—precisely the type of commentary, criticism, and teaching that 17 U.S.C. § 107 explicitly protects.

### Factor-by-Factor Preview

All four statutory factors support fair use:

**Factor 1** (purpose/character) heavily favors fair use: The work is transformative, educational, and nonprofit, released to correct historical errors and prompt critical thinking.

**Factor 2** (nature) slightly favors Appellant but carries minimal weight per *Campbell*: Riven's work consists largely of factual historical content with limited creative expression.

**Factor 3** (amount/substantiality) favors fair use: While percentage of lyrics copied is high (87.5%), the copying was reasonable and necessary to accomplish the critical purpose of establishing the traditional narrative before questioning it. The 50% new content directly corrects the copied lines.

**Factor 4** (market effect) strongly favors fair use: No established market existed—only preliminary negotiations without contract, price, or agreement. Appellant's loss stems from market preference for a superior educational work, not impermissible substitution.

**Holistic Analysis:** Viewed together and in context, all factors support affirming summary judgment. The strong transformative purpose dominates the analysis, and public interest in historically accurate education reinforces the fair use finding.

## III. ARGUMENT OUTLINE

### A. STANDARD OF REVIEW & SUMMARY JUDGMENT FRAMEWORK

#### 1. Standard of Review

- De novo review of fair use determination (legal question)
- Second Circuit precedent on appellate review standards
- **FINDING:** Fair use is legal question reviewed de novo when based on undisputed facts

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- Find 2d Cir. cases explicitly stating standard of review for fair use determinations on appeal
- Cases where appellate court reversed district court's fair use finding (to understand deference given)
- Post-Warhol 2d Cir. cases addressing standard of review

#### 2. Summary Judgment Standards Applied to Fair Use

- Fair use can be decided as matter of law when no genuine factual disputes exist
- Disputed legal characterization (e.g., "is use transformative?") does not preclude summary judgment
- **FINDING:** "Is this transformative?" = legal characterization, not factual question for jury
- Competing inferences from undisputed facts don't create genuine factual dispute

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases granting summary judgment on fair use where parties disputed transformativeness
- Cases distinguishing factual disputes from legal characterization disputes
- When does fair use require trial vs. summary judgment in 2d Circuit?

#### 3. Burden on Appeal

- Burden on Appellant to show district court abused discretion
- District court's factual findings reviewed for clear error
- Legal conclusions reviewed de novo

---

### B. FACTOR ONE: PURPOSE AND CHARACTER OF USE 

**Opening Thesis:** Factor 1Adulatory favors fair use because EchoCraft's song is transformative criticism that fundamentally changes the purpose, message, and pedagogical function of Riven's work.

#### 1. The Transformativeness Standard Post-*Warhol*

##### a. Controlling Authority

- *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music*, 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994): Transformativeness = "whether new work adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message"
- *Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508 (2023): Focus on "purpose and character"—how does use differ from original?
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** *Warhol* significantly restricts transformativeness for same-market uses: "if original work and secondary use share the same or highly similar purposes, and secondary use is commercial, first factor likely weighs against fair use"
- *Hachette Book Group v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163 (2024): Post-Warhol 2d Cir. case rejecting educational fair use where "underlying purpose of making Works available in derivative format is still the same"
- *Warhol* clarified: Commentary must have "critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition" to justify copying

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- Post-Warhol 2d Cir. cases where educational use succeeded despite same market overlap
- Cases distinguishing "same market category" from "same purpose" under Warhol
- 2d Cir. cases applying "critical bearing" standard to non-parody criticism

##### b. Application: Three Dimensions of Transformation

1. **Changed Purpose:**

   - Original: Celebrate Revere as "great man" (Record p.27)
   - EchoCraft: Question whether Revere should be revered (Record p.86-87)
   - Original reinforces an adulatory narrative; EchoCraft challenges it
2. **Changed Message:**

   - Original: Revere acted alone, "revealed no secrets"
   - EchoCraft: Multiple riders (Dawes, Prescott, Ludington), Revere "revealed some secrets," was "skittish"
   - Original perpetuates historical inaccuracies; EchoCraft corrects them
3. **Changed Pedagogical Function:**

   - Original: Memorization tool for passive learning
   - EchoCraft: Critical thinking prompt soliciting "critical discussion" (Toobin testimony, Record p.__)
   - Original = rote learning; EchoCraft = analytical engagement

##### c. Supporting Factual Record

- Raine testimony: Purpose was "deep rumination on problematic character" (Record p.76-77)
- Title itself signals critical inquiry: "Revere Paul Revere?" vs. "Revere Paul Revere"
- Question mark = interrogative rather than declarative
- Toobin testimony: EchoCraft version "solicits critical discussion" original doesn't

#### 2. Educational Correction as Fair Use Category

##### a. Statutory "Criticism, Comment, Teaching"

- 17 U.S.C. § 107 preamble lists "criticism, comment... teaching"
- Correcting factual inaccuracies = criticism of substantive errors
- Not just meta-commentary—correcting the work's actual claims
- **FINDING:** Courts interpret "criticism" broadly to include substantive correction, not just meta-commentary
- *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579: Criticism applies "whether comment makes erudite point or prosaic point"
- **Strong Presumption:** *In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube*, 581 F.Supp.3d 509 (S.D.N.Y. 2022): "Strong presumption that factor one favors defendant if allegedly infringing work fits description of uses described in section 107"
- *Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co.*, 836 F.Supp. 909 (D. Mass. 1993): Works that "fit comfortably within statutory categories" and "add value to prior intellectual labor" receive fair use presumption
- *Keeling v. Hars*, 809 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2015): Works can be BOTH derivative AND critical/educational when transforming "purpose and character" not just form

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases where factual correction of educational materials qualified as "criticism"
- Cases distinguishing criticism of work's substance vs. using work to discuss broader topics
- How does "critical bearing" requirement apply to factual inaccuracy corrections?

##### b. Public Interest in Historical Accuracy

- Copyright doesn't protect false historical claims
- Fair use promotes accurate information in educational materials
- Denying fair use would insulate inaccurate works from correction
- **FINDING:** *Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340 (1991): "Most fundamental axiom of copyright law is that no author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates"
- *Narell v. Freeman*, 872 F.2d 907 (9th Cir. 1989): "Scope of permissible fair use is greater with informational work than with creative work"
- *Red Label Music Publishing v. Chila Productions*, 388 F.Supp.3d 975 (N.D. Ill. 2019): Fair use protects against "chilling effects of allowing artist too much control over dissemination for historical purposes"

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases explicitly discussing public interest in correcting historical inaccuracies
- Cases where false factual claims in copyrighted works were corrected via fair use
- Role of First Amendment considerations in educational fair use analysis

#### 3. Nonprofit Educational Distribution

##### a. Primary Purpose Test

- Released through EchoCraft Ed (nonprofit educational subsidiary of for-profit parent company)
- Parent company EchoCraft Productions is major for-profit record label
- Licensed at/below cost ($200 to schools) (Record p.74-75)
- No direct profit from song sales
- Primary purpose: educational improvement
- **FINDING:** *Hachette Book Group v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163 (2024): "Crux of profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether sole motive is monetary gain, but whether user stands to profit from exploitation of copyrighted material without paying customary price"
- *Mayo Clinic v. United States*, 145 F.4th 877 (8th Cir. 2025): "Primary purpose" means "substantial" purpose, not "principal or most important" purpose
- Organization can have multiple substantial functions while maintaining educational characterization if non-educational activities remain "merely incidental"

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases applying "primary purpose" test to subsidiary organizations
- What pricing structure (at-cost, below-cost, subsidized) supports nonprofit characterization?
- Cases distinguishing substantial vs. incidental commercial activities

##### b. Incidental Commercial Benefits Don't Defeat Fair Use

- Parent company PR benefits are incidental to primary educational purpose
- Revenue improvement (-5% to +2%) correlates with, but not caused solely by, song release
- *Campbell* rejects binary commercial/nonprofit distinction
- **FINDING:** *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 163: Nonprofit "obtains only those nonmonetary benefits that attend most other legitimate, secondary uses, including advancing its mission and bolstering its reputation"
- "Characterizing these general benefits as commercial profits would render commercial the activities of virtually any nonprofit organization that bolsters its reputation through its own nonprofit activities" (*Hachette*)
- DISTINGUISH: *Lish v. Harper's Magazine Foundation*, 807 F.Supp. 1090 (S.D.N.Y. 1992): Commercial use found where "Harper's objective is to sell magazines at profit" despite nonprofit status

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases on parent-subsidiary relationships in fair use analysis
- University press or similar nonprofit publishing cases with reputational benefits
- What level of revenue correlation triggers commerciality finding?

##### c. Rejecting Appellant's "PR Scheme" Argument

- Appellant will characterize nonprofit as sham to boost parent company
- Response: Structure matters—actual nonprofit division, actual below-cost licensing
- Compare to universities' publication programs—incidentally enhance reputation but still nonprofit
- [RESEARCH NEEDED: Cases upholding fair use despite reputational benefits to related entities]

#### 4. Same-Market Uses Post-*Warhol*

##### a. *Warhol* Distinguished

- *Warhol*: Magazine licensing (same purpose and market as original)
- Here: Different purpose (critical inquiry vs. celebration)
- *Warhol* doesn't foreclose fair use in same market when purpose fundamentally differs
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** *Warhol* creates strong presumption against same-market uses BUT requires analysis of PURPOSE not just market category
- *Warhol*: "If original work and secondary use share the same or highly similar purposes, and secondary use is commercial, first factor likely weighs against fair use"
- **Key Distinction:** Purpose = function/character, not market category
- *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30 (2d Cir. 2025): Found fair use for commercial TV show because use had "further purpose or different character" - transformativeness analysis "turns on what reasonable observer thinks"

**CRITICAL NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- Post-Warhol cases distinguishing "same market" from "same purpose"
- Educational cases where transformative purpose overcame market overlap
- How do courts define "purpose" vs. "market category" post-Warhol?
- Cases applying "critical bearing" requirement to educational criticism

##### b. Educational Market Overlap ≠ Same Purpose

- Both works target AP History students (market overlap)
- But serve different pedagogical functions
- Market category (education) vs. market purpose (memorization vs. critical thinking)

#### 5. Necessity of Copying (Bridging to Factor 3)

- Copying necessary to establish what is being criticized
- Cannot correct historical errors without reproducing the erroneous lines
- *Campbell*: May copy "the heart" when purpose is critical commentary
- **FINDING:** *Warhol* confirmed "conjure up" extends beyond parody: "Other commentary or criticism that targets an original work may have compelling reason to 'conjure up' the original by borrowing from it" (598 U.S. at [cite])
- **BUT:** Must have "critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition" - commentary without critical bearing "diminishes" fair use claim
- *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 588: Parody must "conjure up" original to make point about it

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases applying "conjure up" to non-parody criticism
- How much copying is "necessary" to criticize factual inaccuracies?
- Cases where courts found copying exceeded what was necessary for criticism

**Factor 1 Conclusion:** Strong transformation in purpose, message, and pedagogical function; nonprofit educational distribution; falls within statutory categories of criticism and teaching. Factor 1 weighs heavily in favor of fair use.

---

### C. FACTOR TWO: NATURE OF COPYRIGHTED WORK

**Opening Thesis:** Factor 2 weighs slightly in Appellant's favor but carries minimal weight in the holistic analysis, as *Campbell* instructs.

#### 1. Acknowledging Riven's Creative Work

- Song is original creative work (lyrics, rhyme scheme)
- Published work (registered copyright)
- Factor 2 generally favors copyright holder for creative works

#### 2. Diminished Weight Per *Campbell*

- *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586: Factor 2 "not likely to help much" in analysis of creative works
- Factor 2's role is limited when Factor 1 transformation is strong
- **FINDING:** Factor 2 carries minimal weight in transformative use analysis
- Strong Factor 1 transformation can overcome Factor 2 weighing against defendant
- Courts routinely minimize Factor 2 when transformation is clear

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases where strong Factor 1 overcame adverse Factor 2
- Post-Warhol treatment of Factor 2 in Second Circuit
- Does Factor 2 ever tip balance when other factors are mixed?

#### 3. Factual/Informational Content Reduces Protection

##### a. Primarily Factual Subject Matter

- Historical events (Paul Revere's ride, 1775)
- Geographic locations (Boston, Charlestown, Concord, Lexington)
- Famous phrases ("one if by land, two if by sea")—not original to Riven
- Dates and names = unprotectable facts
- **FINDING:** *Feist*, 499 U.S. at 340: Facts themselves receive NO copyright protection
- *Estate of Smith v. Cash Money Records*, 253 F.Supp.3d 737 (S.D.N.Y. 2017): "Ordinary historical facts and events are not protectable elements under Copyright Act"
- *Leary v. Manstan*, 118 F.Supp.3d 460 (D. Conn. 2015): Historical phrases unprotectable as historical facts or public domain content

##### b. Educational Purpose = Informational Character

- Functional purpose: teach history
- Not primarily aesthetic/entertainment
- Informational works receive less protection than purely creative works
- **FINDING:** *Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings*, 931 F.Supp.2d 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2013): "Works predominantly factual are farther from core of intended copyright protection, and scope of fair use is broader with respect to factual works"
- *Narell*, 872 F.2d at 907: "Scope of permissible fair use is greater with informational work than with creative work"

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- How do courts separate factual vs. creative elements in mixed works?
- What percentage factual content shifts fair use balance?
- Cases analyzing educational songs as informational vs. creative works

**Factor 2 Conclusion:** Weighs slightly against fair use, but carries minimal weight per *Campbell*, especially given strong Factor 1 transformation and work's factual/informational character.

---

### D. FACTOR THREE: AMOUNT AND SUBSTANTIALITY OF PORTION USED

**Opening Thesis:** While the proportion copied is significant (57 of 66 words, or 86.4% of the original work), the copying was reasonable and necessary to accomplish EchoCraft's critical purpose. Factor 3 weighs in favor of fair use, or at worst is neutral.

#### 1. Acknowledging Quantitative Copying

- **Precise word count analysis:**
  - Riven's original: 66 words (8 lines) (Exhibit G)
  - EchoCraft's song: 116 words (14 lines) (Exhibit H)
  - Words copied verbatim or nearly verbatim: 57 words
  - Percentage of Riven's work copied: 86.4% (57/66 words)
  - Copied words as percentage of final work: 49.1% (57/116 words)
  - New original content: 59 words (50.9% of final work)
- Substantial quantitative overlap from original work
- However, EchoCraft added equal amount of new content
- Must address forthrightly and justify the extent of copying

#### 2. Reasonableness Standard from *Campbell*

##### a. Copying Must Be Viewed in Context of Purpose

- *Campbell*: May copy enough to "conjure up" the original
- Here: Must establish traditional narrative before questioning it
- Cannot effectively criticize inaccurate historical claims without reproducing them
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** Highest percentage approved in 2d Cir. for criticism = only 4.3% (*Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, 803 F.2d 1253 (2d Cir. 1986))
- **BUT:** *Maxtone-Graham* held "there are no absolute rules as to how much of copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered fair use"
- Courts conduct both quantitative AND qualitative analysis under "fragmented literal similarity" test
- *TufAmerica, Inc. v. Diamond*, 968 F.Supp.2d 588 (S.D.N.Y. 2013): Must consider "qualitative and quantitative significance" of copied portions

**CRITICAL NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases approving >50% copying for critical purposes (URGENT - our 87.5% is extremely high)
- Cases where high percentage was justified by necessity for criticism
- How do courts apply "heart" analysis to educational/historical works?
- Factual content percentage in substantiality analysis

##### b. Necessary vs. Excessive Copying

- Test: Could critical purpose have been achieved with less?
- Here: No—corrections require showing what is being corrected
- Seven lines contain the specific inaccuracies EchoCraft corrects
- Could not write "Revere revealed some secrets" without context of original's "revealed no secrets"
- Could not add "though others helped raise that warning's light" without first establishing original's implication that Revere acted alone
- The verbatim copying establishes the baseline narrative that the new content then corrects
- **FINDING:** *Penguin Random House LLC v. Colting*, 270 F.Supp.3d 736 (S.D.N.Y. 2017): Copying "not necessary to serve transformative purpose" where "nearly all of infringers' books were devoted to telling copyrighted stories, with only two pages purporting to analyze"
- Court scrutinizes whether less copying could accomplish same critical/educational goals
- Copying must be necessary for the specific critical purpose, not just helpful

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases defining "necessary" vs. "convenient" copying
- How do courts assess whether defendant could have used less?
- Cases where necessity justified extensive verbatim copying

#### 3. Qualitative Analysis: What Was Copied?

##### a. Factual Content vs. Creative Expression

- Much of copied material = historical facts (dates, locations, "one if by land")
- Famous phrases not original to Riven
- Limited creative expression in factual recitation
- **FINDING:** Courts differentiate factual content (unprotectable) from creative expression (protectable)
- *Feist*: Only creative expression protectable; facts, dates, names receive NO protection
- *Edwards v. Raymond*, 22 F.Supp.3d 293 (S.D.N.Y. 2014): Common phrases lack originality and exist in public domain
- *Leary v. Manstan*: Historical phrases unprotectable; only "original expression—author's particular manner of selecting, coordinating, excerpting, modifying, and arranging" is protectable
- Must conduct line-by-line analysis separating fact from creative expression

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- How do courts quantify percentage of factual vs. creative content in copied material?
- Cases breaking down historical narratives into protectable/unprotectable elements
- Does rhyme scheme count as creative expression separate from factual content?

##### b. "Heart" of Work

- *Campbell*: May copy "heart" for critical commentary
- Heart of educational song = historical content
- Riven doesn't claim copyright in historical facts
- [RESEARCH NEEDED: Application of "heart" copying in educational contexts]

#### 4. Substantial New Content Demonstrates Limited Taking

- 59 new words added (50.9% of final work; 116 total words vs. 66 original)
- Not mere reproduction—substantial original contribution equal to original's length
- New content transforms message (Dawes, Prescott, Ludington, questioning tone, "incomplete" history)
- EchoCraft nearly doubled the length: 66 words → 116 words (75.8% increase)
- While 86.4% of Riven's work was incorporated, copied material constitutes only 49.1% of EchoCraft's final work
- Ratio shows copying limited to what was necessary while adding substantial critical commentary

#### 5. Responding to "Could Have Written New Song" Argument

##### a. Fair Use Doesn't Require Total Rewrite

- Fair use explicitly permits copying for criticism
- Requiring new composition would nullify criticism exception
- Cannot correct *this* song's inaccuracies by writing different song
- [RESEARCH NEEDED: Cases rejecting "could have created original work" argument]

##### b. Identity of Original Is Essential to Critical Purpose

- Point is to challenge *Riven's specific claims*
- Public recognizes traditional narrative—EchoCraft responds to that tradition
- Writing entirely different song would lose rhetorical force

**Factor 3 Conclusion:** Copying was reasonable and necessary for critical purpose; much of copied content is factual; substantial new content added. Factor 3 weighs in favor of fair use, or at worst is neutral when viewed in context of transformative purpose.

---

### E. FACTOR FOUR: EFFECT ON POTENTIAL MARKET (CRITICAL—ANTICIPATE APPELLANT'S STRONGEST ARGUMENT)

**Opening Thesis:** Factor 4 strongly favors fair use because Appellant had no established market, only speculative preliminary discussions, and any market loss stems from consumer preference for a superior educational work, not impermissible substitution.

#### 1. Legal Framework: "Potential Market" Definition

##### a. Distinguishing "Potential" from "Speculative"

- Fair use protects traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets
- But not purely speculative markets
- **KEY FINDING:** *Castle Rock Entertainment v. Carol Pub. Group*, 150 F.3d 132, 146 (2d Cir. 1998): Factor 4 focuses on "traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets" not speculative opportunities
- Inquiry: Whether "creators of original works would in general develop or license others to develop" particular markets
- *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168, 181 (2d Cir. 2016): Requires "regular" requests that are "frequently" granted—not isolated discussions
- Courts must assess "impact on potential licensing revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets" NOT just "possible lost licensing fees from defendants' challenged use" which "would always favor copyright owner"

##### b. Burden on Copyright Holder

- Plaintiff must show cognizable market harm
- Mere speculation insufficient
- **FINDING:** *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 163: "Burden of proving that secondary use does not compete in relevant market is borne by party asserting [fair use] defense"
- BUT preliminary negotiations alone insufficient—must show established licensing pattern
- *TCA Television*: Plaintiffs successfully demonstrated market by alleging they receive "regular" requests to license which they "frequently" grant, plus allegations defendants' use "negatively affected commercial market for future licensing"
- Single preliminary discussion ≠ established market pattern

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- What evidence suffices to show "regular" and "frequently granted" licensing requests?
- Cases where single or few preliminary negotiations held insufficient for market harm
- Does preliminary discussion create presumption of potential market, or must plaintiff show pattern?

#### 2. No Established Market Existed Here

##### a. Facts Demonstrating Lack of Market

- Only one potential customer (Toobin/Columbia Grammar)
- No signed contract (Record p.__)
- No agreed-upon per-song price
- No finalized budget (August finalization date)
- $500 was "preliminary negotiation fee," not licensing payment
- "We'll talk more soon" = ongoing discussion, not agreement (Exhibit I)

##### b. Single Preliminary Negotiation ≠ Market

- Cannot extrapolate market from one preliminary discussion
- Schools haven't shown interest in licensing Riven's song
- No evidence of established licensing practice for educational songs
- **FINDING:** *TCA Television* distinguishes between cognizable licensing markets and speculation by requiring ESTABLISHED PATTERNS not isolated licensing discussions
- *Castle Rock*: Cannot claim protection for "purely speculative licensing opportunities"
- *American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.*, 60 F.3d 913 (2d Cir. 1994): "By definition every fair use involves some loss of royalty revenue because secondary user has not paid royalties"—must avoid automatically favoring copyright holders

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- Cases rejecting market harm based on single preliminary negotiation
- What constitutes "regular" and "frequent" licensing to establish market?
- Educational materials licensing cases—when does pattern emerge?

#### 3. Market Superiority vs. Market Substitution

##### a. Legal Distinction

- Fair use permits better transformative work to compete with original
- Market harm must be from substitution, not superiority
- If consumers prefer transformative work because it's better/more accurate, that's legitimate competition
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** *U.S. v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers*, 599 F.Supp.2d 415, 426 (S.D.N.Y. 2009): Courts must examine SOURCE of harm
- Harm from transformative use that "lowered public's estimation of original (such as devastating review of book that quotes liberally from original to show how silly and poorly written it is)" = FAIR USE "notwithstanding the harm"
- VS. harm where "secondary use, by copying the first, offers itself as market substitute" = argues AGAINST fair use
- *Authors Guild v. Google*, 804 F.3d 202 (2d Cir. 2015): "Authors who write for educational purposes...would lose ability to earn revenues if users permitted to copy materials freely merely because copying was in service of nonprofit educational mission"
- BUT educational purpose alone insufficient—must be genuinely transformative

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- Cases applying ASCAP source-of-harm framework in educational contexts
- How do courts distinguish consumer choice for accuracy vs. free substitution?
- When does criticism-based market loss constitute legitimate competition?

##### b. Causation Analysis: Why Did Toobin Choose EchoCraft?

- Toobin testimony: EchoCraft version "solicits critical discussion" (Record p.__)
- Choice based on educational superiority, not mere duplication
- Historical accuracy matters in educational market
- Schools *should* prefer accurate over inaccurate materials
- **FINDING:** *Hachette* rejected complex econometric causation analysis: "We routinely rely on logical inferences where appropriate in assessing fourth fair use factor"
- Courts use logical inference, not complex empirical data, to assess market harm
- BUT inference must be based on substitution, not superiority

##### c. Policy Argument

- Denying fair use would allow inaccurate works to monopolize market
- Copyright doesn't protect market share for inferior or inaccurate works
- Transformative works allowed to compete even in same market
- *ASCAP*: Criticism-based market loss is legitimate competition

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- How do courts analyze causation when multiple factors affect market?
- Cases where consumer testimony about reasons for choice affected market analysis
- Does educational superiority alone justify market displacement?

#### 4. Responding to Appellant's Market Harm Evidence

##### a. Toobin Termination

- **Appellant's claim:** Direct evidence—Toobin literally chose EchoCraft over Riven
- **Response:** Choice reflects preference for better product, not substitution effect
  - Toobin valued critical thinking pedagogy
  - EchoCraft work serves different educational purpose
  - *Warhol* doesn't require transformative works to avoid all market competition

##### b. Revenue Improvement for Parent Company

- **Appellant's claim:** EchoCraft's revenue improved after release (-5% to +2%)
- **Response:**
  - Correlation ≠ causation
  - Multiple business factors affect revenue
  - Song licensed below cost—no direct profit
  - Incidental PR benefit doesn't create market harm to Riven
  - **FINDING:** *Hachette* on correlation vs. causation: "Just because one event follows another doesn't mean it was caused by prior event"
  - Court noted "broad range of factors at play" and rejected econometric analysis failing to account for multiple variables
  - *Hachette*: Nonprofit "obtains only those nonmonetary benefits that attend most other legitimate, secondary uses, including advancing its mission and bolstering its reputation"

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- Cases analyzing temporal correlation vs. actual causation in market harm
- When do incidental benefits to related entities trigger commerciality finding?
- Revenue attribution analysis in fair use cases

##### c. Lost Licensing Opportunities at Other Schools

- **Appellant's claim:** Other schools would have licensed Riven's song
- **Response:**
  - Pure speculation—no evidence of other interested schools
  - No established licensing market existed
  - Schools have right to choose educational materials based on quality/accuracy

#### 5. Derivative Market Argument

##### a. Anticipating Appellant's Licensing Market Claim

- Appellant may argue: potential licensing market for educational use of song
- Response: Transformative uses don't harm derivative markets
- *Campbell*: Transformative works create their own market space
- **FINDING:** *Castle Rock*: Court protects copyright holders' "artistic decision not to saturate those markets with variations of their original"
- Derivative markets are "traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed" markets copyright owners "would in general develop or license others to develop"
- BUT transformative criticism creates separate market space, not derivative market

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- When does transformative use create new market vs. usurp derivative market?
- 2d Cir. cases on educational licensing as derivative vs. transformative market
- Does correction/criticism qualify as derivative work or separate category?

##### b. No Traditional Licensing Practice

- Riven never licensed song before
- No established practice of licensing educational songs
- Cannot retroactively create "market" after infringement alleged

#### 6. Holistic Factor 4 Analysis

##### a. Lost Opportunity ≠ Market Harm

- Single preliminary negotiation insufficient to establish market
- Fair use would be meaningless if preliminary discussions always defeated it
- Transformative educational works must be permitted to compete

##### b. Public Interest Consideration

- Factor 4 considers harm to original work and public
- Public benefits from accurate educational materials
- Protecting Riven's "market" would harm students' access to accurate history

**Factor 4 Conclusion:** No established market harmed; loss due to superiority, not substitution; preliminary negotiations insufficient to establish cognizable market. Factor 4 weighs strongly in favor of fair use.

---

### F. HOLISTIC FAIR USE ANALYSIS

**Opening Thesis:** The four factors do not operate mechanically; viewed together and in context, they overwhelmingly support fair use.

#### 1. Factors Are Not Weighted Equally

- *Campbell*: Factor 1 (transformative purpose) is central inquiry
- Strong Factor 1 transformation can overcome other factors
- Factor 2 carries minimal weight per *Campbell*
- **FINDING:** Transformative purpose under Factor 1 is "central question" in analysis (*Hachette*)
- Strong transformation reduces significance of other factors including commercialism (*Campbell*)
- Factor 4 analysis depends heavily on Factor 1 transformation (*ASCAP*: transformative criticism harm is legitimate)

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- Post-Warhol 2d Cir. cases on factor weighting—has Warhol changed relative weights?
- Cases where strong Factor 1 overcame adverse Factors 2, 3, or 4
- Can Factor 4 (no market harm) overcome weak Factor 1 (low transformation)?

#### 2. Integration Across Factors

- Factor 1 transformation (critical educational purpose) explains Factor 3 copying (necessary for criticism)
- Factor 1 nonprofit educational purpose reduces Factor 4 market concerns
- Factors support and reinforce each other

#### 3. Purpose of Fair Use Doctrine

- Promote knowledge, education, criticism, commentary
- Balance copyright protection with public interest in information flow
- This case exemplifies fair use's core purpose: improving public discourse through critical commentary
- **FINDING:** *Campbell*: Fair use advances "interests sought to be promoted by copyright law" including criticism, comment, and teaching
- *Rubin*: Scholarly works "further goals of copyright laws by adding value to prior intellectual labor"
- Copyright Constitutional purpose: "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" (Art. I, § 8, cl. 8)

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases discussing Constitutional purpose in educational fair use
- How does public interest in accurate education factor into holistic analysis?
- Cases balancing copyright incentives against access to accurate information

#### 4. Respondent's Holistic Synthesis

- Strong transformation (Factor 1) + reasonable copying for critical purpose (Factor 3) + no established market harm (Factor 4) = paradigmatic fair use
- Factor 2's slight weight against fair use is overwhelmed by other factors
- Public interest reinforces fair use finding

### G. SUMMARY JUDGMENT WAS PROPER

**Opening Thesis:** The district court properly granted summary judgment because no genuine dispute of material fact precluded fair use determination as matter of law.

#### 1. Fair Use as Legal Question

- Transformativeness = legal characterization of facts, not factual question
- Market harm = legal conclusion about market effect
- **FINDING:** Fair use determination is legal question reviewed de novo when based on undisputed facts
- "Is this transformative?" = legal characterization, not fact-finding
- Competing inferences from undisputed facts don't create genuine factual dispute for trial

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. cases granting summary judgment on fair use where parties disputed transformativeness
- When do factual disputes (vs. legal characterization disputes) preclude summary judgment?
- Post-Warhol summary judgment standards—has anything changed?

#### 2. No Material Factual Disputes

- Facts undisputed: song lyrics, licensing terms, Toobin negotiations
- Disputes are about legal characterization, not underlying facts
- "Is use transformative?" = legal question
- "Did market harm occur?" = legal conclusion from undisputed facts

#### 3. Standards for Summary Judgment on Fair Use

- Summary judgment appropriate when reasonable minds could not differ
- Here: transformation clear, copying necessary, no established market
- **FINDING:** Summary judgment appropriate when fair use can be decided as matter of law based on undisputed facts
- Legal characterization disputes (transformativeness, market effect) don't preclude summary judgment
- No genuine factual dispute when facts undisputed and only legal conclusions differ

**NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- 2d Cir. fair use summary judgment grants—what fact patterns support decision as matter of law?
- Cases denying summary judgment on fair use—what factual disputes required trial?
- Burden at summary judgment stage for fair use defense

## IV. ANTICIPATED COUNTER-ARGUMENTS & RESPONSES

### Counter-Argument 1: "Minimal Transformation"

**Appellant's Claim:**

- Simply adding question mark and few lines isn't transformative
- 87.5% copying shows lack of transformation
- Could have written entirely new song

**Our Response:**

- Transformation measured by change in purpose/message, not percentage of new content
- Question format + corrected facts + new lines = fundamentally different purpose
- "Conjure up" principle permits substantial copying when necessary for criticism
- [CASES NEEDED: Transformative uses with <50% new content]

---

### Counter-Argument 2: "Commercial Exploitation Disguised as Education"

**Appellant's Claim:**

- EchoCraft used song to boost parent company's image and revenue
- Nonprofit division is sham
- PR benefits and revenue improvement show commercial purpose
- Bad press (recycling, hazing) motivated release—not educational mission

**Our Response:**

- Primary purpose test: Look to actual distribution mechanism and pricing
- Nonprofit division = actual legal entity, below-cost licensing = actual practice
- Incidental benefits don't defeat primary educational purpose
- Compare universities: Publish educational materials that enhance reputation, still nonprofit
- *Campbell* rejects binary commercial/nonprofit distinction
- [CASES NEEDED: Incidental commercial benefits not defeating educational fair use]

---

### Counter-Argument 3: "Excessive, Unnecessary Copying"

**Appellant's Claim:**

- 86.4% of original work copied (57 of 66 words) is per se excessive
- Could have conveyed same historical information without copying lyrics
- Only changed one word ("no" → "some" secrets) plus minor modifications
- Fair use requires minimizing copying

**Our Response:**

- Reasonableness, not minimization, is standard
- Purpose was to criticize *Riven's specific claims*—requires reproducing them
- Cannot say "that's wrong" without showing what "that" is
- *Campbell*: May take "the heart" when necessary for critical purpose
- While 86.4% of original incorporated, copied words comprise only 49.1% of final work
- Added 59 new words (nearly equal to original's 66 words)—demonstrates substantial restraint and original contribution
- Final work is 75.8% longer than original (116 vs. 66 words), showing extensive critical commentary
- [CASES NEEDED: High-percentage copying approved for educational criticism]

---

### Counter-Argument 4: "Direct Market Substitution"

**Appellant's Claim:**

- Toobin literally chose EchoCraft's version instead of Riven's—paradigmatic substitution
- Lost $500 preliminary fee and future song opportunities
- Other schools now won't license Riven's version
- Revenue loss is concrete, not speculative

**Our Response:**

- Substitution vs. superiority: Toobin chose better educational tool
- No contract existed—preliminary negotiations don't establish market
- Schools have right to choose based on accuracy and pedagogical merit
- Lost opportunity from consumer choice ≠ actionable market harm under Factor 4
- Cannot monopolize market for inaccurate educational materials
- [CASES NEEDED: Superiority-based consumer choice not constituting market harm]

---

### Counter-Argument 5: "Factual Disputes Preclude Summary Judgment"

**Appellant's Claim:**

- Whether use is transformative is factual question for jury
- Market harm evidence conflicts (Toobin chose EchoCraft; revenue improved)
- District court improperly weighed evidence rather than identifying genuine disputes
- Should have gone to trial

**Our Response:**

- Fair use determination is legal question based on undisputed facts
- "Is this transformative?" = legal characterization, not fact-finding
- Competing inferences from undisputed facts don't create genuine factual dispute
- Summary judgment appropriate when no reasonable jury could find for non-movant
- Here: Transformation is clear as matter of law
- [CASES NEEDED: 2d Cir. granting summary judgment on fair use despite competing evidence]

## VII. WRITING STRATEGY & STRUCTURE

### A. Lead with Strength

- Open argument with Factor 1 transformativeness (strongest point)
- Emphasize critical educational purpose throughout
- Use "criticism, comment, teaching" statutory language prominently

### B. Acknowledge Weaknesses Proactively

- Don't hide 87.5% copying—address it directly in Factor 3
- Admit Factor 2 weighs against us but explain *Campbell*'s minimization
- Acknowledge revenue improvement but explain incidental nature

### C. Factual Narrative

- Tell compelling story: Riven's song contained historical inaccuracies → EchoCraft corrected them → Public benefits from accurate education
- Emphasize question mark in title—physical manifestation of critical inquiry
- Highlight Toobin's testimony about "critical discussion"

### D. Policy Arguments

- Public interest in historically accurate educational materials
- Fair use must permit correction of inaccuracies
- Cannot allow copyright to insulate false claims from criticism
- Market should reward educational quality and accuracy

### E. Tone

- Respectful but forceful
- Confident in strength of fair use defense
- Avoid dismissiveness toward Riven's creative work—acknowledge then distinguish

## VIII. QUESTIONS FOR INSTRUCTOR/TEACHING FELLOW

1. Should we address Title VII retaliation claim at all, or solely focus on fair use?

   - [ANSWER: Focus solely on fair use—Issue 2 only]
2. How much detail on summary judgment standards vs. merits of fair use?

   - [Likely: Brief standard discussion, focus primarily on four factors]
3. Should we include policy arguments beyond doctrinal analysis?

   - [Likely: Yes, but grounded in fair use purposes]
4. Priority: More research on Factor 4 market harm cases or Factor 1 post-*Warhol* educational use?

   - [Likely: Both critical—Factor 4 is Appellant's strength]
5. Format: Roman numerals for main headings or full sentence point headings?

   - [Check sample briefs in Handbook]

---

## IX. NEXT STEPS & TIMELINE

### Immediate (This Week):

1. **Complete priority research**:

   - Post-*Warhol* Second Circuit educational fair use cases
   - Market harm—preliminary negotiations insufficient to establish market
   - High-percentage copying cases (Factor 3)
   - Summary judgment standards for fair use
2. **Verify all Record citations**: Page numbers, exact quotes, context
3. **Review sample briefs** in Handbook for formatting and style

### Following Week:

4. **Draft Factor 1 section** (strongest argument—perfect this first)
5. **Draft Factor 4 section** (anticipate Appellant's strongest argument)
6. **Outline counter-arguments** with specific case-based responses

### Subsequent Drafts:

7. **Complete Factors 2 & 3** sections
8. **Holistic analysis** section
9. **Introduction/Summary of Argument** (write last, after mastering all arguments)
10. **Questions Presented** (refine after drafting argument)

---

## X. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH LOG

### Completed Research:

- Fair Use Research Tracker created with targeted research questions
- Downloaded cases: Authors Guild v. Google, Vega v. Hempstead
- Reviewed Record, case description, fact patterns
- Analyzed Campbell, Warhol basics from law school courses

### Priority Research Gaps:

1. **POST-WARHOL 2D CIRCUIT**: Educational fair use applications
2. **FACTOR 4 MARKET**: Preliminary negotiations = speculative vs. potential market
3. **FACTOR 3 COPYING**: Educational/critical contexts approving high percentages
4. **SUMMARY JUDGMENT**: When fair use can be decided as matter of law
5. **EDUCATIONAL CRITICISM**: Substantive correction as "criticism" under § 107

### Research Strategy:

- Start with Second Circuit cases (binding authority)
- Work backward from recent cases citing *Warhol*
- Look for educational contexts (songs, textbooks, teaching materials)
- Find cases with similar factual patterns (high copying percentage, preliminary negotiations)

---

## XI. THEMATIC THREADS TO WEAVE THROUGHOUT

### Central Narrative:

"This case asks whether fair use protects transformative educational criticism that corrects historical inaccuracies. It does."

### Supporting Themes:

1. **Criticism & Commentary**: Statutory fair use categories explicitly include criticism—that's precisely what EchoCraft did
2. **Educational Purpose**: Nonprofit educational distribution at below-cost pricing demonstrates genuine educational mission
3. **Historical Accuracy**: Public interest in correcting inaccuracies in educational materials
4. **Necessary Copying**: Cannot criticize specific claims without reproducing them
5. **No Established Market**: Single preliminary discussion ≠ cognizable market under Factor 4
6. **Consumer Choice**: Market preference for superior educational work is legitimate competition

---

## CONCLUSION

This outline provides the framework for a comprehensive appellee brief defending the district court's summary judgment finding of fair use. The argument structure prioritizes our strongest points (transformative critical purpose, no established market) while proactively addressing weaknesses (high percentage copying, incidental commercial benefits).

The four factors, viewed holistically, support fair use: strong transformation under Factor 1, reasonable necessary copying under Factor 3, and no cognizable market harm under Factor 4, with Factor 2's slight adverse weight insufficient to overcome the other factors' support for fair use.

**Central Message**: EchoCraft's song represents paradigmatic fair use—transformative educational criticism that corrects factual inaccuracies and promotes critical thinking about historical narratives. The district court properly granted summary judgment, and this Court should affirm.
