2nd Circuit

### **Summary** 

Under Factor 4 of the fair use analysis in the Second Circuit,
preliminary negotiations without signed contracts, agreed prices, or
finalized budgets do **not** suffice to establish cognizable market
harm. The Second Circuit requires evidence of \"traditional, reasonable,
or likely-to-be-developed markets\" rather than speculative licensing
opportunities [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group,
Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a)
[TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
A single preliminary negotiation is insufficient; courts require
evidence of established licensing patterns, such as \"regular\" requests
that are \"frequently\" granted, to distinguish potential markets from
speculation [TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
Copyright holders need not show concrete development plans or executed
contracts, but must demonstrate markets that copyright owners \"would in
general develop or license others to develop\" based on industry
standards [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group, Inc.,
150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).

### **Definition of \"Potential Market\" Under Factor 4** 

The Second Circuit has established that Factor 4 analysis focuses on
\"traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets\" rather
than speculative opportunities [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol
Pub. Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a)
[TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
In *Castle Rock Entertainment v. Carol Publishing Group*, the court
emphasized that the inquiry centers on whether \"creators of original
works would in general develop or license others to develop\" particular
markets, not whether the specific plaintiff has concrete plans for
market exploitation [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub.
Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
This standard protects copyright holders\' \"artistic decision not to
saturate those markets with variations of their original\" while
preventing defendants from usurping natural derivative market
opportunities [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group,
Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).

The court rejected arguments that copyright owners must demonstrate
actual market development or specific commercial interest. As the
*Castle Rock* court explained, \"It would not serve the ends of the
Copyright Act---i.e., to advance the arts---if artists were denied their
monopoly over derivative versions of their creative works merely because
they made the artistic decision not to saturate those markets with
variations of their original\" [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol
Pub. Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).

### **Evidentiary Standards for Licensing Markets** 

The Second Circuit has clarified that preliminary negotiations alone
cannot establish market harm under Factor 4. In *TCA Television Corp. v.
McCollum*, the court distinguished between cognizable licensing markets
and speculation by requiring evidence of established patterns rather
than isolated licensing discussions [TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum,
839 F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
The plaintiffs successfully demonstrated market harm by alleging they
receive \"regular\" requests to license their copyrighted work, which
they \"frequently\" grant, combined with allegations that defendants\'
unlicensed use \"negatively affected the commercial market for future
licensing\" [TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).

This standard prevents the automatic finding of market harm that would
occur if courts focused solely on \"possible lost licensing fees from
defendants\' challenged use\" [TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839
F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
The court noted that such an approach \"would always favor copyright
owner if courts focused on loss of potential licensing fees from alleged
infringer\" [TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
Instead, courts must assess \"impact on potential licensing revenues for
traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets\" [TCA
Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).

### **Distinguishing Speculation from Potential Markets** 

The Second Circuit has established clear boundaries between legally
cognizable potential markets and mere speculation. Courts do not require
concrete evidence of agreed prices, finalized budgets, or executed
contracts [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group, Inc.,
150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
However, they do require more than hypothetical licensing opportunities.
The *American Geophysical Union v. Texaco* decision, cited approvingly
by subsequent Second Circuit cases, warned that \"by definition every
fair use involves some loss of royalty revenue because the secondary
user has not paid royalties,\" making it crucial to avoid automatically
favoring copyright holders based on unpaid licensing fees [American
Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I1a0f72148b9811d99a6fdc806bf1638e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).

The analysis must consider whether \"unrestricted and widespread conduct
of the sort engaged in by the defendant would result in a substantially
adverse impact on the potential market for the original\" [Castle Rock
Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
This forward-looking inquiry protects established markets while
preventing copyright holders from claiming protection for purely
speculative licensing opportunities.

### **Market Substitution Analysis** 

The Second Circuit\'s approach emphasizes market substitution rather
than market suppression. In *Castle Rock*, the court explained that
\"the concern is not whether the secondary use suppresses or even
destroys the market for the original work or its potential derivatives,
but whether the secondary use usurps or substitutes for the market of
the original work\" [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub.
Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).
This analysis particularly applies when the secondary work \"pays homage
to\" rather than criticizes the original, as such works are more likely
to substitute for natural licensing opportunities [Castle Rock
Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).

### **Commentary on This Question** 

The fourth fair use factor under 17 U.S.C. § 107 concerns the effect of
the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
Courts recognize only harm tied to "market substitution"---where the
secondary use replaces demand for the original---as legally cognizable
market harm. Speculative or purely theoretical licensing markets without
evidence of plausible, traditional, or likely to be developed markets
generally do not satisfy this burden. It is insufficient for a plaintiff
merely to assert that it might license the use; instead, a plaintiff
must show a genuine interest in exploiting the market or that it would
license the use but refuses to do so to increase value. Courts
distinguish "potential market" from "speculative market" by looking at
actual negotiations, licensing history, or an intent to enter such
markets, rather than unformed or hypothetical possibilities. Moreover,
licensing attempts that fail to materialize do not automatically show
harm, as failed negotiations alone do not grant the right to exclude and
prove market displacement. Widespread or unrestricted conduct
threatening a plausible market can weigh against fair use, while
isolated preliminary negotiations without finalized agreements, prices,
or budgets typically constitute insufficient evidence of a
non-speculative potential market[PATRYFAIR §
6:9](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/If62e583576c911de98e6b24a7ac3e71f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a),
[PATRYFAIR §
6:10](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/If62e583876c911de98e6b24a7ac3e71f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=0aa8f077-2144-4c3f-b2b7-46b2d0842c2a).

A single preliminary negotiation, absent more concrete steps toward
market exploitation, rarely establishes market harm. Courts in the
Second Circuit emphasize that the fourth factor involves balancing the
actual or likely adverse market consequences against the public benefit
of the use, assessing harm both to existing and derivative markets.
Successful licensing models evidencing tangible revenue streams support
plausible potential markets, while mere plaintiff assertions without
documentary or transactional evidence remain insufficient. Lost
licensing revenues must relate to reasonable and traditional markets
copyright owners exploit; otherwise, acknowledging every licensing
opportunity would render fair use analyses circular and unworkable.
Thus, "potential market" requires demonstrable economic significance,
not mere theoretical or aspirational negotiations[PATRYFAIR §

Research Steps

- Researching the definition and scope of \"potential market\" under
  Factor 4 of the fair use analysis in 2nd Circuit copyright law,
  focusing on foundational cases like Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v.
  Nation Enterprises and subsequent circuit precedent.

  - Found 2nd Circuit defines \"potential market\" as \"traditional,
    reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets\" per Castle Rock and
    other cases. Key cases: Hachette Book Group, Castle Rock, American
    Geophysical Union establish framework.

- Analyzing 2nd Circuit case law addressing whether preliminary
  negotiations, expressions of interest, or early-stage licensing
  discussions without signed contracts constitute cognizable harm to
  potential markets under 17 U.S.C. § 107(4).

  - TCA Television shows preliminary negotiations alone insufficient -
    requires \"regular\" licensing requests that are \"frequently\"
    granted to establish traditional market. Single licensing
    negotiation inadequate.

- Examining 2nd Circuit precedent on the evidentiary standards required
  to establish market harm in Factor 4 analysis, specifically whether
  concrete evidence of agreed prices, finalized budgets, or executed
  contracts is necessary versus speculative or potential licensing
  opportunities.

  - Castle Rock establishes no concrete contracts/prices needed - uses
    \"would in general develop or license\" standard. American
    Geophysical Union warns against automatic licensing fee harm but
    allows \"traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed
    markets.\"

- Reviewing 2nd Circuit decisions distinguishing between theoretical
  future markets and legally cognizable potential markets for Factor 4
  purposes, including analysis of market speculation versus demonstrable
  licensing prospects.

  - Based on Castle Rock and TCA Television analysis: 2nd Circuit
    distinguishes cognizable markets from speculation by requiring
    evidence of established licensing patterns (\"regular\" requests
    \"frequently\" granted) rather than single preliminary negotiations.
    Theoretical markets rejected unless they meet \"traditional,
    reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed\" standard.

Questions for further research

1.  **What specific type of copyrighted work is involved in your
    analysis (literary work, musical composition, visual art, etc.)?**

2.  **When you refer to \"preliminary negotiations,\" are you describing
    formal licensing discussions, informal expressions of interest, or
    actual contract negotiations that did not reach completion?**

3.  **Has the copyright holder previously granted licenses for similar
    uses of this work or comparable works in their portfolio?**

4.  **What specific evidence exists of the copyright holder\'s past
    licensing practices or stated intentions regarding licensing this
    particular work?**

5.  **Are there any documented requests from third parties seeking to
    license this work or similar works from the same copyright holder?**
