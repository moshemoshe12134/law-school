Research question

In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 4 (market
harm), when determining the \"relevant market\" for purposes of
assessing market harm, is the relevant market (a) the plaintiff\'s
potential licensing market, or (b) the educational materials market
generally?\
\
**Sub-questions:**\
\
- Under fair use Factor 4 in educational copyright cases, how do courts
define \"the market\" for purposes of analyzing potential market
harm---is it the specific licensing market, the broader educational
market, or both?\
- In copyright fair use Factor 4 analysis, does a transformative use
create a different market segment such that there is no overlap with the
original work\'s market?\
- Under fair use Factor 4\'s market harm analysis, can a defendant\'s
use be found to harm a licensing market if no established licensing
market existed at the time of the alleged infringement?\
- Does transformative use create different market segment?\
- Can defendant\'s use harm licensing market if no established licensing
market existed?

2nd Circuit

### **Summary** 

In the Second Circuit, the relevant market for Factor 4 market harm
analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 is neither strictly limited to the
plaintiff\'s specific licensing market nor broadly defined as the
general educational materials market. Instead, courts apply a nuanced
standard focusing on \"traditional, reasonable, or likely to be
developed markets\" that copyright holders would \"in general develop or
license others to develop.\" [American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.,

The analysis encompasses both the primary market for the original work
and derivative markets, but excludes transformative markets that
copyright owners cannot legitimately claim. [17 USCA

### **Second Circuit\'s \"Traditional, Reasonable, or Likely to be Developed Markets\" Standard** 

The Second Circuit established the foundational framework in *American
Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.*, holding that \"only an impact on
potential licensing revenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to
be developed markets should be legally cognizable\" under Factor 4.
[American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I1a0f72148b9811d99a6fdc806bf1638e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
This standard prevents copyright holders from automatically defeating
fair use claims merely because a secondary user did not pay licensing
fees, while still protecting legitimate licensing markets.

The court emphasized that market harm analysis must avoid circular
reasoning where \"the copyright holder has not been paid a fee to permit
that particular use.\" [American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60
F.3d 913
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I1a0f72148b9811d99a6fdc806bf1638e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
Instead, courts examine whether the challenged use impacts markets that
creators of original works would generally develop or license others to
develop, regardless of whether the specific plaintiff has actually
entered those markets. [American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60
F.3d 913
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I1a0f72148b9811d99a6fdc806bf1638e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
[Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)

### **Application in Educational Contexts** 

The recent Second Circuit decision in *Hachette Book Group, Inc. v.
Internet Archive* demonstrates how this standard applies in educational
settings. [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
The court rejected the argument that the relevant market should be
narrowly defined and instead held that \"the relevant market for
purposes of the fourth factor was the market for books in general,
regardless of format.\" [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive,
115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)

Significantly, the court found that the publishers\' \"library ebook
licensing market was both reasonable and developed,\" even though the
defendant argued it was providing a different educational service.
[Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
The court emphasized that the Internet Archive \"appropriated the Works
without payment of customary licensing fees\" and thereby \"usurped a
market that properly belongs to the copyright holder.\" [Hachette Book
Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)

### **Transformative Use Creates Different Market Segments** 

The Second Circuit recognizes that transformative uses can create
separate market segments that do not overlap with the original work\'s
market. In *Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group*,
the court explained that \"the more transformative the secondary use,
the less likelihood that the secondary use substitutes for the
original.\" [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Pub. Group, Inc.,
150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
However, the analysis focuses on \"whether the secondary use usurps or
substitutes for the market of the original work\" rather than whether it
suppresses or destroys that market. [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v.
Carol Pub. Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)

Critically, *Castle Rock* established that \"copyright owners may not
preempt exploitation of transformative markets\" by developing licensing
for \"parody, news reporting, educational or other transformative uses
of its own creative work.\" [Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol
Pub. Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib818c772944b11d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
This prevents copyright holders from expanding their licensing reach
into markets that should remain available for fair use.

### **Licensing Markets and Established Markets** 

Regarding whether defendants can harm non-existent licensing markets,
Second Circuit precedent indicates that courts will recognize potential
licensing revenues only for markets that are \"traditional, reasonable,
or likely to be developed.\" [American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.,
60 F.3d 913
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I1a0f72148b9811d99a6fdc806bf1638e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
[TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168
(2016)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5f460680901011e69981dc2250b07c82/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
In *Hachette*, the district court noted that rightsholders bear \"only
some initial burden of identifying relevant markets\" and need not
\"show actual market harm.\" [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet
Archive, 664 F.Supp.3d 370
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I009e24f0ca9711ed8833ddef8168f00b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)

The court in *Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd.* clarified
that \"the fact that a copyright holder has previously secured licenses
does not make a given market \'traditional, reasonable, or likely to be
developed\'\" if the use is transformative. [Bill Graham Archives, LLC.
v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 386 F.Supp.2d 324
(2005)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I8eb0976fc3f211d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
This prevents copyright holders from claiming ownership over
transformative markets simply by attempting to license such uses.

### **Burden of Proof and Market Identification** 

Under Second Circuit precedent, plaintiffs must identify relevant
traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets, but
defendants bear the burden to demonstrate lack of market harm once those
markets are identified. [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive,
664 F.Supp.3d 370
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I009e24f0ca9711ed8833ddef8168f00b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)
Courts examine whether \"widespread adoption of the secondary use\"
would cause substantial harm to licensing revenues, applying a
\"substantial economic harm\" standard rather than requiring proof of
actual lost sales. [Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I918674d4743311e5a807ad48145ed9f1/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=e8741ffb-1af3-4394-a74b-223c21c42107)

### **Commentary on This Question** 

The relevant market for the fourth fair use factor typically focuses on
the plaintiff's potential licensing market rather than a broad market
encompassing all educational materials. Courts require evidence that
this licensing market is traditional, reasonable, or likely to be
developed; mere theoretical potential markets are insufficient. The
Second Circuit holds the market includes potential derivative uses
creators would generally exploit or license. Transformative uses
typically do not serve as market substitutes and thus do not cause
cognizable market harm under the fourth factor, as such uses create
different market segments with distinct expressive purposes.
Nonetheless, transformative uses can still harm derivative markets if
they are widespread and reveal significant portions that compete with or
usurp licensing opportunities for the original work. The burden
initially lies with the copyright holder to identify the relevant
market, particularly licensing markets. If established, the defendant
must then show lack of market harm. Where no established licensing
market exists, courts may weigh this factor in favor of the defendant,
but absence of market harm alone does not guarantee a finding of fair
use. Thus, market harm relates primarily to established licensing
markets, factoring whether the secondary use acts as a substitute or
impacts reasonable potential markets for derivative uses [PATRYCOPY §

  before the 985 Superbowl in a 2016 documentary about the team\'s
  entire year, the court acknowledged that the copyright owner could
  license clips but still, and correctly, weighed the fourth factor in
  defendant\'s favor:\[12\]In this case, the plaintiffs do not argue
  that '85: The Greatest Team in Football History affected the market
  for full recordings, whether they be audio or audiovisual, of the
  Super Bowl

  \...In the context of the fourth statutory fair use factor under
  copyright law, the effect of the secondary use upon the potential
  market for the value of the copyrighted work, the market for potential
  derivative uses includes only those that creators of original works
  would in general develop or license others to develop. 17 U.S.C.A. §

  \...News outlet\'s use of copyright owner\'s video of starving polar
  bear in online article about video\'s popularity without first
  obtaining license, if widespread, would harm the licensing market for
  video, and therefore factor of effect of use on the market weighed
  against finding outlet\'s fair use of video; widespread adoption of
  outlet\'s use could overtake market for video and owner had licensed
  video to almost two dozen entities in the United States and around the
  world. 17 U.S.C.A. § 107. Nicklen v. Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.,

  \...The HathiTrust decision also states, "The only market harms that
  count are the ones that are caused because the secondary use serves as
  a substitute for the original, not when the secondary use is
  transformative ...." 755 F.3 d at 99. This, too, is incorrect, and led
  to concerns that the term "transformative" had swallowed up the right
  to prepare derivative works. A movie that copied a material part of a
  novel would not be a market substitute for the novel, but it surely
  would harm, if not kill, the novelist\'s ability to license for such a

  A Practice Note that provides guidance on defining a relevant market
  for claims brought under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. This
  Practice Note explains why market definition is a critical and often
  dispositive element in antitrust cases, as it is required to evaluate
  whether a defendant has market or monopoly power. It outlines the core
  components of market definition, covering both the relevant product
  market and the relevant geographic market. It also details key legal
  concepts courts use to determine the relevant market, such as

Research Steps

- Analyzing the statutory language of 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 4 regarding
  \"effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
  copyrighted work\" to determine textual guidance on market definition.

  - 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 4 examines \"effect of the use upon the
    potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\" Statutory
    text establishes broad framework examining economic impact on
    multiple potential markets, requiring courts to distinguish between
    cognizable and non-cognizable harms.

- Researching Second Circuit precedent interpreting the scope of
  \"potential market\" under Factor 4, specifically examining whether
  courts focus on the plaintiff\'s actual licensing practices or broader
  market categories.

  - 2nd Circuit focuses on \"traditional, reasonable, or likely to be
    developed markets\" (American Geophysical Union). Market harm
    analysis considers licensing markets that copyright holders would
    \"in general develop or license others to develop\" rather than just
    plaintiff\'s actual practices.

- Examining Second Circuit cases involving educational fair use claims
  to determine how courts define the relevant market when educational
  materials are involved in the alleged infringement.

  - In Hachette v. Internet Archive (2024), 2nd Circuit held relevant
    market was \"market for books in general, regardless of format\" and
    found library ebook licensing market was both \"reasonable and
    developed\" supporting market harm finding in educational context.

- Analyzing Second Circuit decisions addressing the distinction between
  harm to a plaintiff\'s existing licensing market versus harm to
  broader market segments or potential future markets under Factor 4.

  - 2nd Circuit distinguishes between market substitution vs. market
    destruction. Castle Rock: \"concern is not whether the secondary use
    suppresses or even destroys the market for the original work or its
    potential derivatives, but whether the secondary use usurps or
    substitutes for the market.\" Transformative uses may harm markets
    but harm from criticism/parody is not cognizable under Copyright
    Act.

- Researching Second Circuit guidance on whether market harm analysis
  should consider hypothetical licensing markets that the plaintiff has
  not yet entered or developed.

  - 2nd Circuit allows consideration of licensing markets not yet
    developed by plaintiff if they are \"traditional, reasonable, or
    likely to be developed markets\" (American Geophysical Union).
    However, copyright owners \"may not preempt exploitation of
    transformative markets\" by developing licensing for \"parody, news
    reporting, educational or other transformative uses\" (Castle Rock).

Questions for further research

1.  **What specific type of educational use is involved in your case
    (classroom instruction, research, online course materials, library
    reserves, etc.)?**

2.  **When you refer to \"educational materials market,\" are you asking
    about K-12 textbooks, higher education materials, professional
    training resources, or some other specific category?**

3.  **Has the copyright holder actually licensed their work to
    educational institutions or educational content providers in the
    past?**

4.  **What is the specific nature of the allegedly infringing use
    (copying for classroom distribution, digital course packs, online
    streaming, excerpt compilation, etc.)?**

5.  **Does the defendant claim their use is transformative in purpose or
    function compared to the original work\'s intended use?**
