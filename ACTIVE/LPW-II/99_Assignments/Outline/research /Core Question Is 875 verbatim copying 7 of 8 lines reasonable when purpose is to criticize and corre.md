**Sub-questions:**\
\
- What percentage copying has Second Circuit approved for educational
criticism?\

context?\
- How do courts distinguish necessary copying from excessive copying for
criticism?

2nd Circuit

### **Summary** 

87.5% verbatim copying (7 of 8 lines) for purposes of criticism and
correction presents a challenging fair use analysis in the Second
Circuit. While the Second Circuit has approved substantial copying for
criticism, the highest percentage explicitly approved was only 4.3% in
[Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 F.2d 1253
(1986)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I808bb4b994d311d9a707f4371c9c34f0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
However, Second Circuit precedent establishes that there are no absolute
percentage rules, and courts must conduct both quantitative and
qualitative analyses under the fragmented literal similarity test. The
critical factors are whether the copying serves a transformative
critical purpose with \"critical bearing\" on the original work, whether
the copied material constitutes the \"heart\" of the original, and
whether the amount copied is necessary to achieve the critical purpose.

### **Second Circuit\'s Approach to Percentage Copying for Educational Criticism** 

The Second Circuit explicitly rejected bright-line percentage rules for
fair use copying. In *Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, the court stated
that \"there are no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work
may be copied and still be considered a fair use\" and noted that \"in
some instances, copying a work wholesale has been held to be fair
use\...while in other cases taking only a tiny portion of the original
work has been held unfair\" [Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 F.2d 1253
(1986)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I808bb4b994d311d9a707f4371c9c34f0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
The court approved 4.3% copying of interview transcripts for critical
commentary about abortion, emphasizing that both quantitative and
qualitative assessments matter in the analysis.

The Second Circuit applies a fragmented literal similarity test when
defendants copy verbatim portions of original works. This test focuses
on whether the copied elements are \"trivial or substantial\" to the
plaintiff\'s work, considering both their \"qualitative and quantitative
significance\" [TufAmerica, Inc. v. Diamond, 968 F.Supp.2d 588
(2013)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I65ab25061b5211e3b0499ca71fc6ba70/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
In *TufAmerica, Inc. v. Diamond*, the court explained that fragmented
literal similarity \"exists where the defendant copies a portion of the
plaintiff\'s work exactly or nearly exactly, without appropriating the
work\'s overall essence or structure\" [TufAmerica, Inc. v. Diamond, 968
F.Supp.2d 588
(2013)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I65ab25061b5211e3b0499ca71fc6ba70/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).

### **Campbell\'s Conjure Up Standard Beyond Parody** 

The Supreme Court\'s decision in *Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith*
clarified that Campbell\'s conjure up standard extends beyond parody to
other forms of criticism and commentary. The Court stated that \"other
commentary or criticism that targets an original work may have
compelling reason to \'conjure up\' the original by borrowing from it\"
[Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S.
508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
However, this protection comes with important limitations.

The Court established that when \"commentary has no critical bearing on
the substance or style of the original composition\...the claim to
fairness in borrowing from another\'s work diminishes accordingly (if it
does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its
commerciality, loom larger\" [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual
Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
Commentary that targets broader social issues without specifically
critiquing the original work receives diminished protection and \"can
stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act
of borrowing\" [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v.
Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).

### **Distinguishing Necessary from Excessive Copying for Criticism** 

The Second Circuit recognizes a strong presumption favoring criticism
and commentary under the first fair use factor. The court has held that
\"there is a strong presumption that factor one favors the defendant if
the allegedly infringing work fits the description of uses described in
section 107,\" including criticism and comment [In re DMCA Section
512(h) Subpoena to YouTube (Google, Inc.), 581 F.Supp.3d 509
(2022)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I407c3a00791511ec9c73d7682396ea1c/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
In *Authors Guild v. Google*, the Second Circuit noted that \"among the
best recognized justifications for copying from another\'s work under
the transformative purpose factor of fair use is to provide comment on
it or criticism of it\" [Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I918674d4743311e5a807ad48145ed9f1/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).

However, courts carefully scrutinize whether the amount of copying is
necessary to achieve the critical purpose. In *Penguin Random House LLC
v. Colting*, the court found that defendants\' copying was not necessary
to serve a transformative purpose because \"nearly all of infringers\'
books were devoted to telling copyrighted stories, with only two pages
purporting to analyze stories\" [Penguin Random House LLC v. Colting,
270 F.Supp.3d 736
(2017)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I190c8ed0970a11e792fdd763512bbe26/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
The court emphasized that copying was \"not necessary to serve a
transformative purpose, like providing commentary or criticism\"
[Penguin Random House LLC v. Colting, 270 F.Supp.3d 736
(2017)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I190c8ed0970a11e792fdd763512bbe26/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).

The key inquiry is whether the defendant took the \"heart\" of the
original work. In *Maxtone-Graham*, the court found no infringement
partly because the defendant could not be said to have \"took the heart
of Pregnant by Mistake, since Maxtone-Graham\'s book consists of
narratives by 17 women, and has no identifiable core that could be
appropriated\" [Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 F.2d 1253
(1986)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I808bb4b994d311d9a707f4371c9c34f0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
This contrasts with cases like *Harper & Row*, where \"the Nation took
what was essentially the heart of the book\" [Maxtone-Graham v.
Burtchaell, 803 F.2d 1253
(1986)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I808bb4b994d311d9a707f4371c9c34f0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).

### **Application to 87.5% Copying Scenario** 

For 87.5% verbatim copying to constitute fair use for criticism and
correction, several factors would be crucial. First, the criticism must
have \"critical bearing\" on the original work itself, not merely use it
to comment on broader topics [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual
Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
Second, the copied portions should not constitute the \"heart\" or most
important elements of the original work [Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell,
803 F.2d 1253
(1986)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I808bb4b994d311d9a707f4371c9c34f0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
Third, the extensive copying must be necessary to achieve the critical
purpose - courts will scrutinize whether less copying could accomplish
the same educational or critical goals [Penguin Random House LLC v.
Colting, 270 F.Supp.3d 736
(2017)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I190c8ed0970a11e792fdd763512bbe26/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).

The Second Circuit\'s emphasis on qualitative analysis means that even
high percentage copying might be permissible if the copied material
represents less significant portions of the original work and serves a
genuine critical purpose targeting the accuracy or substance of the
specific copied passages [TufAmerica, Inc. v. Diamond, 968 F.Supp.2d 588
(2013)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I65ab25061b5211e3b0499ca71fc6ba70/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).

### **Commentary on This Question** 

The Second Circuit and Supreme Court jurisprudence emphasize the
transformative use doctrine as a central but nuanced element in fair use
analysis. Transformative use requires that a secondary work add
something new with a further purpose or different character, thereby not
merely superseding the original. The key inquiry is whether the new use
changes the meaning, message, or purpose sufficiently, recognized as
transformative, to support fair use, especially in criticism or
commentary contexts. The Campbell decision established parody as a
paradigmatic transformative use wherein verbatim copying may be
necessary for critique, although the Supreme Court in Andy Warhol
Foundation v. Goldsmith refined this by emphasizing that mere addition
of new expression, meaning, or message does not automatically favor fair
use if the secondary use shares the original's purpose. Fair use
"requires an analysis of the specific 'use'" and the justification for
copying, limiting fair use to uses that "target an original work" and
compellingly "conjure up" the original to achieve their critique or
commentary [COPYLAW §
15:37](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib8c26518719e11da9907dfbe13053825/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).

Regarding verbatim copying, the Second Circuit has not fixed a precise
permissible percentage but suggests reasonableness depends on purpose
and market effect. Entire works or substantial verbatim copying may be
justified when necessary for the transformative purpose, especially in
educational, research, or critical contexts, provided no market harm or
substitution occurs [PATRYCOPY §
10:143](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I2b3a07fa9f1311db9d6ac2f94b704450/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326).
The amount copied must be reasonable relative to the critic's purpose;
excessive copying unrelated to criticism risks outweighing fair use. The
"conjure up" standard from Campbell and refined in Warhol applies beyond
parody but sets a high bar for copying justification in criticism and
correction to prevent encroachment upon the copyright owner's derivative
rights [COPYLAW §
15:37](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib8c26518719e11da9907dfbe13053825/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=60319574-b224-4c65-8425-fcdce1bf7326),

  distinction between parody and satire, it did not hold that satire was
  ineligible for fair use treatment; it only held that, in some
  circumstances, satire would require a greater justification for the
  borrowing.\[15\] In particular, the Campbell court indicated that
  "looser forms of parody" and "satire" would pass muster in
  circumstances "when there is little or no risk of market substitution,
  whether because of the large extent of transformation of the earlier

  \...A much-cited discussion of the issue is Judge Leval\'s in Authors
  Guild v. Google Inc.\[22\] Following the approach taken in HathiTrust,
  Judge Leval wrote:The third statutory factor instructs us to consider
  "the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
  copyrighted work as a whole." The clear implication of the third
  factor is that a finding of fair use is more likely when small
  amounts, or less important passages, are copied than when the copying
  is extensive, or encompasses the most important parts of the original.

Research Steps

- Researching the fair use analysis framework under 17 U.S.C. § 107 as
  applied by the Second Circuit, focusing on the four statutory factors
  and their application to criticism and commentary.

  - Found 17 USC § 107 framework - four factors: purpose/character,
    nature of work, amount/substantiality, market effect. Second Circuit
    applies these factors case-by-case without bright-line rules.

- Examining Second Circuit precedent on the amount and substantiality
  factor in fair use cases involving high percentages of verbatim
  copying for critical commentary purposes.

  - Maxtone-Graham: 2nd Circuit approved 4.3% copying for criticism.
    Court emphasized no absolute rules - both quantitative and
    qualitative analysis required. Key: didn\'t take \"heart\" of work.

- Analyzing Second Circuit case law on transformative use doctrine when
  copying serves to criticize, correct, or comment upon the original
  work\'s inaccuracies.

  - Campbell\'s \"conjure up\" standard applies beyond parody to
    criticism/commentary that targets the original work. Requires
    \"critical bearing\" on original work itself. Commentary without
    critical bearing on original receives diminished protection.

- Investigating Second Circuit holdings on the purpose and character
  factor under fair use when defendants copy substantial portions
  specifically to identify and correct errors in the original work.

  - Found extensive Second Circuit case law on \"fragmented literal
    similarity\" test for substantial copying. Key cases: TufAmerica,
    May v. Sony, Penguin Random House. Courts apply quantitative AND
    qualitative analysis - copying must be both sufficient in amount and
    qualitatively significant to original work. Strong presumption
    favors criticism/comment under factor one.

Questions for further research

1.  **What is the total length of the original work from which the 7 of
    8 lines were copied?**

2.  **What specific inaccuracies or errors in those particular 7 lines
    are you seeking to criticize and correct?**

3.  **Does your criticism target the substance or style of the original
    8-line passage itself, or do you use these lines to comment on
    broader topics?**

4.  **Will your work include substantial original analysis and
    commentary beyond the copied material?**

5.  **What is the nature of the original work (academic paper, creative
    writing, journalism, etc.)?**
