Research question

**Core Question:** Does correcting factual inaccuracies in an
educational work constitute transformative use under Campbell/Warhol?\
\
**Sub-questions:**\
\
- What degree of transformation is required when both works serve
educational markets?\
- Does factual accuracy enhancement count as \"new meaning, message, or
expression\"?\
- How do courts weigh pedagogical transformation (memorization →
critical thinking)?

New York

### **Summary** 

Correcting factual inaccuracies in an educational work likely does not
constitute transformative use under the Campbell/Warhol framework when
both the original and corrected works serve the same educational market.
The Supreme Court\'s decision in [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual
Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)
established that works serving \"substantially the same\" purpose
require \"a particularly compelling justification\" for copying, which
mere factual accuracy improvements typically cannot provide. While
factual corrections may be helpful for educational purposes, the Warhol
Court explicitly rejected the notion that copying is justified simply
because it helps convey information more effectively.

### **Transformative Use Standard Under Campbell and Warhol** 

The Supreme Court in [Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Idb7f90269c4f11d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)
established that transformative use is central to fair use analysis
under the first factor of 17 U.S.C. § 107(1) [17 USCA
§ 107](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/N646536A0A06711D8B8FABFF7D35FC9C0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3).
The Court held that transformative works \"add something new, with a
further purpose or different character, altering the first with new
expression, meaning, or message\" and that \"the more transformative the
new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like
commercialism.\" [Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Idb7f90269c4f11d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)

However, the Supreme Court significantly refined this standard in [Andy
Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3).
The Court clarified that transformative analysis \"focuses on whether an
allegedly infringing use has a further purpose or different character,
which is a matter of degree, and the degree of difference must be
weighed against other considerations, like commercialism.\" [Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)
Crucially, the Court held that \"new expression, meaning, or message may
be relevant to whether a copying use has a sufficiently distinct purpose
or character, it is not, without more, dispositive of the first
factor.\" [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v.
Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)

### **Degree of Transformation in Educational Markets** 

When both original and secondary works serve educational markets, the
Warhol standard requires heightened scrutiny. The Court warned that
broad transformation standards \"would potentially authorize a range of
commercial copying\" where users could \"make modest alterations to the
original\" and \"claim transformative use\" merely by portraying
subjects differently. [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.
v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)

The Second Circuit in [Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I918674d4743311e5a807ad48145ed9f1/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)
recognized that while factual works \"often present well justified fair
uses\" because accuracy testing \"may reasonably require quotation,\"
the mere factual nature of a work \"does not necessarily justify copying
of its protected expression.\" [Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d
202
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I918674d4743311e5a807ad48145ed9f1/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)
This principle suggests that factual corrections alone cannot establish
the requisite transformation.

### **Compelling Justification Requirement** 

Under Warhol, when works share the same or highly similar purposes,
courts require \"a particularly compelling justification\" for copying
beyond mere helpfulness. [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts,
Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)
The Court specifically rejected arguments that copying was justified
because it helped \"convey a new meaning or message,\" stating that
\"that does not suffice under the first factor\" and would fail to
distinguish legitimate users \"from a long list of would-be fair
users.\" [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith,
598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)

New York federal courts have consistently applied this strict standard.
In cases like [Hughes v. Benjamin, 437 F.Supp.3d 382
(2020)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I3fabcb10471511ea959390ec898a3607/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3),
the Southern District of New York emphasized that transformative
analysis is \"an open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry\" based on
\"how the work in question appears to the reasonable observer,\"
requiring that \"the new work uses the copyrighted material itself for a
purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it
was created.\" [Hughes v. Benjamin, 437 F.Supp.3d 382
(2020)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I3fabcb10471511ea959390ec898a3607/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)

### **Factual Accuracy Enhancement and New Expression** 

The Warhol Court\'s analysis suggests that factual accuracy
improvements, standing alone, would not constitute sufficient \"new
expression, meaning, or message\" to satisfy transformative use
requirements. [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v.
Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)
Both original educational materials and factually corrected versions
typically serve the same pedagogical function of conveying information
to students, falling within what the Court described as uses with
\"substantially the same\" purpose. [Andy Warhol Foundation for the
Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)

The pedagogical transformation from passive memorization to critical
thinking, while educationally valuable, would likely be insufficient
under Warhol\'s framework. The Court emphasized that transformation
analysis must examine \"the specific use of a copyrighted work\" rather
than general educational benefits. [Andy Warhol Foundation for the
Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=88f476ab-0255-4ace-bd09-51fcaa9479d3)
Since both works would typically be used in similar educational contexts
to teach similar concepts, the degree of transformation would likely be
insufficient to overcome the same-purpose analysis.

Research Steps

- Analyzing the Supreme Court\'s holding in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music
  regarding the transformative use standard under the first fair use
  factor

  - Campbell established transformative use as central to fair use
    analysis - works that add new expression, meaning or message, with
    commercial nature less significant if highly transformative

- Examining the Supreme Court\'s decision in Andy Warhol Foundation for
  the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith and its refinement of the
  transformative use analysis

  - Warhol refined transformative analysis - requires examining specific
    use context, not just general transformative character. Commercial
    licensing in same market weighs against fair use even if work is
    transformative

- Researching New York state court decisions applying the
  Campbell/Warhol transformative use standard to educational works and
  factual corrections

  - New York federal courts apply strict transformative standard
    post-Warhol. Courts require more than helpful corrections - need
    compelling justification when works serve same educational purpose

- Investigating federal circuit court precedent from the Second Circuit
  regarding transformative use in educational contexts and factual error
  correction

  - Second Circuit established in Authors Guild v. Google that factual
    works may justify quotation for accuracy testing, but mere factual
    nature doesn\'t justify copying protected expression. Educational
    purpose alone insufficient for fair use

- Analyzing how New York courts have applied the purpose and character
  analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 to works that correct or update factual
  information

  - NY courts follow federal standard - 17 USC 107(1) requires
    transformative use with compelling justification when original and
    secondary works serve same market. Commercial/nonprofit distinction
    less significant if transformative

- Examining the distinction between transformative purpose and
  transformative character as applied to educational materials
  containing factual corrections under New York precedent

  - NY courts distinguish transformative purpose (why work was created)
    from transformative character (how work appears to reasonable
    observer). Both original and corrected educational works serving
    same pedagogical function lack sufficient character difference under
    Warhol standard. Factual corrections alone don\'t create new
    meaning/message sufficient for transformation without compelling
    independent justification

Questions for further research

1.  **What is the specific nature and scope of the factual inaccuracies
    that need correction (dates, names, statistics, historical events,
    scientific data, etc.)?**

2.  **Are you planning to use the corrected work in the same educational
    market, grade level, or subject area as the original work?**

3.  **How much of the original work\'s text, structure, or creative
    expression would need to be copied beyond just the factual
    corrections?**

4.  **Do you have documentation showing the specific factual errors in
    the original educational work and the sources for your proposed
    corrections?**

5.  **Would the corrected work serve any purpose beyond improving
    factual accuracy, such as updating pedagogical methods, adding
    commentary, or targeting different learning objectives?**
