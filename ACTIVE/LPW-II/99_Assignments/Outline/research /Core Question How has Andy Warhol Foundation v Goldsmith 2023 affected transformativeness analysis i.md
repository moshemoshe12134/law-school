Research question

**Core Question:** How has Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith (2023)
affected transformativeness analysis in Second Circuit, particularly for
same-market uses?\
\
**Sub-questions:**\
\
- Does Warhol require heightened showing of transformation when
defendant competes in same market?\
- How does Warhol\'s \"purpose and character\" focus affect educational
fair use claims?\
- Has Second Circuit issued post-Warhol decisions clarifying educational
use standards?

Based on your question, this response is focused on 2nd Circuit, not the
original selection of New York.

### **Summary** 

Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith (2023) [Andy Warhol Foundation for
the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
has fundamentally altered transformativeness analysis in the Second
Circuit by requiring heightened justification for same-market commercial
uses and creating a presumption against fair use when original and
secondary works share the same or similar purposes. The decision does
not require a heightened showing of transformation when defendants
compete in the same market, but rather establishes that same-market
commercial uses are presumptively unfair absent compelling justification
for copying. For educational fair use claims, the Warhol framework
significantly limits the protective value of educational purpose when
the underlying use serves the same purpose as the original work. The
Second Circuit has strictly applied this framework in post-Warhol
decisions, rejecting fair use claims even for nonprofit educational uses
when the fundamental purpose remains unchanged.

### **Warhol\'s Fundamental Changes to Transformativeness Analysis** 

The Supreme Court in [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.
v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
rejected the broad \"new expression\" test that had previously favored
fair use findings. The Court held that \"the first fair use factor
instead focuses on whether an allegedly infringing use has a further
purpose or different character, which is a matter of degree, and the
degree of difference must be weighed against other considerations, like
commercialism.\" [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v.
Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
The Court emphasized that new expression, meaning, or message \"is not,
without more, dispositive of the first factor\" because otherwise
\"transformative use would swallow the copyright owner\'s exclusive
right to prepare derivative works.\" [Andy Warhol Foundation for the
Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)

Most significantly for same-market analysis, the Court established that
\"if an original work and secondary use share the same or highly similar
purposes, and the secondary use is commercial, the first fair use factor
is likely to weigh against fair use, absent some other justification for
copying.\" [Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v.
Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
This creates a strong presumption against fair use in same-market
commercial scenarios, fundamentally shifting the burden to defendants to
demonstrate compelling justification for their copying.

### **Second Circuit Application to Same-Market Commercial Uses** 

The Second Circuit has rigorously applied Warhol\'s framework to reject
fair use claims in same-market scenarios. In [Hachette Book Group, Inc.
v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5),
the court found that the Internet Archive\'s digital lending program was
not transformative despite its educational mission because \"the
underlying purpose of making the Works available in a derivative format
is still the same.\" [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115
F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
The court concluded that creating \"digital copies of the Works and
distributes these copies to its users in full, for free\" without
providing \"criticism, commentary, or information about the originals\"
failed the transformativeness test. [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v.
Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)

Similarly, in [Graham v. Prince, Not Reported in Fed. Supp.
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I84996da0f09e11ed91a6d631469a59e7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5),
decided shortly after Warhol, a district court within the Second Circuit
applied the new framework to deny fair use protection for commercial art
sales, finding that even after extensive discovery, the defendant
\"cannot show that the first factor favors a finding of fair use\"
because the use was \"not transformative as a matter of law.\" [Graham
v. Prince, Not Reported in Fed. Supp.
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I84996da0f09e11ed91a6d631469a59e7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
The court noted that \"the fair use precedents of Google and Warhol
support and reinforce this conclusion.\" [Graham v. Prince, Not Reported
in Fed. Supp.
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I84996da0f09e11ed91a6d631469a59e7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)

### **Impact on Educational Fair Use Claims** 

Warhol significantly constrains educational fair use claims by limiting
the protective value of educational purpose when the underlying use
serves the same fundamental purpose as the original. The Second Circuit
in [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
acknowledged that \"commerciality of a secondary use of a copyrighted
work is only one part of the inquiry into the first factor\" and that
\"the mere fact that a use is educational and not for profit does not
insulate the use from a finding of infringement.\" [Hachette Book Group,
Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)

However, the circuit has not completely abandoned educational fair use.
In [Wilder v. Hoiland, Not Reported in Fed. Supp.
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ibf2d4110c1a611eea589aad7d6c39ed3/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5),
a district court found fair use for an academic presentation that used
copyrighted curriculum materials, emphasizing that the defendant\'s
\"purpose thus was educational---to share the experience of the NICE and
NICHE programs with an audience of community college professors\" and
was \"transformative rather than a \'usurping\' infringement of the
original work.\" [Wilder v. Hoiland, Not Reported in Fed. Supp.
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ibf2d4110c1a611eea589aad7d6c39ed3/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
The court found that \"both the audience and the nature of Hoiland\'s
use were different than Wilder\'s original use and purpose.\" [Wilder v.
Hoiland, Not Reported in Fed. Supp.
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ibf2d4110c1a611eea589aad7d6c39ed3/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)

### **Post-Warhol Standards and Market Analysis** 

The Second Circuit continues to recognize transformativeness as the
\"central question\" in first factor analysis [Hachette Book Group, Inc.
v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5),
but now applies heightened scrutiny when works serve similar commercial
purposes. In [Santos v. Kimmel, 154 F.4th 30
(2025)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic2fd9410a2c911f0b891c23825f37a33/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5),
the circuit found fair use for a late-night television show\'s use of
celebrity videos because the use was genuinely transformative commentary
with \"a further purpose or different character.\" [Santos v. Kimmel,
154 F.4th 30
(2025)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic2fd9410a2c911f0b891c23825f37a33/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)
The court emphasized that transformativeness analysis \"turns on what a
reasonable observer thinks, not subjective intent of copyright holder or
that of secondary user.\" [Santos v. Kimmel, 154 F.4th 30
(2025)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic2fd9410a2c911f0b891c23825f37a33/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)

The circuit\'s approach reflects Warhol\'s emphasis on use-specific
analysis rather than broad categorical determinations. Courts now
examine whether the specific challenged use serves the same commercial
function as the original, with commercial licensing markets receiving
particular protection. As the Court noted in Warhol, the challenged use
must be evaluated based on \"the specific \'use\' of a copyrighted work
that is alleged to be \'an infringement\'\" because \"the same copying
may be fair when used for one purpose but not another.\" [Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508
(2023)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ifd67b741f54e11ed93738d5a07d4dec7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=78a44bf6-62e0-4809-8729-9e8db731e4d5)

Research Steps

- Analyzing the Supreme Court\'s holding in Andy Warhol Foundation for
  the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith (2023) regarding transformativeness
  analysis and purpose/character factors under the first fair use factor

  - Warhol fundamentally changed transformativeness analysis: rejected
    broad \"new expression\" test, requires heightened justification for
    same-market commercial uses, emphasizes use-specific analysis, and
    creates presumption against fair use when original and secondary
    works share same/similar purposes and secondary use is commercial

- Examining how the Supreme Court\'s emphasis on commercial use and
  market substitution in Warhol affects transformativeness
  determinations when original and allegedly infringing works target the
  same market

  - Warhol creates presumption against fair use when original and
    secondary works share same/similar purposes and secondary use is
    commercial. Second Circuit applies this strictly - Hachette Book
    Group (2024) rejected transformative claims for same-purpose uses
    even when educational/nonprofit

- Researching Second Circuit decisions citing Andy Warhol Foundation v.
  Goldsmith since May 2023 to identify how the circuit has interpreted
  and applied the Supreme Court\'s modified transformativeness framework

  - Key Second Circuit post-Warhol cases: Hachette Book Group v.
    Internet Archive (2024) - strictly applied Warhol framework,
    rejected transformative use for library digitization; Santos v.
    Kimmel (2024/2025) - found transformative use for commentary;
    Wilder v. Hoiland (2024/2025) - educational use can still be fair
    even without strong transformativeness

- Identifying changes in Second Circuit fair use analysis post-Warhol,
  particularly regarding the weight given to transformative purpose
  versus commercial nature and market harm in same-market scenarios

  - Post-Warhol: transformativeness remains central inquiry but with
    heightened scrutiny for same-market uses. Educational purpose still
    weighs in favor but insufficient alone if underlying purpose same as
    original. Commercial nature weighs more heavily against fair use in
    same-market scenarios

- Analyzing Second Circuit cases addressing fair use claims involving
  works that serve similar commercial purposes or target identical
  markets following the Warhol decision

  - Second Circuit applies Warhol strictly to same-market uses: Hachette
    Book Group rejected fair use for library digitization despite
    nonprofit/educational purpose because underlying purpose remained
    same; Graham v. Prince (2023) denied fair use for commercial art
    sales in same market; Santos v. Kimmel succeeded only because use
    was transformative commentary with different purpose

Questions for further research

1.  **Are you analyzing a specific case involving educational use of
    copyrighted materials, or seeking general guidance on post-Warhol
    fair use standards?**

2.  **Does the educational use you\'re evaluating involve the same
    target audience and fundamental purpose as the original copyrighted
    work?**

3.  **Is the educational use being made by a commercial entity or
    for-profit institution, or by a genuine nonprofit educational
    organization?**

4.  **When you refer to \"same-market uses,\" are you specifically
    concerned with commercial licensing markets or broader competitive
    markets?**

5.  **Are there specific facts about the transformative nature of the
    educational use that might distinguish it from merely providing the
    same content in a different format?**
