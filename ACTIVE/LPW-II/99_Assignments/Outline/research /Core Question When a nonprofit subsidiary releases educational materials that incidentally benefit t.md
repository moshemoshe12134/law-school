Based on your question, this response is focused on 2nd Circuit, not the
original selection of New York.

### **Summary** 

Under 2nd Circuit precedent, a nonprofit subsidiary releasing
educational materials that incidentally benefit the parent company\'s
reputation or revenue does not automatically defeat nonprofit
educational characterization for Factor 1 analysis. The controlling
standard focuses on whether the organization exploits copyrighted
material \"without paying the customary price\" and whether the
educational purpose remains substantial rather than merely incidental

General reputational and mission-advancement benefits inherent to
legitimate nonprofit activities do not constitute commercial use, and
licensing educational materials at or below cost supports rather than
undermines educational characterization [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v.

### **The 2nd Circuit\'s Commercial Use Framework** 

The Second Circuit in *Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive*
established the key framework for analyzing when nonprofit activities
constitute commercial use under Factor 1. The court held that \"the crux
of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of
the use is monetary gain, but whether the user stands to profit from
exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary
price\" [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).
This standard focuses on direct economic exploitation rather than
incidental benefits.

Critically, the court distinguished between illegitimate commercial
benefits and legitimate nonprofit activities, reasoning that a nonprofit
\"does not stand to gain the direct reputational benefits that accompany
presenting another\'s work as one\'s own. Rather, it obtains only those
nonmonetary benefits that attend most other legitimate, secondary uses,
including advancing its mission and bolstering its reputation\"
[Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).
The court emphasized that \"characterizing these general benefits as
commercial profits would render commercial the activities of virtually
any nonprofit organization that bolsters its reputation through its own
nonprofit activities\" [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive,
115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).

### **Primary Purpose vs. Incidental Benefits Test** 

The legal framework distinguishes between an organization\'s primary
purpose and incidental commercial effects. In *Lish v. Harper\'s
Magazine Foundation*, even though the publisher was a nonprofit
foundation operating at a loss, the court found commercial use because
\"Harper\'s objective is to sell magazines at a profit\" [Lish v.
Harper\'s Magazine Foundation, 807 F.Supp. 1090
(1992)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I8a81928255fb11d997e0acd5cbb90d3f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).
However, this analysis focuses on the organization\'s primary objective
rather than secondary effects.

Federal tax law provides additional guidance through the Mayo Clinic
litigation, where courts established that \"primary purpose\" means an
organization must have education as a \"substantial\" rather than
\"principal or most important\" purpose [Mayo Clinic v. United States,
145 F.4th 877
(2025)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I08fde630699b11f082eac55a77a98193/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).
An organization can have multiple substantial functions while
maintaining educational characterization if non-educational activities
remain \"merely incidental\" to the educational mission [Mayo Clinic v.
United States, 145 F.4th 877
(2025)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I08fde630699b11f082eac55a77a98193/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919),
[Mayo Clinic v. United States, 642 F.Supp.3d 831
(2022)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I79894e106ae511ed90b98e711441bfca/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).

### **Licensing Below Cost as Protective Factor** 

The practice of licensing educational materials at or below cost serves
as a protective factor supporting educational characterization. Revenue
Ruling 71-529 established that organizations providing services
\"substantially below cost\" can qualify for tax-exempt status under
Section 501(c)(3) [Nonprofits\' Ins. Alliance of California v. U.S., 32
Fed.Cl. 277
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Iebd7e4b7562a11d9bf30d7fdf51b6bd4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).
The Federal Claims Court in *Nonprofits\' Insurance Alliance of
California v. United States* confirmed that \"the fact an organization
conducts a trade or business with an apparently commercial character as
its sole activity weighs heavily against exemption,\" but organizations
providing services below cost are distinguishable from purely commercial
entities [Nonprofits\' Ins. Alliance of California v. U.S., 32 Fed.Cl.
277
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Iebd7e4b7562a11d9bf30d7fdf51b6bd4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).

### **Application to Subsidiary-Parent Relationships** 

The 2nd Circuit\'s analysis in *Twin Peaks Productions, Inc. v.
Publications International, Ltd.* acknowledged that \"most publishers of
traditional \'educational\' works hope to make a profit, and in many
cases, including this one, publishers of traditional \'commercial\' work
have at least the pretense and often the reality of enlightening the
public\" [Twin Peaks Productions, Inc. v. Publications Intern., Ltd.,
996 F.2d 1366
(1993)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I1ffc022796fa11d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).
This recognition that educational and commercial elements can coexist
supports the principle that subsidiary operations serving legitimate
educational purposes do not lose protection merely because they
incidentally benefit a parent company.

The key inquiry remains whether the subsidiary\'s activities are
\"operated for the primary purpose of carrying on a trade or business
which would be an unrelated trade or business if regularly carried on by
the parent organization\" [HCSC-Laundry v. U. S., 450 U.S. 1
(1981)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Id4c909f39c1d11d991d0cc6b54f12d4d/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).
If the subsidiary\'s educational activities are integral to the
parent\'s exempt purposes and conducted at or below cost, incidental
reputational or revenue benefits to the parent do not defeat educational
characterization.

### **Administrative Decisions and Guidance** 

An organization with an additional commercial purpose must establish
that the commercial purpose is not primary but merely incidental to its
exempt educational purpose. The primary purpose test involves examining
whether the organization engages in profit-generating activities using
commercial methods and whether the business purpose predominates over
the educational one. Even if educational materials are disseminated,
charging fees that produce profit and conducting business in a manner
typical of commercial enterprises suggests that the educational purpose
is not primary. Secondary benefits that further a significant purpose
beyond the exempt educational purpose cannot be deemed incidental,
particularly if they advance commercial interests or yield substantial
private benefit [IRS PLR PLR
200523024](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I6a11d3e32e5611dbbffafa490ee528f6/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).

The incidental benefit doctrine requires benefits to a private party,
including a parent company, to be truly subordinate and inconsequential
to the exemption that the nonprofit seeks. Licensing educational content
at or below cost does not inherently shield an organization from a
commerciality finding if the overall commercial purpose dominates.
Courts scrutinize the full context, assessing both direct and indirect
benefits and the presence of commercial business methods to determine
the primary purpose. This approach underscores the necessity for
nonprofit subsidiaries to maintain the predominance of educational
objectives without allowing commercial or reputational advantages to
influence the characterization under Factor 1 [IRS PLR PLR
200523024](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I6a11d3e32e5611dbbffafa490ee528f6/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).

### **Commentary on This Question** 

The test for determining whether a nonprofit's primary purpose remains
educational rather than commercial under the Copyright Fair Use doctrine
and federal tax law focuses on whether the use is primarily for public
benefit or for the commercial interests of the user. The First Factor
under 17 U.S.C. § 107(1) includes analysis of transformative use as well
as the commercial or nonprofit nature of the use. Commercial use is not
determinative but can weigh against fair use when it exploits the
copyrighted work without paying the customary price. Notably, incidental
or indirect commercial or reputational benefit to a related commercial
entity does not alone negate nonprofit status if the nonprofit's use is
transformative and directed toward educational purposes. Licensing at or
below cost by the nonprofit subsidiary strongly indicates a
noncommercial purpose and can insulate against finding commerciality
[ARTARCHLAW §
7:79](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I16430786ff6d11d997fc8b27bc0692a9/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919).

For federal tax-exempt status under § 501(c)(3), the organization must
be operated exclusively or primarily for exempt purposes; more than an
insubstantial commercial activity or substantial private benefit can
defeat exempt status. The "exclusively" standard is interpreted as
"primarily." A nonprofit subsidiary whose educational materials
incidentally benefit its parent's reputation or revenue may pass if the
primary activities are educational and the commercial benefits are not
substantial. Charging at or below cost supports a charitable rather than
a commercial purpose. However, if the nonprofit's activities
substantially further private interests or compete with commercial
enterprises, its exempt status may be jeopardized [MERTENS §
34:7](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I30312f05835611df9ed28c892d71e76c/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=a60e3eec-3739-41b4-bdf2-f8bc37b54919),

### **Current Awareness** 

JD Supra reports that in Hachette Book Group Inc. v. Internet Archive,
Case No. 23-1260 (2d Cir. Sept. 4, 2024), the Second Circuit weighed the
first fair use factor and determined the use was noncommercial based on
nonprofit status and free distribution, finding that solicitation of
donations and association with platforms where users could purchase
books did not render the use commercial. This provides Second Circuit
guidance that incidental fundraising or commercial associations do not,
by themselves, defeat nonprofit educational characterization under
Factor 1 when the primary purpose is nonprofit dissemination, which is
relevant to evaluating nonprofit subsidiaries whose educational
materials may incidentally benefit a parent's reputation or revenue.

  \...Courts examine whether the copyrighted work was copied "in good
  faith to benefit the public or primarily for the commercial interests
  of the infringer."\[4\] Commercial use in the absence of
  transformation is a "factor that tends to weigh against a finding of
  fair use" because of the exploitation of the work without paying the
  price. The Supreme Court explained "'the crux of the profit/nonprofit
  distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain
  but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the
  copyrighted material\
  \
  **Supporting section 3 of 4**\
  \...Commerciality inquiries traditionally focused on economic
  incentives and remuneration, bottom-line motivations and monetary
  returns, such as the copier\'s profits, price disparities between the
  underlying work and the copied work, and other quantifiable
  factors.\[6\] Neither profit motive nor monetary gain, however,
  establishes commerciality. A per se concept is at odds with a
  malleable weighing of factors urged by the United States Supreme
  Court.\[7\] Conversely, nonprofit educational use is not converted
  into commercial use because the user makes\

  parsed by courts into transformative use as well as commercial or
  non-profit purposes, the latter which is not an either-or dichotomy,
  and the former which the Court has recalibrated by limiting scope of
  transformation and adjusting the timing of when it applies. Courts
  have made clear that the choice between first factor commercial and
  nonprofit uses is not bipolar. Commercial use is not dispositive.\[2\]
  The commercial nature is an additional element of use, not a

  \...One troublesome aspect of the term "exclusively" emerges when it
  is necessary to determine whether a particular trade or business is
  being carried on for an exempt purpose or whether it is devoted to a
  commercial enterprise. As interpreted by the Supreme Court,
  "exclusively ... plainly means that the presence of a single
  \[non-exempt\] purpose, if substantial in nature, will destroy the
  exemption regardless of the number or importance of truly \[exempt\]
  purposes."\[20\]\...\

Research Steps

- Researching the legal framework for Factor 1 analysis in nonprofit
  educational characterization under 2nd Circuit precedent and
  applicable federal tax law

  - Found 2nd Circuit precedent on Factor 1 analysis: Hachette v.
    Internet Archive (2024) - nonprofit status alone doesn\'t insulate
    from commerciality finding; Lish v. Harper\'s - nonprofit foundation
    still found commercial when objective was to sell magazines for
    profit

- Analyzing 2nd Circuit case law addressing when incidental commercial
  benefits to related entities affect nonprofit educational status
  determinations

  - 2nd Circuit in Hachette (2024) establishes that general
    reputational/mission benefits from nonprofit activities don\'t
    constitute commercial use - \"would render commercial the activities
    of virtually any nonprofit organization that bolsters its reputation
    through its own nonprofit activities\"

- Examining IRS regulations and Treasury guidance on educational
  purposes under IRC Section 501(c)(3) and how subsidiary-parent
  relationships impact educational characterization

  - Federal tax law: Mayo Clinic cases establish \"primary purpose\"
    means \"substantial\" not \"principal\" purpose - can have multiple
    substantial functions with incidental activities. Licensing at/below
    cost is factor supporting educational purpose (Rev. Rul. 71-529)

- Investigating 2nd Circuit decisions on the \"incidental benefit\"
  standard and its application to nonprofit subsidiaries whose
  activities may enhance parent company reputation or revenue

  - 2nd Circuit test: Focus is whether user profits from exploitation
    \"without paying customary price\" (Hachette). Incidental benefits
    that flow to parent don\'t defeat educational purpose if licensing
    done at/below cost and primary purpose remains educational

- Researching federal tax court and 2nd Circuit precedent distinguishing
  between primary educational purposes and secondary commercial effects
  in nonprofit subsidiary operations

  - 2nd Circuit precedent confirms nonprofit educational organizations
    can engage in some commercial-like activities without losing status
    if primary purpose remains educational. Twin Peaks (1993): even
    commercial publishers can serve educational purposes. Key is whether
    exploitation occurs \"without paying customary price\" and whether
    educational purpose is substantial rather than incidental.

Questions for further research

1.  **What specific educational materials does the nonprofit subsidiary
    produce and distribute (textbooks, research publications, training
    materials, etc.)?**

2.  **At what price point does the subsidiary license its educational
    materials to third parties, and how does this compare to market
    rates?**

3.  **What is the nature of the benefits that flow to the parent company
    (increased brand recognition, direct revenue sharing, enhanced
    market position, etc.)?**

4.  **What percentage of the subsidiary\'s activities are devoted to
    educational purposes versus other functions?**

5.  **Does the subsidiary have any formal agreements with the parent
    company regarding the use or licensing of educational materials?**
