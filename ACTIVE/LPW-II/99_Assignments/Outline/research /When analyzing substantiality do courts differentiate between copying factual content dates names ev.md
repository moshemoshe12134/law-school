Research question

When analyzing \"substantiality,\" do courts differentiate between
copying factual content (dates, names, events) vs. creative expression
(original phrasing, metaphors)?\
\
**Sub-questions:**\
\
- Are historical phrases like \"one if by land, two if by sea\"
protectable expression or factual content?\
- How do courts weigh copying of factual recitation vs. creative
arrangement?\
- Does educational context affect substantiality analysis of factual
copying?

2nd Circuit

### **Summary** 

In the Second Circuit, courts clearly differentiate between copying
factual content and creative expression when analyzing substantiality in
copyright infringement cases. Factual content including dates, names,
and events receives no copyright protection and cannot support
infringement claims. [Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone
Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340
(1991)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5df39b1a9c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
[Estate of Smith v. Cash Money Records, Inc., 253 F.Supp.3d 737
(2017)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I8ba0884045aa11e7b69fcb5ae0fb9a47/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
Only creative expression that meets minimal originality requirements is
protectable. Historical phrases like \"one if by land, two if by sea\"
would be unprotectable as historical facts or interpretations in the
public domain. [Leary v. Manstan, 118 F.Supp.3d 460
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I4a0e1f5c2ed111e590d4edf60ce7d742/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
Educational context affects fair use analysis but does not alter the
underlying copyrightability determination---facts remain unprotectable
regardless of educational purpose. [Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational
Corp. v. Crooks, 542 F.Supp. 1156
(1982)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I29d03151556811d997e0acd5cbb90d3f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

### **The Fact-Expression Dichotomy Framework** 

The Supreme Court in *Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*
established the fundamental principle that copyright protection applies
only to expression, not to ideas or facts. [Feist Publications, Inc. v.
Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340
(1991)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5df39b1a9c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
This fact-expression dichotomy requires courts to distinguish between
uncopyrightable facts and potentially copyrightable creative expression
in the selection, coordination, and arrangement of those facts. The
Court emphasized that \"the most fundamental axiom of copyright law is
that no author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates.\"
[Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S.
340
(1991)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5df39b1a9c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

The Second Circuit consistently applies this principle, recognizing that
\"it is a fundamental principle of copyright law that the similarity
between two works must concern the expression of ideas, not the ideas
themselves.\" [Edwards v. Raymond, 22 F.Supp.3d 293
(2014)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I90527c82e51711e3b4bafa136b480ad2/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
This dichotomy ensures that authors receive protection for their
original expression while encouraging others to build freely upon the
ideas and information conveyed by a work.

### **Protection for Factual Content** 

Courts provide no copyright protection for factual content. In *Estate
of Smith v. Cash Money Records*, the Southern District of New York held
that \"ordinary historical facts and events are not protectable elements
under the Copyright Act.\" [Estate of Smith v. Cash Money Records, Inc.,
253 F.Supp.3d 737
(2017)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I8ba0884045aa11e7b69fcb5ae0fb9a47/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
The court explained that only thin copyright protection exists for an
original selection or arrangement of facts, but the copyright is limited
to the particular selection or arrangement. [Estate of Smith v. Cash
Money Records, Inc., 253 F.Supp.3d 737
(2017)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I8ba0884045aa11e7b69fcb5ae0fb9a47/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

Similarly, in *Leary v. Manstan*, the District of Connecticut emphasized
that historical facts and events receive no protection, nor do
interpretations of historical events, such as theories, plots, or
explanatory hypotheses. [Leary v. Manstan, 118 F.Supp.3d 460
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I4a0e1f5c2ed111e590d4edf60ce7d742/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
The court noted that because retelling of history necessarily proceeds
in certain chronological order, an author cannot hold copyright in the
sequence of story elements. [Leary v. Manstan, 118 F.Supp.3d 460
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I4a0e1f5c2ed111e590d4edf60ce7d742/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

The Second Circuit has consistently held that news articles may contain
protectable expression, but the underlying news facts themselves remain
unprotectable. [Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc., 931
F.Supp.2d 537
(2013)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I7a71ca3c92c011e2a160cacff148223f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
As the court explained in *Fox News Network v. TVEyes*, \"the news
itself is not subject to copyright protection, but the creative
expression and artistic license necessarily exercised in deciding how to
portray, film, direct, stage, sequence, and communicate this information
is subject to copyright protection.\" [Fox News Network, LLC v. TVEyes,
Inc., 43 F.Supp.3d 379
(2014)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ibb154b91397111e4a795ac035416da91/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

### **Standards for Creative Expression** 

Creative expression receives copyright protection only if it meets
minimal originality requirements. The Supreme Court established in
*Feist* that originality requires independent creation plus at least
some minimal degree of creativity. [Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural
Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340
(1991)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5df39b1a9c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
However, not every selection, coordination, or arrangement passes this
test---the facts must be selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a
way as to render the work as a whole original. [Feist Publications, Inc.
v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340
(1991)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5df39b1a9c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

The Second Circuit applies this standard rigorously. In *Edwards v.
Raymond*, the Southern District of New York held that common phrases
like \"caught up\" are not eligible for copyright protection because
they lack originality and exist in the public domain. [Edwards v.
Raymond, 22 F.Supp.3d 293
(2014)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I90527c82e51711e3b4bafa136b480ad2/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
The court noted that only those components of a work that are original
to the author are eligible for copyright protection. [Edwards v.
Raymond, 22 F.Supp.3d 293
(2014)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I90527c82e51711e3b4bafa136b480ad2/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

For compilations, courts protect original selection and minimally
creative arrangement of preexisting materials. [Matthew Bender & Co.,
Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F.3d 674
(1998)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I8d950409947811d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
However, this protection remains thin---subsequent compilers remain free
to use the facts contained in another\'s publication so long as the
competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement.
[Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S.
340
(1991)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5df39b1a9c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

### **Application to Historical Phrases** 

Historical phrases like \"one if by land, two if by sea\" would be
unprotectable under Second Circuit precedent. In *Leary v. Manstan*, the
court explained that copyright law protects only the non-fiction
author\'s original expression---the author\'s particular manner of
selecting, coordinating, excerpting, modifying, and arranging various
public domain components. [Leary v. Manstan, 118 F.Supp.3d 460
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I4a0e1f5c2ed111e590d4edf60ce7d742/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
Everything else, including the history described and the facts
mentioned, remains in the public domain free for others to draw upon.
[Leary v. Manstan, 118 F.Supp.3d 460
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I4a0e1f5c2ed111e590d4edf60ce7d742/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

The court emphasized that absent wholesale usurpation of another\'s
expression, claims of copyright infringement where works of history are
at issue are rarely successful. [Leary v. Manstan, 118 F.Supp.3d 460
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I4a0e1f5c2ed111e590d4edf60ce7d742/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
Historical phrases would fall within this unprotectable category as they
represent historical facts, events, or interpretations already in the
public domain.

### **Educational Context and Substantiality** 

Educational context affects fair use analysis but does not alter the
underlying copyrightability determination. In *Encyclopaedia Britannica
Educational Corp. v. Crooks*, the Western District of New York noted
that while courts have been receptive to unauthorized use of educational
works, noncommercial or educational motive does not invariably sanction
fair use. [Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corp. v. Crooks, 542
F.Supp. 1156
(1982)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I29d03151556811d997e0acd5cbb90d3f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
Educational purpose must be weighed along with other factors and is not
conclusive of fair use. [Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corp. v.
Crooks, 542 F.Supp. 1156
(1982)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I29d03151556811d997e0acd5cbb90d3f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)

The Second Circuit recognizes that factual works receive broader scope
for fair use than creative works. [Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S.
Holdings, Inc., 931 F.Supp.2d 537
(2013)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I7a71ca3c92c011e2a160cacff148223f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
As explained in *Associated Press v. Meltwater*, works that are
predominantly factual are farther from the core of intended copyright
protection, and accordingly, the scope of fair use is broader with
respect to factual works. [Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings,
Inc., 931 F.Supp.2d 537
(2013)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I7a71ca3c92c011e2a160cacff148223f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362)
However, this enhanced fair use protection does not transform
unprotectable facts into protectable expression.

### **Commentary on This Question** 

Courts distinguish between unprotectable factual content---such as
dates, names, historical events, and common phrases---and protectable
creative expression in copyright substantiality analyses. Factual
elements, ideas, procedures, and commonly used phrases, including
clichéd language and metaphors, lack copyright protection, as
exemplified by expressions like "one if by land, two if by sea" or "poor
white trash" deemed unprotectable stock phrases. Protection extends only
to original, creative expression: unique phrasing, narrative structure,
fictional plot developments, character traits, and stylistic choices
that give factual material a distinctive artistic shape. Infringement
requires copying of such protected expression, not mere facts or
ideas[145 AMJUR POF 3d
1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib800c972ae5511e4a5ffb59432692b35/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362).

The substantial similarity inquiry commonly involves separating
protectable expression from unprotected elements
(abstraction-filtration-comparison in software contexts) and assessing
whether the copied parts constitute a quantitatively and qualitatively
material portion of the original. Courts rely on both objective
extrinsic analysis and subjective intrinsic evaluation, focusing on
overall impression rather than point-by-point comparison. Educational
use or context does not alter the fundamental distinction between fact
and expression in the copyright analysis, though fair use evaluations
may consider purpose and character of use under 17 U.S.C. § 107. The
underlying principle across cases is that copyright safeguards
expression to encourage creativity without monopolizing facts or
ideas[145 AMJUR POF 3d
1](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib800c972ae5511e4a5ffb59432692b35/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=dab4f258-12a0-4f08-a5e9-c1fd633b7362),

  \...Works based on historical or contemporary fact are protected as
  any other literary work except that the portion of the work based on
  fact is not, in itself, protectable.\[1\] Thus, the historical basis
  of such works is not protected, only the particular expression of it.

  respect to plot structure, individual scenes, settings, or features of
  individual characters that reflect historical facts or
  interpretations, those similarities do not count toward the

  protection, an author\'s form of expression must evidence originality.

  or cataloged to determine which elements are protectable. Expert
  testimony is admissible to demonstrate the protectability, or lack of
  it, for specific elements of a work. The extent to which the
  copyrighted work has protectable expression is a matter of law to be

Research Steps

- Researching Second Circuit precedent on the qualitative analysis of
  \"substantiality\" in copyright infringement cases, focusing on
  distinctions between factual and creative elements under the
  substantial similarity test.

  - Second Circuit applies qualitative substantiality test
    distinguishing factual content from creative expression. Courts
    examine whether copying involves protected original expression vs.
    uncopyrightable facts/ideas under idea-expression dichotomy.

- Examining Second Circuit case law addressing the copyrightability and
  infringement analysis of factual content versus creative expression,
  particularly regarding the idea-expression dichotomy in substantiality
  determinations.

  - Factual content (dates, names, events) receives no copyright
    protection. Only \"thin\" protection for original
    selection/arrangement of facts. Historical facts and interpretations
    are unprotectable. Common phrases like \"caught up\" lack
    originality for protection.

- Analyzing Second Circuit decisions that specifically address whether
  courts apply different standards when evaluating copying of factual
  elements (dates, names, events) compared to creative elements
  (original phrasing, metaphors) in substantial similarity analysis.

  - Courts apply different standards: factual elements (dates, names,
    events) receive no protection and cannot support infringement
    claims. Creative elements (original phrasing, metaphors) receive
    protection if minimally creative. Historical phrases like \"one if
    by land, two if by sea\" would be unprotectable as historical
    facts/interpretations in public domain.

- Investigating Second Circuit application of the Feist v. Rural
  Telephone doctrine and its impact on substantiality analysis when
  factual content is allegedly copied versus creative expression.

  - Feist doctrine establishes fact-expression dichotomy as core
    principle in substantiality analysis. Only original
    selection/arrangement of facts receives \"thin\" protection.
    Educational context provides more latitude for fair use but doesn\'t
    change underlying copyrightability analysis - facts remain
    unprotectable regardless of educational purpose.

Questions for further research

1.  **What type of work are you analyzing for potential copyright
    infringement (literary work, educational material, historical
    account, news article, etc.)?**

2.  **Are you concerned about copying specific creative elements like
    original phrasing and metaphors, or primarily factual content like
    dates, names, and events?**

3.  **When you refer to \"educational context,\" are you asking about
    fair use defense for copying or about the copyrightability of
    educational materials themselves?**

4.  **Is the allegedly copied material from a published work with
    registered copyright, or from sources that might be in the public
    domain?**

5.  **Are you dealing with a compilation or arrangement of facts, or
    with copying from narrative works that contain both factual and
    creative elements?**
