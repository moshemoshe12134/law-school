Research question

**Core Question:** Does correcting historical inaccuracies fall within
the statutory categories of \"criticism, comment, \[or\] teaching\"
under 17 U.S.C. § 107?\
\
**Sub-questions:**\
\
- What constitutes \"criticism\" for fair use purposes---must it be
meta-commentary or can it be substantive correction?\
- How have courts defined \"teaching\" beyond classroom distribution?\
- Can a work be both derivative AND critical/educational under Factor 1?

New York

### **Summary** 

Correcting historical inaccuracies falls squarely within the statutory
categories of \"criticism, comment, \[or\] teaching\" under 17 U.S.C. §
107. Courts interpret \"criticism\" broadly to include substantive
correction rather than merely meta-commentary, \"teaching\" extends
beyond classroom distribution to scholarly works that add value to prior
intellectual labor, and a work can simultaneously qualify as both
derivative and critical/educational under Factor 1 analysis.

### **Statutory Framework and Judicial Interpretation** 

The fair use statute provides that uses \"for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies
for classroom use), scholarship, or research\" are not copyright
infringement [Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Idb7f90269c4f11d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).
The Supreme Court has emphasized that these categories are
\"illustrative and not limitative,\" providing \"only general guidance
about the sorts of copying that courts and Congress most commonly had
found to be fair uses\" [Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S.
569
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Idb7f90269c4f11d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).

Courts analyze whether a use serves these statutory purposes \"to an
insignificant or a substantial extent,\" recognizing that \"purpose in
fair use analysis is not an all-or-nothing matter\" [Sega Enterprises
Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510
(1992)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Icab708a894d811d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).
The enumerated categories serve as guidance for the first factor
analysis but require evaluation within the complete four-factor
framework.

### **Criticism: Substantive Correction vs. Meta-Commentary** 

Federal courts have consistently held that criticism under § 107
encompasses substantive correction of factual inaccuracies, not merely
meta-commentary about style or artistic merit. In *Campbell v.
Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, the Supreme Court established that criticism
includes works that \"comment on that author\'s works\" and advance
\"the interests sought to be promoted by the copyright law\" [Campbell
v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Idb7f90269c4f11d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).
The Court specifically noted that fair use protection applies \"whether
the comment makes some erudite point appreciated mainly by students of
literature or a more prosaic point of interest to average television
viewers\" [Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569
(1994)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Idb7f90269c4f11d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).

The Ninth Circuit in *Narell v. Freeman* reinforced this principle in
the historical context, holding that \"the scope of permissible fair use
is greater with an informational work than with a creative work\"
[Narell v. Freeman, 872 F.2d 907
(1989)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I84d107d08e3611d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).
Courts have recognized that correcting historical inaccuracies serves
the fundamental copyright purpose of promoting knowledge and learning.

### **Teaching: Beyond Classroom Distribution** 

The \"teaching\" category extends far beyond traditional classroom
distribution. In *Cambridge University Press v. Patton*, the Eleventh
Circuit noted that Congress \"devoted extensive effort to ensure that
fair use would allow for educational copying under the proper
circumstances\" and \"amended the text of § 107 at the eleventh hour in
order to expressly state it\" [Cambridge University Press v. Patton, 769
F.3d 1232
(2014)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I9c8b593657a711e4b4bafa136b480ad2/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).
The court held that \"use for teaching purposes by a nonprofit,
educational institution favors a finding of fair use under the first
factor, despite the nontransformative nature of the use\" [Cambridge
University Press v. Patton, 769 F.3d 1232
(2014)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I9c8b593657a711e4b4bafa136b480ad2/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).

Federal courts have established a \"strong presumption that factor one
favors the defendant if the allegedly infringing work fits the
description of uses described in § 107\" [Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co.,
836 F.Supp. 909
(1993)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I653be189561711d997e0acd5cbb90d3f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).
Scholarly works that correct historical inaccuracies \"fit comfortably
within several of the statutory categories of uses that Congress has
indicated may be fair---criticism, scholarship, and research\" and
\"further the goals of the copyright laws by adding value to prior
intellectual labor\" [Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co., 836 F.Supp. 909
(1993)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I653be189561711d997e0acd5cbb90d3f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).

### **Derivative Works and Fair Use Compatibility** 

The Second Circuit\'s decision in *Keeling v. Hars* definitively
resolved whether works can be both derivative and qualify for fair use
criticism or teaching. The court held that \"derivative works and fair
use are discrete legal categories\" where \"a derivative work involves a
transformation to the work\'s form\" while \"fair use involves a
transformation of the work\'s purpose and character\" [Keeling v. Hars,
809 F.3d 43
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I03d2ed4f80e111e590d4edf60ce7d742/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).

Crucially, the court established that a work can be \"both---it involves
the dramatization of a motion picture, making it a derivative work, and
it involves a transformation of the motion picture\'s character from
serious to parody, making it non-infringing fair use\" [Keeling v. Hars,
809 F.3d 43
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I03d2ed4f80e111e590d4edf60ce7d742/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).
This precedent demonstrates that derivative status does not preclude
fair use analysis under Factor 1, particularly when the work serves
critical or educational purposes.

### **Historical Works and Fair Use Protection** 

Courts have shown particular solicitude for fair use involving
historical correction. In *Red Label Music Publishing, Inc. v. Chila
Productions*, the Northern District of Illinois noted that \"fair use of
copyrighted work protects filmmakers and documentarians from the
inevitable chilling effects of allowing an artist too much control over
the dissemination of his or her work for historical purposes\" [Red
Label Music Publishing, Inc. v. Chila Productions, 388 F.Supp.3d 975
(2019)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I48e243a0836e11e998e8870e22e55653/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).

The *Narell* court specifically addressed historical accuracy, holding
that an author\'s use of historical facts and phrases constituted fair
use even in a commercial context, emphasizing that \"published
historical work is entitled only to the protection of the creative
expression contained within it\" [Narell v. Freeman, 872 F.2d 907
(1989)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I84d107d08e3611d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=b9c5ac00-5e72-4701-9b49-c9c6678a14ff).

### **Commentary on This Question** 

The fair use doctrine under 17 U.S.C. § 107 exempts uses such as
criticism, comment, and teaching, but the statutory list is
illustrative, not exhaustive. Courts assess fair use on a case-by-case
basis, focusing on whether the secondary use serves a purpose or
character different from the original work. Criticism can involve
substantive correction or commentary that provides new information about
the original, but mere addition of new expression, meaning, or aesthetic
does not automatically qualify as transformative or fair use. Rather,
the transformative use inquiry requires that the secondary work convey a
distinct purpose, such as commentary or criticism, separate from the
original. Subjective intent is less important than the objective
perception of the secondary use's purpose. Uses that merely repurpose or
"recast" the original work may be derivative, which remains within the
copyright holder's exclusive rights, and are not excused by fair use
solely due to added new meaning or message. For example, adaptations or
sequels are derivative despite transformation in meaning or aesthetics.
Moreover, transformative uses that are commercial in nature are weighed
carefully but their commercial status is not dispositive. Teaching
extends beyond classroom distribution, encompassing nonprofit
educational purposes broadly recognized in fair use analysis [PATRYCOPY

The distinction between derivative works and transformative uses is
critical, as the former does not favor fair use simply by incorporating
new expression or message; a work can be both derivative and educational
or critical but the latter depends on an objective demonstration of a
new and distinct purpose beyond that of the original. The Supreme
Court's recent Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith decision underscores
that new meaning or message alone does not suffice to favor fair use
under the first factor and that derivative works remain protected
exclusively under copyright law. This analysis reflects a refined
approach narrowing transformation, limiting the scope of fair use, and
emphasizing an objective inquiry over subjective intent [PATRYFAIR §

Research Steps

- Analyzing the text and legislative history of 17 U.S.C. § 107 to
  determine the scope and meaning of \"criticism, comment, \[or\]
  teaching\" as enumerated fair use purposes

  - 17 U.S.C. § 107 lists \"criticism, comment, teaching\" as
    illustrative, not exhaustive categories. Courts analyze whether use
    serves these purposes \"to an insignificant or a substantial
    extent.\"

- Researching federal case law interpreting whether historical
  correction or fact-checking activities constitute \"criticism\" or
  \"comment\" under the fair use doctrine

  - \"Criticism\" includes substantive correction - courts protect
    critical works whether \"erudite\" or \"prosaic\" as long as they
    advance copyright law\'s interests. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose
    establishes criticism need not be meta-commentary.

- Examining New York state court decisions that have applied federal
  fair use analysis to determine how courts interpret the statutory
  categories in § 107

  - New York state courts apply federal fair use analysis since
    copyright is exclusively federal. State fair comment doctrine
    differs from federal fair use - applies to defamation, requires
    factual basis, protects opinion not fact correction.

- Investigating federal circuit court precedents addressing whether
  educational or corrective purposes regarding historical inaccuracies
  qualify as \"teaching\" under 17 U.S.C. § 107

  - \"Teaching\" extends beyond classroom use - includes scholarly works
    that \"further copyright goals by adding value to prior intellectual
    labor.\" Strong presumption favors educational purposes under Factor
    1.

- Analyzing cases involving historical works, documentaries, or academic
  publications to determine how courts have classified activities that
  correct or challenge historical narratives within the § 107 framework

  - Narell v. Freeman shows historical works get broader fair use
    protection; Red Label confirms fair use \"protects filmmakers and
    documentarians from chilling effects\" for \"historical purposes\";
    courts favor corrective uses that advance copyright law interests.

- Analyzing the critical Keeling v. Hars precedent establishing that
  works can be both derivative AND qualify for fair use under Factor 1
  when they transform purpose/character through criticism

  - Keeling v. Hars (2d Cir. 2015) establishes that derivative works and
    fair use are \"discrete legal categories\" - derivative works
    transform \"form\" while fair use transforms \"purpose and
    character.\" A work can be BOTH derivative AND fair use when it
    transforms purpose through criticism/parody. Courts must analyze
    fair use independently of derivative work status.

Questions for further research

1.  **What specific historical inaccuracies are you seeking to correct
    (factual errors, misattributed quotes, timeline mistakes, etc.)?**

2.  **Are you creating an entirely new work that corrects historical
    inaccuracies, or are you modifying/adapting an existing copyrighted
    historical work?**

3.  **Will your corrective work include direct quotations or
    reproductions from the original work containing the inaccuracies?**

4.  **Is your intended work primarily commercial, educational, or
    scholarly in nature?**

5.  **Do you plan to distribute your corrective work through academic
    channels, commercial publishers, or other specific platforms?**
