Research question

When a transformative work is chosen over the original because it is
educationally superior (more accurate, more complete), does this
constitute actionable market harm or legitimate competition?\
\
**Sub-questions:**\
\
- Does fair use permit transformative works to compete with originals in
same market?\
- How do courts analyze causation---was market loss due to substitution
or due to superiority?\
- What role does consumer choice (Toobin preferring accuracy) play in
market analysis?

2nd Circuit

### **Summary** 

When a transformative work is chosen over the original because it is
educationally superior, this may constitute legitimate competition
rather than actionable market harm, but only if the work is genuinely
transformative under the first fair use factor. The Second Circuit
distinguishes between two types of market harm: (1) harm from
transformative criticism that lowers public estimation of the original,
which supports fair use; and (2) harm from market substitution where the
secondary work serves as a replacement, which argues against fair use.
Educational purpose alone does not confer fair use protection, and
courts apply logical inference rather than requiring complex causation
analysis to determine market harm.

### **Transformative Use Requirements for Educational Works** 

The Second Circuit defines transformative use as work that \"adds
something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering
the first with new expression, meaning, or message.\" [Authors Guild v.
Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I918674d4743311e5a807ad48145ed9f1/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)
[On Davis v. The Gap, Inc., 246 F.3d 152
(2001)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I48d6f39779ad11d9bf29e2067ad74e5b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)
However, the court has explicitly rejected the notion that educational
purpose automatically qualifies for fair use protection. In *Authors
Guild v. Google*, the Second Circuit warned that \"authors who write for
educational purposes, and publishers who invest substantial funds to
publish educational materials, would lose the ability to earn revenues
if users were permitted to copy the materials freely merely because such
copying was in the service of a nonprofit educational mission.\"
[Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202
(2015)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I918674d4743311e5a807ad48145ed9f1/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)

For a work claiming educational superiority to qualify as
transformative, it must serve a fundamentally different purpose than the
original rather than merely providing the same content in a superior
format. The court emphasized in *Hachette Book Group v. Internet
Archive* that copying works \"primarily to supplant the original Works
without adding meaningfully new or different features\" fails the
transformative test, regardless of any claimed improvements. [Hachette
Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)

### **Market Harm Analysis: Source of Harm Determines Fair Use** 

The Second Circuit has established a critical framework for analyzing
market harm that focuses on the source rather than the mere existence of
economic injury. In *United States v. American Society of Composers*,
the court explained that \"when secondary uses harm the market for, or
value of, the original, courts must examine the source of the harm.\"
[U.S. v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers, 599
F.Supp.2d 415
(2009)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/If7ce500104f711deb7e683ba170699a5/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)
The court distinguished two scenarios: harm resulting from
transformative use that \"lowered the public\'s estimation of the
original (such as a devastating review of a book that quotes liberally
from the original to show how silly and poorly written it is)\"
constitutes fair use, while harm where \"the secondary use, by copying
the first, offers itself as a market substitute\" argues strongly
against fair use. [U.S. v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and
Publishers, 599 F.Supp.2d 415
(2009)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/If7ce500104f711deb7e683ba170699a5/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)

This framework suggests that when consumers choose a transformative
educational work over the original because the transformative work
exposes inaccuracies or demonstrates superior scholarship, such market
harm may be permissible as legitimate criticism. However, if consumers
choose the secondary work simply because it provides the same
educational content without payment, this constitutes impermissible
substitution.

### **Causation Analysis and Burden of Proof** 

Courts do not require complex empirical causation analysis to establish
market harm in fair use cases. In *Hachette*, the Second Circuit
rejected the defendant\'s econometric expert analysis attempting to
disprove causation, stating that \"we routinely rely on such logical
inferences where appropriate in assessing the fourth fair use factor.\"
[Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)
The court found it logical that free digital copies would serve as
substitutes for paid originals, concluding there \"would be little
reason for consumers or libraries to pay Publishers for content they
could access for free.\" [Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive,
115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)

The burden falls on the party claiming fair use to \"prove that the
secondary use does not compete in the relevant market.\" [Hachette Book
Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163
(2024)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic33554606ae211ef806a83ea3275ddd8/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)
This burden cannot be met merely by showing the secondary work has
superior educational value if it still functions as a market substitute
for the original\'s primary purpose.

### **Consumer Choice and Legitimate Competition** 

The Second Circuit\'s analysis in the ASCAP case provides guidance on
when consumer preference for accuracy or completeness supports fair use.
When a transformative work competes by offering genuine criticism,
commentary, or scholarship that reveals flaws in the original, market
losses from such competition constitute legitimate harm that does not
defeat fair use. [U.S. v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and
Publishers, 599 F.Supp.2d 415
(2009)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/If7ce500104f711deb7e683ba170699a5/View/FullText.html?transitionType=AIGuidedResearch&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&list=All&listSource=WebsiteInternal&conversationId=29596331-5780-48d9-8881-5d45cd8edba5)
However, the transformative purpose must be genuine and not merely a
pretext for avoiding payment for essentially the same content.

The court\'s emphasis on examining the \"source of harm\" means that
educational superiority alone cannot justify copying unless the
secondary work truly transforms the original\'s purpose and character,
moving beyond mere improvement to genuine scholarly transformation.

### **Commentary on This Question** 

Fair use under 17 U.S.C.A. § 107 balances the public interest in
advancing arts and sciences with the copyright owner\'s exclusive
rights. Courts apply four factors: (1) purpose and character of the use,
including whether it is transformative and commercial; (2) nature of the
copyrighted work; (3) amount and substantiality of the portion used; and
(4) effect on the potential market or value of the original.
Transformative use that adds new expression, meaning, or message and is
noncommercial generally weighs in favor of fair use. Market harm
considered relevant is limited to economic injury from uses that
substitute for the original in its market. Mere competition or loss due
to a work's relative inferiority or superiority, such as consumer
preference for accuracy or completeness in an educational transformative
work, does not necessarily constitute actionable market harm. Courts
distinguish harms arising from substitution from those caused by
non-infringing competitive factors, like consumer choice. Consequently,
even if a transformative work outperforms the original educationally,
this alone often does not establish market harm sufficient to defeat
fair use. The transformative character lessens the likelihood of
substitution harm and the presumption of market harm is weaker or absent
in nonprofit or educational contexts.[77 AMJUR TRIALS

The Second Circuit treats market substitution narrowly, focusing on
whether the secondary use replaces the plaintiff's work commercially or
in licensing markets. If consumers prefer a transformative work because
it is more accurate or complete but the original market remains
unaffected, courts find this distinction critical: uses that merely
compete but do not displace the original\'s market are less likely to
cause actionable market harm. Moreover, courts recognize that fair use
may legitimize competition where a secondary work serves a different
function or purpose, especially in education. Consumer choice favoring
the transformative work does not automatically imply copyright
infringement or market harm in the legal sense.[PATRYFAIR §

Research Steps

- Researching the Second Circuit\'s definition and application of
  \"transformative use\" under the first fair use factor, focusing on
  cases that analyze educational purpose and superiority claims

  - Second Circuit defines transformative use as adding \"something new,
    with a further purpose or different character.\" Cases like Google
    Books and HathiTrust established transformative uses that serve
    different purposes than originals.

- Examining Second Circuit precedent on market harm analysis under the
  fourth fair use factor, specifically how courts evaluate competition
  between original works and alleged fair uses in educational contexts

  - Key framework from ASCAP case: Courts must examine SOURCE of harm.
    If harm results from transformative use lowering public estimation
    (like devastating review), it\'s fair use. If harm comes from market
    substitution, argues against fair use.

- Analyzing Second Circuit case law distinguishing between actionable
  market harm and legitimate competition in fair use determinations,
  particularly where transformative works compete directly with
  originals

  - Hachette establishes clear test: Courts ask whether secondary work
    \"usurps the market\" by offering competing substitute, not whether
    it damages market through criticism. Logical inference standard
    applies - empirical causation data not required.

- Investigating Second Circuit holdings on whether educational
  superiority, accuracy, or completeness of a derivative work affects
  fair use analysis under factors one and four

  - Google Books established that educational purpose alone doesn\'t
    grant fair use immunity - \"Authors who write for educational
    purposes\...would lose ability to earn revenues if users were
    permitted to copy materials freely merely because copying was in
    service of nonprofit educational mission.\" Educational superiority
    must still meet transformative use requirements.

- Researching Second Circuit decisions addressing the intersection of
  transformative use and market substitution when the secondary work is
  chosen over the original for its purported improvements

  - Key principle from ASCAP case applies: When transformative work
    causes market harm by \"lowering public\'s estimation of original\"
    (like devastating review showing inaccuracies), that\'s permissible.
    But when secondary work \"offers itself as market substitute,\" fair
    use fails. Transformative educational superiority that genuinely
    transforms purpose may qualify for former protection.

Questions for further research

1.  **Does the transformative work serve a fundamentally different
    purpose from the original (such as criticism, commentary, or
    research) beyond merely providing more accurate or complete
    information?**

2.  **What specific educational improvements does the secondary work
    claim to offer over the original (corrections, additional analysis,
    different methodology, etc.)?**

3.  **Was the secondary work created primarily to replace the original
    in the same market, or does it target a different audience or serve
    a different educational function?**

4.  **What evidence exists regarding consumer motivations for choosing
    the secondary work over the original?**

5.  **Does the secondary work incorporate substantial portions of the
    original content, or does it primarily reference the original for
    purposes of criticism or analysis?**
