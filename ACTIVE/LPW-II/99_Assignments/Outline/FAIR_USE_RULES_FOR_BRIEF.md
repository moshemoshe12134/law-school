# Fair Use Legal Rules for EchoCraft Brief

## Hierarchical Rule Structure with Context

---

## I. THRESHOLD: FAIR USE ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT

### A. Standard for Deciding Fair Use at Summary Judgment

**RULE:**Fair use may be decided on summary judgment when the material facts are undisputed and the question is whether those facts establish fair use as a matter of law.

> "Fair use may be 'so clearly established by a complaint as to support dismissal of a copyright infringement claim' at the pleading stage."
> *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 34 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168, 178 (2d Cir. 2016))

**CONTEXT:** Courts can resolve fair use on summary judgment because it involves applying legal standards to undisputed facts. When the facts are clear and only legal conclusions remain, there's no need for a jury. This is particularly appropriate when the works themselves demonstrate the transformative nature of the use.

### B. Objective Inquiry Permits Summary Judgment

**RULE:**The fair use inquiry focuses on objective characteristics of the use that a reasonable observer would perceive, not subjective intent, making it suitable for resolution on summary judgment.

> "Whether a secondary use is transformative turns on what a reasonable observer thinks, not the subjective intent of the copyright holder or that of the secondary user."
> *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 34 (2d Cir. 2025)

> "[T]he subjective intent of the user (or the subjective interpretation of a court) [does not] determine the purpose of the use."
> *Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508, 544 (2023)

**CONTEXT:** Because courts assess what a "reasonable observer" would think (an objective standard), summary judgment is appropriate when the record establishes how a reasonable observer would perceive the use. Courts need not probe subjective motivations or hold evidentiary hearings about artistic intent.

**APPLICATION TO ECHOCRAFT:** The court can compare Riven's song and EchoCraft's version side-by-side, examine how each is marketed and used, and determine as a matter of law what a reasonable observer would perceive about their respective purposes.

## II. FOUNDATIONAL COPYRIGHT PRINCIPLES

### A. Copyright's Purpose and the Fair Use Exception

**RULE:**Copyright promotes creativity by granting exclusive rights, but fair use prevents copyright from stifling follow-on creativity that builds upon existing works.

> "Fair use is an affirmative defense that excuses what might otherwise be considered infringing behavior, allowing courts to avoid rigid application of the Copyright Act when it would stifle the very creativity the Act is meant to promote."
> *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 33-34 (2d Cir. 2025) (internal quotation marks omitted)

> "The goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works."
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994)

**CONTEXT:** This establishes WHY fair use exists—not to undermine copyright, but to fulfill its constitutional purpose. Fair use recognizes that all creativity builds on what came before, and overly rigid copyright protection would paradoxically harm creativity.

### B. The Four-Factor Holistic Test

**RULE:**Courts must analyze all four statutory factors and weigh them together; no single factor is dispositive, and the inquiry is flexible depending on context.

> "The task is not to be simplified with bright-line rules, for the statute, like the doctrine it recognizes, calls for case-by-case analysis."
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 577 (1994)

> "Nor may the four statutory factors be treated in isolation, one from another. All are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."
> *Id.* at 578

**STATUTORY FACTORS (17 U.S.C. § 107):**

1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether commercial or nonprofit educational
2. The nature of the copyrighted work
3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used
4. The effect upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

**CONTEXT:** This prevents mechanical application of any single factor. Even if one factor weighs heavily against fair use, the others can still tip the balance. The holistic analysis ensures courts consider copyright's broader purposes.

---

## III. FACTOR 1: PURPOSE AND CHARACTER OF USE

### A. The Central Question: Transformative Purpose

**RULE:**Factor 1 asks whether the new work adds something new with a further purpose or different character, or merely supersedes the original. The more transformative, the less other factors (like commercialism) matter.

> "The central purpose of this investigation is to see, in Justice Story's words, whether the new work merely 'supersede[s] the objects' of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message."
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)

> "The more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use."
> *Id.*

**CONTEXT:** Transformation is the heart of Factor 1 because it identifies uses that further copyright's goal of promoting new creativity. A work that merely replaces the original contributes nothing new; a work that transforms the original adds value to society.

### B. Focus on the Specific Use, Not the Work in Abstract

**RULE:**Courts must examine the purpose and character of the specific challenged use in the marketplace, not evaluate the artistic merit or transformative qualities of the secondary work in isolation.

> "Here, the specific use of Goldsmith's photograph alleged to infringe her copyright is AWF's licensing of Orange Prince to Condé Nast. As portraits of Prince used to depict Prince in magazine stories about Prince, the original photograph and AWF's copying use of it share substantially the same purpose."
> *Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508, 526 (2023)

> "Whether the purpose and character of a use weighs in favor of fair use is ... an objective inquiry into what use was made, i.e., what the user does with the original work."
> *Id.* at 545

**CONTEXT:** Warhol's key innovation was refocusing from "is the new work transformative?" to "is the specific use transformative?" This prevents artistic merit from automatically conferring fair use regardless of how the work is actually deployed in the market.

**CRITICAL FOR ECHOCRAFT:** EchoCraft's specific use is parody/satire of Riven's overly-adulatory perspective on Paul Revere. The purpose is not merely to teach history differently, but to critique and mock the original's uncritical 'hero-worship' by presenting corrected historical facts that undermine its celebratory narrative.

### C. The Parody/Satire Distinction: Critical Bearing Requirement

**RULE:** Parody (commentary on the original work) has a stronger fair use claim than satire (commentary on society using the original work) because parody requires conjuring up the original to make its critical point.

> "For the purposes of copyright law, the nub of the definitions, and the heart of any parodist's claim to quote from existing material, is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works."
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 580 (1994)

> "Parody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim's (or collective victims') imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing."
> *Id.* at 580-81

**THE CRITICAL BEARING TEST:** The secondary work's commentary must have "critical bearing on" the original work itself.

> "Because it [AWF's asserted commentary] 'has no critical bearing on' Goldsmith's photograph, the commentary's 'claim to fairness in borrowing from' her work 'diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish).'"
> *Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508, 546-47 (2023) (quoting *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580)

**CONTEXT:** This distinction matters because parody cannot function without using the original (you must evoke the target to criticize it), while satire could use anything as its vehicle. Copyright law accommodates the unique necessity of parody while requiring satirists to find other ways to make their social commentary.

**APPLICATION FOR ECHOCRAFT:** EchoCraft must is criticizing **RIVEN'S SONG'S** perpetuation of myths, not just educating about history generally.

### D. Kennedy's Two-Prong Parody Test

**RULE:** Parody must: (1) target the original work specifically (not just its genre or style), and (2) require borrowing from that specific original to make its critical point.

> "Parody may qualify as fair use only if it draws upon the original composition to make humorous or ironic commentary about that same composition... The parody must target the original, and not just its general style, the genre of art to which it belongs, or society as a whole."
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 597 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring)

> "[T]he copied work must be, at least in part, an object of the parody; otherwise, there is no need to conjure it up."
> *Id.* (citing *MCA, Inc. v. Wilson*, 677 F.2d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 1981))

**CONTEXT:** Kennedy's concurrence (joined by the majority's reasoning) posits that not every creative transformation qualifies for parody's special protection. The original must be the *target*, not merely the *tool* for commentary.

**APPLICATION TO ECHOCRAFT:** Riven's song is the target: EchoCraft is mocking his adulatory, hero-worship perspective on Paul Revere by undermining it with corrected historical facts. EchoCraft is not just teaching history (using his song as a tool); it is critiquing his specific take as historically inaccurate and uncritically celebratory.

### E. Commercial vs. Nonprofit Educational Purpose

**RULE:** While commercial nature tends against fair use, it is not dispositive. Nonprofit educational purpose weighs in favor of fair use, especially when combined with transformative use.

> "The language of the statute makes clear that the commercial or nonprofit educational purpose of a work is only one element of the first factor enquiry into its purpose and character."
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 584 (1994)

> "If, indeed, commerciality carried presumptive force against a finding of fairness, the presumption would swallow nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107, including news reporting, comment, criticism, teaching, scholarship, and research, since these activities 'are generally conducted for profit in this country.'"
> *Id.*

**CONTEXT:** This prevents commercialism from becoming an automatic bar to fair use, while still acknowledging it as a relevant consideration. The statute explicitly distinguishes "commercial" from "nonprofit educational," suggesting the latter deserves special consideration.

**APPLICATION TO ECHOCRAFT:** EchoCraft's nonprofit structure, below-cost licensing, and educational mission strongly support Factor 1, especially when combined with its transformative critical purpose.

## IV. FACTOR 3: AMOUNT AND SUBSTANTIALITY OF PORTION USED

### A. Parody's Special Latitude for Copying

**RULE:** Parody may copy the "heart" of the original if necessary to "conjure up" the original for purposes of making recognizable criticism, but must thereafter depart markedly.

> "Parody presents a difficult case. Parody's humor, or in any event its comment, necessarily springs from recognizable allusion to its object through distorted imitation... When parody takes aim at a particular original work, the parody must be able to 'conjure up' at least enough of that original to make the object of its critical wit recognizable."
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 588 (1994)

> "If quotation of the opening riff and the first line may be said to go to the 'heart' of the original, the heart is also what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim. Copying does not become excessive in relation to parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the original's heart."
> *Id.*

**MARKED DEPARTURE REQUIREMENT:**

> "It is significant that 2 Live Crew not only copied the first line of the original, but thereafter departed markedly from the Orbison lyrics for its own ends."
> *Id.* at 589

**CONTEXT:** This rule balances the need for parody to evoke the original (requiring substantial copying) against copyright's interest in protecting creative expression (limiting copying to what's necessary). The "conjure up" standard recognizes parody's unique functional requirements.

**APPLICATION TO ECHOCRAFT:** EchoCraft's 87.5% copying is defensible if: (1) it establishes parody/critical purpose under Factor 1, (2) the melody is the "heart" that makes the song memorable/educational, and (3) it "departed markedly" in the lyrics (100% different words with corrected historical narrative).

## V. FACTOR 4: EFFECT ON POTENTIAL MARKET

### A. Substitution vs. Critical Suppression

**RULE:** Factor 4 asks whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original by serving as a substitute, not whether it damages the market through effective criticism or parody.

> "We ask not whether the second work would damage the market for the first (by, for example, devaluing it through parody or criticism), but whether it usurps the market for the first by offering a competing substitute."
> *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 189 (2d Cir. 2024))

> "When a lethal parody, like a scathing theater review, kills demand for the original, it does not produce a harm cognizable under the Copyright Act. [T]he role of the courts is to distinguish between '[b]iting criticism [that merely] suppresses demand [and] copyright infringement[, which] usurps it.'"
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 591-92 (1994) (quoting *Fisher v. Dees*, 794 F.2d 432, 438 (9th Cir. 1986))

**CONTEXT:** This distinction is fundamental to reconciling fair use with copyright protection. If criticism could be barred because it reduces demand for the criticized work, copyright would become a tool for censorship. Only substitutive harm (where consumers choose the copy instead of the original for the same purpose) counts.

**APPLICATION TO ECHOCRAFT:** If schools reject Riven's song because EchoCraft's criticism is effective (they realize it teaches false history), that's critical suppression—not cognizable harm. Only if schools choose EchoCraft's version as an entertaining substitute for the same entertainment purpose would that be usurpation.

### B. No Derivative Market for Criticism of the Original Work

**RULE:** There is no protectible derivative market for works that criticize the original, because copyright holders would not license others to create critical reviews or lampoons of their own works.

> "The unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market."
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 592 (1994)

**RECENT REAFFIRMATION:**

> "[T]he unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market."
> *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Campbell*)

**CONTEXT:** This rule prevents copyright holders from using control over derivative works to suppress criticism. The derivative works right protects markets the copyright holder would actually exploit; it doesn't extend to works the holder would never authorize (criticism of their own work).

**CRITICAL FOR ECHOCRAFT:** Even if Riven has (or could develop) an educational licensing market, he would never license songs that **criticize his own song's historical inaccuracies**. There is no market for "educational derivatives that point out why Riven's version is pedagogically inadequate." Therefore, any educational licensing market he might have doesn't extend to critical educational derivatives.

**THIS IS YOUR KEY FACTOR 4 ARGUMENT:** Riven's potential educational market is for entertainment-educational derivatives (fun songs that teach), not critical-educational derivatives (songs that critique his song's failings). You're not competing in his market; you're operating in the "no licensing market" zone of criticism.

## VI. APPLYING THE FRAMEWORK TO ECHOCRAF T

### Your Core Argument Structure:

**1. FACTOR 1 (Purpose and Character):**

- **Primary:** Parody with critical bearing on Riven's song

  - Riven's song presents an adulatory, hero-worship perspective on Paul Revere
  - Our song targets and mocks that adulatory perspective by correcting historical inaccuracies
  - We use his melody to "conjure up" his version, then undermine its celebratory narrative
  - Critical bearing: commentary on the original's uncritical, mythologizing approach
- **Secondary:** Distinct purpose (critical parody vs. adulatory entertainment)

  - Reasonable observer would perceive: Riven's = celebratory/mythic narrative, Ours = ironic critique
  - Functionally different: uncritical hero-worship vs. corrective commentary
- **Tertiary:** Nonprofit educational purpose

  - Nonprofit entity, below-cost licensing
  - Statutory language favors "nonprofit educational purposes"

**2. FACTOR 3 (Amount Copied):**

- Melody is the "heart" for memorization purposes
- Necessary to "conjure up" Riven's version to criticize it
- "Departed markedly" in lyrics (100% different, corrected narrative)
- High percentage justified by pedagogical necessity

**3. FACTOR 4 (Market Effect):**

- **Primary:** No derivative market for criticism

  - Riven would never license corrections of his own inaccuracies
  - Any educational market is for entertainment-educational derivatives, not critical derivatives
- **Secondary:** Critical suppression, not market substitution

  - Any harm is from effective criticism (schools reject Riven because it's wrong)
  - Not substitution (schools choosing ours for entertainment value)
- **Tertiary:** No established educational licensing market

  - Only preliminary negotiations, no executed contracts
  - Nonprofit educational use doesn't compete with commercial entertainment market

**4. HOLISTIC BALANCING:**

- Even if Factor 1 is contested, strong Factors 3 and 4 tip the balance
- Nonprofit educational criticism serving core First Amendment values
- Copyright's purpose (promoting creativity and knowledge) favored by allowing critical educational works

## VII. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STRATEGY

**Key Points for Your Outline:**

1. **Objective Standard Permits SJ:** Court can compare the works and determine what reasonable observer would think about their purposes
2. **Undisputed Facts:** The songs themselves, marketing materials, licensing practices, and organizational structure are objective evidence
3. **Legal Question:** Once facts are established, whether those facts constitute fair use is a legal question appropriate for SJ
4. **Critical Framing:** Your entire case depends on establishing that you're criticizing **RIVEN'S ADULATORY PERSPECTIVE** specifically—mocking his hero-worship take by presenting corrective facts—not just teaching history
5. **No Genuine Dispute:** If reasonable minds could not differ that a reasonable observer would perceive your work as critical commentary on Riven's song, SJ is appropriate

**One-Sentence Thesis for Each Factor:**

- Factor 1: Reasonable observer would perceive EchoCraft's work as parody/satire targeting Riven's adulatory perspective on Paul Revere, undermining his celebratory narrative with corrected historical facts.
- Factor 3: Copying the melody was necessary to "conjure up" Riven's version for recognizable criticism, and we departed markedly in lyrics.
- Factor 4: No derivative market exists for songs criticizing Riven's own work, and any harm is from critical suppression, not market substitution.
