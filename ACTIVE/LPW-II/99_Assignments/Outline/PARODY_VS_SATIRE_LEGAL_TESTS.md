# Parody vs. Satire: Legal Tests and Fact Application
## Concrete Element Tests for Fair Use Analysis

---

## I. THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION: PARODY VS. SATIRE

### A. The Supreme Court's Definitional Test

**PARODY (Protected):**
> "For purposes of copyright law, the heart of any parodist's claim to quote from existing material is **the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works**."  
> *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 580 (1994) (emphasis added)

**SATIRE (Requires Independent Justification):**
> "Parody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim's (or collective victims') imagination, whereas **satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing**."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580-81

---

### B. Justice Kennedy's Two-Prong Test for Parody (Concurrence in Campbell)

**PRONG 1: TARGET REQUIREMENT**
> "Parody may qualify as fair use **only if it draws upon the original composition to make humorous or ironic commentary about that same composition**."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 597 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added)

**PRONG 2: NECESSITY OF BORROWING**
> "**The copied work must be, at least in part, an object of the parody**; otherwise, there is no need to conjure it up."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 597 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (citing *MCA, Inc. v. Wilson*, 677 F.2d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 1981))

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:**
> "It is not enough that the parody use the original in a humorous fashion, however creative that humor may be. **The parody must target the original**, and not just its general style, the genre of art to which it belongs, or society as a whole (although if it targets the original, it may target those features as well)."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 597 (Kennedy, J., concurring)

**APPLICATION NOTE:**
> "Though the satire need not be only of the copied work and may... also be a parody of modern society, **the copied work must be, at least in part, an object of the parody**."  
> *Rogers v. Koons*, 960 F.2d 301, 310 (2d Cir. 1992) (cited approvingly in Campbell)

---

## II. WARHOL'S REFINEMENT: "CRITICAL BEARING" TEST

### A. The "Critical Bearing" Requirement

**THE TEST:**
> "Because it [AWF's asserted commentary] '**has no critical bearing on**' Goldsmith's photograph, the commentary's 'claim to fairness in borrowing from' her work 'diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish).' The commercial nature of the use, on the other hand, 'loom[s] larger.'"  
> *Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508, 546-47 (2023) (quoting *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580)

**CONTRAST WITH PARODY:**
> "Like satire that does not target an original work, AWF's asserted commentary '**can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing**.' Moreover, because AWF's commercial use of Goldsmith's photograph to illustrate a magazine about Prince is **so similar to the photograph's typical use**, a particularly compelling justification is needed."  
> *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 547

---

### B. What Counts as "Critical Bearing"?

**EXAMPLES THAT DO NOT SATISFY:**
1. **Commentary on celebrity culture generally** (Warhol's "dehumanizing nature of celebrity" did not have critical bearing on Goldsmith's *photograph*)
2. **Using the original to comment on something else** (satire uses original as vehicle for broader social commentary)
3. **New aesthetic or meaning without targeting the original** (transformation alone insufficient)

**EXAMPLES THAT DO SATISFY:**
1. **Campbell's parody:** 2 Live Crew's song "commenting on the naiveté of the original" by juxtaposing Orbison's romantic musings with "degrading taunts" showing "ugliness of street life"
2. **Criticism of the original's style, substance, or message** that requires conjuring up the original to make the point

---

## III. DETERMINING "PURPOSE" OF A USE (Post-Warhol Framework)

### A. Subjective Intent vs. Objective Use

**THE KEY DISTINCTION:**

**Warhol REJECTS subjective intent analysis:**
> "Whether a work is transformative cannot turn merely on **the stated or perceived intent of the artist** or the meaning or impression that a critic—or for that matter, a judge—draws from the work."  
> *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 545 (HN21)

**Warhol REQUIRES objective use analysis:**
> "Whether the purpose and character of a use weighs in favor of fair use is, instead, an **objective inquiry into what use was made, i.e., what the user does with the original work**."  
> *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 545 (HN22)

**Santos v. Kimmel confirms the test (2d Cir. 2025):**
> "Whether a secondary use is transformative turns on **what a reasonable observer thinks**, not the subjective intent of the copyright holder or that of the secondary user... **'[T]he subjective intent of the user (or the subjective interpretation of a court) [does not] determine the purpose of the use.'**"  
> *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 34 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 544)

**Gorsuch Concurrence (emphasizing statutory text):**
> "Nothing in the copyright statute calls on judges to speculate about the purpose an artist may have in mind when working on a particular project. Nothing in the law requires judges to try their hand at art criticism and assess the aesthetic character of the resulting work. Instead, the first statutory fair-use factor instructs courts to focus on '**the purpose and character of the use**'... It's a comparatively modest inquiry focused on **how and for what reason a person is using a copyrighted work in the world**, not on the moods of any artist or the aesthetic quality of any creation."  
> *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 553-54 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (emphasis added)

---

### B. The "Specific Use" Test

**WARHOL'S FRAMEWORK:**

1. **Identify the specific challenged use:**
   > "The use is AWF's commercial licensing of Orange Prince to appear on the cover of Condé Nast's special commemorative edition."  
   > *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 545-46

2. **Determine the purpose of that specific use:**
   > "The purpose of that use is, still, to illustrate a magazine about Prince with a portrait of Prince."  
   > *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 546

3. **Compare to the original work's purpose:**
   > "As portraits of Prince used to depict Prince in magazine stories about Prince, the original photograph and AWF's copying use of it **share substantially the same purpose**."  
   > *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 526

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
> "Although the purpose could be more specifically described as illustrating a magazine about Prince with a portrait of Prince, one that portrays Prince somewhat differently from Goldsmith's photograph (**yet has no critical bearing on her photograph**), that degree of difference is not enough for the first factor to favor AWF, given the specific context of the use."  
> *Warhol*, 598 U.S. at 546 (emphasis added)

---

### C. How to Prove "Different Purpose"

**ACCEPTABLE EVIDENCE:**

1. **What a reasonable observer would think:**
   - How would a reasonable observer perceive the purpose of the use?
   - What message/function is objectively conveyed?
   - *Santos v. Kimmel*: "reasonable observer would think the videos conveyed 'feelings of hope, strength, perseverance, encouragement, and positivity,' not a willingness to say absurd things for money" (even though defendant argued that was his subjective intent)

2. **Market function of the use:**
   - Where is the work distributed?
   - Who is the audience?
   - What function does it serve for that audience?

3. **Relationship to original:**
   - Does the use comment on/criticize the original? (parody)
   - Does it serve a different market function? (criticism, scholarship, teaching)
   - Does it provide information about the original unavailable elsewhere?

4. **Justification for copying:**
   - Why was copying necessary?
   - What would be lost without access to the original?

**REJECTED EVIDENCE:**

1. **Subjective artistic intent** (what the creator wanted to accomplish)
   - *Warhol*: Subjective intent does not determine purpose
   - *Santos*: Copyright holder's subjective intent irrelevant (Santos argued *he* intended to show "willingness to say absurd things for money"—court rejected this)
   - *Santos*: Secondary user's subjective intent irrelevant (Kimmel's false representations/"bad faith" did not affect fair use analysis)

2. **Aesthetic differences alone** (new style, new meaning, new message—without more)

3. **General social commentary** (using original to comment on society, not original itself)

4. **"Bad faith" of secondary user** (*Santos* explicitly rejects this)
   - Supreme Court has "expressed some skepticism about whether bad faith has any role in a fair use analysis"
   - "Copyright is not a privilege reserved for the well-behaved" (*Google LLC v. Oracle*)
   - Even false representations/fraud to obtain the copyrighted work does not nullify fair use defense

---

## IV. FACTOR 4: "POTENTIAL MARKET" ANALYSIS

### A. The Statutory Language

**17 U.S.C. § 107(4):**
> "the effect of the use upon **the potential market for or value of** the copyrighted work"

### B. Supreme Court Interpretation

**Campbell's Two-Part Test:**

**PART 1: Harm to Original Market**
> "The enquiry 'must take account not only of **harm to the original** but also of **harm to the market for derivative works**."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 590 (quoting *Harper & Row*, 471 U.S. at 568)

**PART 2: Widespread Conduct Test**
> "It requires courts to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also '**whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant... would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market**' for the original."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 590 (HN14) (quoting Nimmer § 13.05[A][4])

---

### C. What Constitutes "Established Market" vs. "Potential Market"?

**KEY DISTINCTION:**

**ESTABLISHED MARKET** (Harm cognizable):
- Markets the copyright holder **actually exploits** or **in general would develop or license others to develop**
- Example: Goldsmith licensed her photo to magazines; magazine licensing is established market

**SPECULATIVE MARKET** (Harm NOT cognizable):
- Markets based on **preliminary negotiations without executed agreements**
- Markets the copyright holder **would not in general develop** (e.g., critical derivatives)

**THE "WOULD IN GENERAL DEVELOP" TEST:**
> "The market for potential derivative uses includes **only those that creators of original works would in general develop or license others to develop**."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592

---

### D. No Derivative Market for Criticism

**THE RULE:**
> "Yet the **unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions** removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592

**RECENT REAFFIRMATION (2d Cir. 2025):**
> "'[T]he unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market.'"  
> *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Campbell*)

**REASONING:**
> "'People ask... for criticism, but they only want praise.'"  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592 (quoting S. Maugham, *Of Human Bondage* 241)

**APPLICATION:**
> "Thus, to the extent that the opinion below may be read to have considered harm to the market for parodies of 'Oh, Pretty Woman,' the court erred."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592

---

### E. Market Substitution vs. Critical Suppression

**THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**MARKET SUBSTITUTION (Cognizable Harm):**
> "Because 'parody may quite legitimately aim at garroting the original, destroying it commercially as well as artistically,' the role of the courts is to distinguish between '**[b]iting criticism [that merely] suppresses demand [and] copyright infringement[, which] usurps it**."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592 (HN16) (quoting *Fisher v. Dees*, 794 F.2d at 438)

**CRITICAL SUPPRESSION (NOT Cognizable Harm):**
> "We do not, of course, suggest that a parody may not harm the market at all, but **when a lethal parody, like a scathing theater review, kills demand for the original, it does not produce a harm cognizable under the Copyright Act**."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 591-92 (HN16)

**RATIONALE:**
> "The fact that a parody may impair the market for derivative uses by the very effectiveness of its critical commentary is no more relevant under copyright than the like threat to the original market."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 593

---

### F. Burden of Proof on Factor 4

**Campbell's Holding:**
> "Since fair use is an affirmative defense, **its proponent would have difficulty carrying the burden of demonstrating fair use without favorable evidence about relevant markets**."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 590 (HN15)

**BUT: No Presumption of Harm from Commercial Use in Transformative Context:**
> "No 'presumption' or inference of market harm that might find support in *Sony* is applicable to a case involving something beyond mere duplication for commercial purposes... But **when, on the contrary, the second use is transformative, market substitution is at least less certain, and market harm may not be so readily inferred**."  
> *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 591

---

## V. APPLICATION TO ECHOCRAF T'S FACTS

### A. Is EchoCraft's Use "Parody" or "Satire"?

#### LUNA'S LIKELY ARGUMENT (Satire):

**Applying Kennedy's Two-Prong Test:**

1. **Target Requirement:** EchoCraft does NOT target Riven's song itself; it targets **historical inaccuracies** (general subject)
2. **Necessity of Borrowing:** EchoCraft could have written an original song to teach correct history; no need to "conjure up" Riven's work

**Applying Warhol's "Critical Bearing" Test:**
- EchoCraft's commentary on historical accuracy has **no critical bearing on Riven's song**
- Like Warhol's "commentary on celebrity," EchoCraft comments on history generally
- Therefore: "can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing"

**Conclusion:** Satire, not parody → commercial nature "looms larger"

---

#### ECHOCRAF T'S COUNTERARGUMENT (Parody):

**Reframing Under Kennedy's Test:**

1. **Target Requirement:** EchoCraft DOES target Riven's song—specifically, **Riven's song's perpetuation of historical myths**
   - We're not criticizing "history" abstractly
   - We're criticizing **this specific song's teaching of false history**
   - The "object of the parody" is Riven's educational content, not history generally

2. **Necessity of Borrowing:** We MUST use Riven's melody to "conjure up" his work because:
   - Students learned false history from Riven's catchy tune
   - To correct the specific harm Riven's song caused, we need to use his melody
   - Our criticism has "critical bearing" on his work's **educational impact**

**Reframing Under Warhol's "Critical Bearing" Test:**
- Our commentary has "critical bearing" on **Riven's song's** educational inadequacy
- We're not using Riven's song as a vehicle for general historical education
- We're **targeting the specific false narrative Riven's song embeds in students' minds**
- This is analogous to 2 Live Crew targeting "naiveté of the original" romantic song

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION FROM WARHOL:**
- Warhol's "commentary on celebrity" could have used ANY celebrity photo (no critical bearing on Goldsmith's photo specifically)
- EchoCraft's "commentary on historical inaccuracy" MUST use **Riven's song** specifically because we're correcting the false narrative HIS work perpetuates

**Conclusion:** Parody with critical bearing on original → nonprofit educational purpose weighs in our favor

---

### B. "Purpose" Analysis Under Warhol Framework

#### LUNA'S LIKELY ARGUMENT (Same Purpose):

**Step 1: Identify Specific Use**
- EchoCraft's licensing to schools for educational memorization

**Step 2: Purpose of Use**
- To teach historical events through a catchy melody

**Step 3: Compare to Original**
- Riven's song also licensed to schools (via education department) for educational memorization
- Both serve the same purpose: **education through music**

**Step 4: Commercial Nature**
- EchoCraft charges schools (even if below cost)
- Commercial + same purpose = Factor 1 weighs against fair use (Warhol HN14)

**Conclusion:** Substantially the same purpose → Factor 1 against EchoCraft

---

#### ECHOCRAF T'S COUNTERARGUMENT (Different Purpose):

**KEY FACTS TO EMPHASIZE:**

1. **Riven's Subjective Intent (If Provable on Summary Judgment):**
   - Riven stated he "doesn't care about Paul Revere" and "doesn't actually know much about him"
   - This suggests his purpose was **entertainment**, not education
   - Even if later licensed to schools, original purpose was commercial entertainment

2. **Objective Use Analysis:**
   - **Riven's Purpose:** Entertainment through historical narrative (accuracy not a goal)
   - **EchoCraft's Purpose:** Critical education—correcting historical inaccuracies (accuracy is THE goal)
   
3. **Functional Distinction:**
   - **Riven's Function:** Passive learning through repetition (memorize narrative)
   - **EchoCraft's Function:** Active critical thinking (question received narratives, distinguish myth from reality)

**APPLYING WARHOL'S "SPECIFIC USE" TEST:**

**Step 1: Specific Use**
- EchoCraft's below-cost licensing to schools through nonprofit entity

**Step 2: Purpose of Use**  
- **NOT just "education"** (too broad)
- **SPECIFIC PURPOSE:** "Critical correction of historical inaccuracies in popular educational content"
- This is **pedagogical criticism**, analogous to literary criticism

**Step 3: Compare to Original**
- **Riven's Actual Use:** Commercial entertainment with incidental educational adoption
- **Luna's Potential Use:** Educational licensing (but only preliminary negotiations, no established market)

**Step 4: Different Function**
- **Riven:** Students memorize entertaining narrative (may be historically false)
- **EchoCraft:** Students develop critical thinking by comparing competing narratives

**Conclusion:** Functionally distinct purpose → Nonprofit educational purpose weighs in favor → Factor 1 supports fair use

---

### C. Factor 4: Market Harm Analysis

#### LUNA'S LIKELY ARGUMENT:

1. **Potential Market Harmed:**
   - Luna had preliminary discussions with schools about educational licensing
   - This establishes a "potential market" for educational derivatives
   - EchoCraft's use harms this potential market

2. **Record Label Education Department:**
   - Record label has education department
   - This proves established market for educational music licensing
   - EchoCraft competes in this market

3. **Widespread Conduct Test:**
   - If all educational users could copy songs for "critical" purposes without licensing, it would substantially harm copyright holders' educational markets

**Conclusion:** Factor 4 weighs against EchoCraft

---

#### ECHOCRAF T'S COUNTERARGUMENT:

**PRIMARY ARGUMENT: No Established Market**

1. **Preliminary Negotiations ≠ Established Market:**
   - Luna had only exploratory discussions, no executed contracts
   - No evidence Riven actually exploits educational licensing market
   - "Potential market" means markets copyright holder "would in general develop," not pure speculation

2. **Entertainment vs. Educational Market:**
   - Riven's established market: commercial entertainment (radio play, streaming, downloads)
   - Educational licensing: unexploited preliminary market at best
   - We don't compete with his entertainment market

**SECONDARY ARGUMENT: No Derivative Market for Criticism**

3. **Applying Campbell's "Would In General Develop" Test:**
   - Would Riven "in general" license **critical corrections** of his historical inaccuracies?
   - No—"People ask for criticism, but they only want praise" (*Campbell*)
   - Therefore: no protectible derivative market for critical educational derivatives
   - **Recently reaffirmed:** *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th at 35 (2d Cir. 2025) ("unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market")

**TERTIARY ARGUMENT: Critical Suppression, Not Market Substitution**

4. **Applying Campbell's Suppression vs. Usurpation Test:**
   - If schools choose EchoCraft because our **criticism of Riven's inaccuracies** is effective, that's critical suppression (not cognizable)
   - Only if schools choose us because we're **entertaining substitutes** (not for critical value), that's market usurpation (cognizable)

5. **Burden of Proof:**
   - Luna bears burden to prove market harm with evidence
   - Preliminary negotiations insufficient
   - No evidence schools would choose EchoCraft as entertainment substitute vs. critical educational tool

**Conclusion:** No established market + no derivative market for criticism + critical suppression not cognizable harm = Factor 4 weighs in favor of EchoCraft

---

## VI. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Primary Argument (Strongest):

**FRAME AS PARODY WITH CRITICAL BEARING:**
1. We target **Riven's song's** perpetuation of historical myths, not history generally
2. Critical bearing on his work's educational impact justifies copying
3. Pedagogical necessity: must use his melody to displace false memories he created
4. This is educational criticism, analogous to literary criticism in Campbell

**SUPPORT WITH "DIFFERENT PURPOSE":**
5. Our purpose: critical pedagogy (active thinking)
6. Riven's purpose: entertainment (passive memorization)
7. Functionally distinct, not "substantially the same"

**REINFORCE WITH NONPROFIT STATUS:**
8. Nonprofit entity, below-cost licensing
9. Factor 1's "nonprofit educational purposes" language supports us
10. Warhol distinguished because that was commercial art licensing; we're nonprofit education

---

### B. Defensive Argument (Factor 4):

**NO MARKET HARM:**
1. No established educational market (preliminary negotiations only)
2. No derivative market for criticism (wouldn't license corrections)
3. Any harm from critical suppression not cognizable under Factor 4
4. Luna bears evidentiary burden; lacks proof of market substitution

---

### C. Vulnerabilities to Address:

**VULNERABILITY 1: 87.5% Copying**
- **Luna's Attack:** Excessive copying beyond Campbell's "opening riff + first line"
- **Our Defense:** Melody is the "heart" for memorization; needed to "conjure up" original; departed markedly in lyrics (100% different)

**VULNERABILITY 2: "Satire" Characterization**
- **Luna's Attack:** General historical commentary, no critical bearing on Riven's work
- **Our Defense:** Target is Riven's specific perpetuation of myths; critical bearing on his educational impact; pedagogical necessity

**VULNERABILITY 3: "Same Purpose" Finding**
- **Luna's Attack:** Both are educational uses in schools
- **Our Defense:** Functional distinction (entertainment vs. criticism); nonprofit vs. commercial; critical pedagogy vs. passive memorization

---

## VII. LEGAL TESTS SUMMARY CHECKLIST

### ☐ PARODY VS. SATIRE TEST (Kennedy, Campbell)
- [ ] Does secondary work **target the original work itself**? (Not just style/genre/society)
- [ ] Is the original work "at least in part, an object of the parody"?
- [ ] Does the copying have "critical bearing on" the original work? (Warhol)

### ☐ "PURPOSE" ANALYSIS (Warhol)
- [ ] Identify the **specific challenged use** (not the work itself)
- [ ] Determine **objective purpose** of that use (how/for what reason it's used "in the world")
- [ ] Compare to original's purpose: **substantially the same** or **functionally distinct**?
- [ ] Reject subjective artist intent; focus on market function

### ☐ FACTOR 4 MARKET HARM (Campbell)
- [ ] Is there an **established market** (actual exploitation) or only speculative potential?
- [ ] Is it a market copyright holder "would in general develop or license"?
- [ ] Is there a **derivative market for criticism**? (Generally no)
- [ ] Is harm from **market substitution** (cognizable) or **critical suppression** (not cognizable)?
- [ ] Does defendant have evidentiary burden with proof of market harm?

### ☐ AMOUNT COPIED (Campbell)
- [ ] Was copying necessary to "conjure up" original for critical purpose?
- [ ] Did secondary work "depart markedly" after initial copying?
- [ ] Is the "heart" of original necessary for the parodic/critical point?

---

## VIII. CRITICAL FACT DEVELOPMENT NEEDS

To succeed on summary judgment, you need to establish facts showing:

### A. For "Parody with Critical Bearing" Argument:
1. **Evidence that Riven's song perpetuates specific historical myths**
   - Expert testimony from historians
   - Educational literature showing song's inaccuracies
   - Evidence students learned false history from the song

2. **Evidence that your criticism targets Riven's work specifically**
   - Your promotional materials emphasizing "correction of [Riven's song]"
   - Pedagogical theory supporting melody-based correction
   - Evidence you couldn't achieve critical purpose without using his melody

### B. For "Different Purpose" Argument:
1. **Riven's actual purpose (if discoverable):**
   - Deposition testimony: "doesn't care about Paul Revere"
   - Original marketing: entertainment, not education
   - Timing: educational licensing came later, not original intent

2. **Your distinct purpose:**
   - Nonprofit formation documents (educational mission)
   - Curriculum materials showing critical thinking pedagogy
   - Pricing structure (below-cost = not commercial)

### C. For "No Market Harm" Argument:
1. **Lack of established educational market:**
   - Discovery: only preliminary talks, no signed deals
   - No evidence Riven actively licenses to schools
   - Education department's actual activities (if any)

2. **No market substitution:**
   - Survey evidence: schools choose EchoCraft for **critical content**, not entertainment value
   - Testimony: schools wouldn't use Riven's song for critical pedagogy purposes
   - Schools that use both: EchoCraft supplements, doesn't substitute

---

**BOTTOM LINE:** The legal tests are clear, but fact-intensive. Your success hinges on:
1. Proving "critical bearing" on Riven's work (not just history)
2. Demonstrating functionally distinct purpose (critical pedagogy vs. entertainment)
3. Showing no established educational market + no market substitution

The "bendy parts" give you room to argue, but you need **specific facts** matching the legal tests. Discovery and summary judgment briefing are where this battle will be won or lost.
