**Synopsis**

**Background:** Comedians\' heirs brought copyright infringement action
against producers of theatrical production based on comedians\' "Who\'s
On First?" routine. The United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, [George B. Daniels](), J., [151 F.Supp.3d 419](),
granted producers\' motion to dismiss. Heirs appealed.

 

**Holdings:** The Court of Appeals, [Reena Raggi](), Circuit Judge, held
that:

 

[^\[1\]^](#co_anchor_F62039977848_1) purpose and character of use factor
weighed against fair use defense;

 

[^\[2\]^](#co_anchor_F102039977848_1) nature of copyrighted work factor
weighed against fair use defense;

 

[^\[3\]^](#co_anchor_F122039977848_1) amount and substantiality of use
factor weighed against fair use defense;

 

[^\[4\]^](#co_anchor_F172039977848_1) factor considering effect of use
on potential market for copyrighted work weighed against fair use
defense;

 

[^\[5\]^](#co_anchor_F202039977848_1) heirs failed to plausibly allege a
valid copyright interest in "Who\'s On First?" routine based on contract
in which comedians agreed to license use of comedy routines to film
production company for use in movies;

 

[^\[6\]^](#co_anchor_F242039977848_1) heirs failed to plausibly allege a
valid copyright interest in "Who\'s On First?" routine based on
work-for-hire agreements; and

 

[^\[7\]^](#co_anchor_F252039977848_1) heirs failed to plausibly allege a
valid copyright interest in "Who\'s On First?" routine based on
allegations that routine merged into film production company\'s movies
so as to avoid the need for creators to renew the copyright.

 

Affirmed as modified.

 

**Procedural Posture(s):** On Appeal; Motion to Dismiss; Motion to
Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim.

**\*171** Appeal from the Southern District of New York

**Attorneys and Law Firms**

[Jonathan D. Reichman]() ([Jonathan W. Thomas](), on the brief), Kenyon
& Kenyon LLP, New York, New York, for Plaintiffs--Appellants.

[Mark J. Lawless](), Law Office of Mark J. Lawless, New York, New York,
for Defendants--Appellees.

**\*172** Before: [Jacobs](), [Calabresi](), [Raggi](), Circuit Judges.

**Opinion**

[Reena Raggi](), Circuit Judge:

In this action for copyright infringement, plaintiffs,
successors-in-interest to the estates of William "Bud" Abbott and Lou
Costello, appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (George B.
Daniels, Jr., *Judge* ) in favor of defendants, who include the
producers of [Hand to God]{.underline} and the play\'s author, Robert
Askins. [See]{.underline} [[TCA Television Corp. v.
McCollum]{.underline}, 151 F.Supp.3d 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2015)](). Plaintiffs
assert that the district court erred in concluding from the amended
complaint that defendants' use of a portion of the iconic Abbott and
Costello comedy routine, [Who\'s on First?]{.underline}, in Act I of
[Hand to God]{.underline} was so transformative as to establish
defendants' fair use defense as a matter of law. [See]{.underline} [Fed.
R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)](). Defendants here not only defend the district
court\'s fair use determination but also argue that affirmance is
warranted, in any event, by plaintiffs' failure to plead a valid
copyright interest. The district court rejected that argument.
[See]{.underline} [[TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum]{.underline}, 151
F.Supp.3d at 430--31]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00012039977848_ID0EDMAI_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00012039977848_1)

 

For the reasons explained herein, we conclude that defendants' verbatim
incorporation of more than a minute of the [Who\'s on
First?]{.underline} routine in their commercial production was not a
fair use of the material. Nevertheless, we affirm dismissal because
plaintiffs fail plausibly to allege a valid copyright interest.

 

**I. [Background]{.underline}**

The following facts derive from plaintiffs' amended complaint,
incorporated exhibits, and documents susceptible to judicial notice.
[See]{.underline} [[Goel v. Bunge, Ltd.]{.underline}, 820 F.3d 554, 559
(2d Cir. 2016)]() (acknowledging that, on motion to dismiss, courts may
consider documents appended to or incorporated in complaint and matters
of which judicial notice may be taken); [[Island Software & Comput.
Serv., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.]{.underline}, 413 F.3d 257, 261 (2d Cir.
2005)]() (stating that court may take judicial notice of copyright
registrations). For purposes of this appeal, we presume these facts to
be true. [See]{.underline} [[Anschutz Corp. v. Merrill Lynch &
Co.]{.underline}, 690 F.3d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 2012)]().

 

> A. [Abbott and Costello\'s *Who\'s on First?* Routine]{.underline}

Abbott and Costello were a popular mid-Twentieth Century comedy duo. One
of their routines, commonly referred to as [Who\'s on
First?]{.underline} (also, the "Routine"), has become a treasured piece
of American entertainment
history.[]{#co_fnRef_B00022039977848_ID0EERAI_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00022039977848_1) The Routine\'s humor
derives from misunderstandings that arise when Abbott announces the
roster of a baseball team filled with such oddly named players as "Who,"
"What," and "I Don\'t Know." A rapid-fire exchange reveals that "who\'s
on first" need not be a question. It can be a statement of fact,
[i.e.]{.underline}, a player named "Who" is the first baseman. Later
parts of the routine reveal, after similar comic misunderstandings, that
a player **\*173** named "What" is the second baseman, and one named "I
Don\'t Know" is the third baseman.

 

> B. [Agreements Pertaining to Rights in the Routine]{.underline}

The parties cite various contracts and copyright filings spanning more
than 40 years as relevant to claimed rights in the Routine.

 

1\. [Abbott and Costello\'s Agreements with UPC]{.underline}

a\. [The July 1940 Agreement]{.underline}

Abbott and Costello first performed [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} in
the late 1930s, notably on a 1938 live radio broadcast of [The Kate
Smith Hour]{.underline}. The Routine was published for purposes of
federal copyright law when Abbott and Costello performed a version of it
in their first motion picture, [One Night in the Tropics]{.underline}
("[Tropics]{.underline}").[]{#co_fnRef_B00032039977848_ID0EYUAI_1
.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00032039977848_1)

 

The team appeared in [Tropics]{.underline} pursuant to a July 24, 1940
contract (the "July Agreement") with Universal Pictures Company, Inc.
("UPC"). The July Agreement guaranteed Abbott and Costello a minimum of
five weeks' work at a pay rate of \$3,500 per week. In turn, Abbott and
Costello (the "Artists") agreed to grant UPC (the "Producer") certain
rights and to furnish it with certain items. We reproduce the relevant
text here, adding bracketed signals and highlighting to distinguish
various provisions:

> \[1\] The Artists expressly give and [grant]{.underline} to the
> Producer the sole and exclusive right to photograph and/or otherwise
> reproduce any and all of their acts, poses, plays and appearances of
> any and all kinds during the term hereof, and \[2\] further agree
> \[a\] to [furnish]{.underline} to the Producer, without charge to it,
> the material and routines heretofore used and now owned by the Artists
> for use by the Producer in the photoplay in which they appear
> hereunder and for which the Producer shall have the exclusive motion
> picture rights, and \[b\] to record their voices and all instrumental,
> musical and other sound effects produced by them, and \[c\] to
> reproduce and/or transmit the same, either separately or in
> conjunction with such acts, poses, plays and appearances as the
> Producer may desire, and further \[3\] give and [grant]{.underline} to
> the Producer solely and exclusively all rights of every kind and
> character whatsoever in and to the same, or any of them, perpetually,
> including as well the perpetual right to use the names of the Artists
> and pictures or other reproductions of the Artists' physical
> likenesses, and recordations and reproductions of the Artists' voices,
> in connection with the advertising and exploitation thereof.

J.A. 168--69.

 

b\. [The November 1940 Agreement]{.underline}

On November 6, 1940, only days before [Tropics]{.underline}'s public
release, Abbott and Costello entered into a new multi-year/multi-picture
agreement with UPC (the "November
Agreement").[]{#co_fnRef_B00042039977848_ID0ECYAI_1
.anchor}[^4^](#co_footnote_B00042039977848_1) That contract terminated
**\*174** the July Agreement without prejudice to, among other things,
UPC\'s "ownership \... of all rights heretofore acquired," including
those "in or to any \... material furnished or supplied by the Artists."
[Id.]{.underline} at 162. In the November Agreement, Abbott and Costello
agreed "to furnish and make available to the Producer all literary and
dramatic material and routines heretofore used by the Artists either on
the radio or otherwise and now owned by the Artists," and acknowledged
that "the Producer shall have the right to use said material and
routines to such extent as the Producer may desire in connection with
any photoplay in which the Artists render their services hereunder and
in connection with the advertising and exploitation of such photoplay."
[Id.]{.underline} at 129. Abbott and Costello agreed that they would
"not use or license, authorize or permit the use of any of the material
and/or routines" so referenced "in connection with motion pictures" by
others than UPC for specified times. [Id.]{.underline} Nevertheless,
they reserved the right to use materials and routines created by them
(without the assistance of UPC writers) "on the radio and in personal
appearances." [Id.]{.underline} at 129--30.

 

2\. [UPC Registers a Copyright for *Tropics*]{.underline}

In November 1940, UPC registered a copyright for [Tropics]{.underline}
with the United States Copyright Office, which it renewed in December
1967. [See]{.underline} [id.]{.underline} at 36, 39--40.

 

3\. [UPC Uses an Expanded Version of the Routine in *The Naughty*
*Nineties* and Registers a Copyright for that Movie]{.underline}

In 1945, Abbott and Costello performed an expanded version of [Who\'s on
First?]{.underline} in another movie for UPC, [The Naughty
Nineties]{.underline}. That version maintains the core of the
Routine---with "Who" on first base, "What" on second, and "I Don\'t
Know" on third---but several new players take the field: left fielder
"Why," center fielder "Because," pitcher "Tomorrow," catcher "Today,"
and shortstop "I Don\'t Care."

 

In June 1945, UPC registered a copyright for [The Naughty
Nineties]{.underline} with the United States Copyright Office, which it
renewed in 1972. [See]{.underline} [id.]{.underline} at 37, 41--42; Am.
Compl. ¶ 45.[]{#co_fnRef_B00052039977848_ID0E66AI_1
.anchor}[^5^](#co_footnote_B00052039977848_1)

 

4\. [The 1944 Copyright Registration for "Abbott and Costello Baseball
Routine"]{.underline}

In April 1944, a work entitled "Abbott and Costello Baseball Routine"
was registered with the Copyright Office "in the name of Bud Abbott and
Lou Costello, c/o Writers War Board." J.A. 114. The certificate
indicates that this "Baseball Routine" was published on "March 13, 1944"
in " '[Soldier Shows]{.underline},' No. 19."
[Id.]{.underline}[]{#co_fnRef_B00062039977848_ID0E1CBI_1
.anchor}[^6^](#co_footnote_B00062039977848_1) The record **\*175**
suggests that this registration was not renewed, prompting the Copyright
Office to conclude that the work had entered the public domain in 1972,
and, on that ground, to reject a 1984 application for a derivative work
registration filed by the children of Abbott and Costello based on the
1944 registration.

 

5\. [The 1984 Quitclaim Agreement]{.underline}

Plaintiffs do not rely on the 1944 registration to support their
copyright claim here. Rather, they claim to have succeeded to UPC\'s
copyright interests in the Routine as performed in [Tropics]{.underline}
and [The Naughty Nineties]{.underline} based on a quitclaim agreement
dated March 12, 1984 (the "Quitclaim").

 

In the Quitclaim, which was subsequently recorded with the Copyright
Office, UPC\'s successor-in-interest, Universal Pictures ("Universal"),
granted Abbott & Costello Enterprises ("A & C"), a partnership formed by
the heirs of Abbott and Costello,[]{#co_fnRef_B00072039977848_ID0EGFBI_1
.anchor}[^7^](#co_footnote_B00072039977848_1) "any and all" of
Universal\'s rights, title, and interest in the Routine.
[Id.]{.underline} at 45. Universal stated that it did so relying upon A
& C\'s representation that it was "a partnership composed of the
successors in interest to the late Bud Abbott and Lou Costello" and,
therefore, "the owner of copyright in and to the Routine." Id. at 46.

 

A & C dissolved in 1992, with 50% of its assets transferred to TCA
Television Corporation, a California entity owned by Lou Costello\'s
heirs, and the other 50% divided evenly between Bud Abbott\'s heirs,
Vickie Abbott Wheeler and Bud Abbott, Jr. Wheeler would later transfer
her 25% interest to a California partnership, Hi Neighbor, and Abbott,
Jr. would transfer his 25% interest to Diana Abbott Colton. It is by
operation of the Quitclaim and the referenced dissolution and transfer
agreements that plaintiffs TCA Television, Hi Neighbor, and Colton now
claim a copyright interest in [Who\'s on First?]{.underline}.

 

> C. *[Hand to God]{.underline}*

As described in the amended complaint, [Hand to God]{.underline} (the
"Play") is "a dark comedy about an introverted student in religious,
small-town Texas who finds a creative outlet and a means of
communication through a hand puppet, wh\[ich\] turns into his evil or
devilish persona." Am. Compl. ¶ 58. After two successful off-Broadway
runs, [Hand to God]{.underline} opened to critical acclaim on Broadway
in the spring of 2015. Through press coverage, plaintiffs learned that
[Hand to God]{.underline} incorporated part of the Routine in one of its
"key scene\[s\]," without license or permission. [Id.]{.underline} at ¶
63. While the Play was still in previews for its Broadway opening,
plaintiffs sent defendants a cease and desist letter. Defendants'
failure to comply with that request prompted this lawsuit.

 

1\. [The Relevant Scene]{.underline}

Plaintiffs allege that the Play infringes their copyright in the Routine
by using its first part---that is, the part pertaining to first baseman
"Who"---in Act I, Scene 2. In that scene, which occurs approximately 15
minutes into the Play, the lead character, "Jason," and the girl with
whom he is smitten, "Jessica," have just emerged from the basement of
their church, where they had been participating in a Christian puppet
workshop. Jason tries to impress Jessica by using his sock puppet,
"Tyrone," to **\*176** perform, almost verbatim, a little over a minute
of [Who\'s on First?]{.underline}. Jason plays the Bud Abbott role,
while Tyrone assumes Lou Costello\'s
character.[]{#co_fnRef_B00082039977848_ID0E2KBI_1
.anchor}[^8^](#co_footnote_B00082039977848_1)

 

When Jason somewhat bashfully concludes the "Who" part of the Routine,
Jessica compliments him by saying, "That\'s really good," and asks, "Did
you come up with that all by yourself\[?\]" Suppl. App\'x 21. When Jason
answers, "Yes," the audience laughs at what it recognizes as a lie.
[Id.]{.underline}; [see]{.underline} Am. Compl. ¶ 64. The answer,
however, triggers a different response from the puppet, which, seemingly
of its own volition, calls Jason a "Liar," and states that the comic
exchange they just performed is "a famous routine from the \[F\]ifties."
Suppl. App\'x 21. Jason corrects Tyrone, stating that the sketch is from
the "Forties." [Id.]{.underline} Tyrone then insults Jessica, telling
her that she would know the Routine\'s origin if she "weren\'t so
stupid." [Id.]{.underline} Jason and Jessica each order Tyrone to "shut
up" to no effect. [Id.]{.underline} at 22. Instead, as the scene
continues, Tyrone vulgarly divulges Jason\'s physical desire for
Jessica. Only after a seeming physical struggle with Tyrone is Jason
able to remove the puppet from his hand and thereby end Tyrone\'s
outburst. Jason tries to apologize to Jessica, but she quickly exits,
leaving Jason---in the words of the stage direction---"\[d\]efeated
**\*177** by what he ca\[ \]n\'t defeat." [Id.]{.underline} at 24.

 

The scene foreshadows darker and more disturbing exchanges between Jason
and the puppet that will occur as the Play proceeds.

 

2\. [Promotional Materials]{.underline}

Plaintiffs allege that, in online promotional materials for the Play,
defendants used a "video clip" of Jason and his puppet performing
[Who\'s on First?]{.underline} to "stoke interest" in and sell tickets
for the Play. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 69, 89. These promotional materials are not
part of the court record.

 

> D. [District Court Proceedings]{.underline}

On June 4, 2015, plaintiffs filed this action in the Southern District
of New York, claiming both federal and common law copyright
infringement. Defendants promptly moved to dismiss, arguing, [inter
alia]{.underline}, that (1) plaintiffs did not hold a valid copyright;
(2) the Routine was in the public domain; and (3) [Hand to
God]{.underline}'s incorporation of the Routine was sufficiently
transformative to qualify as a permissible fair use, not prohibited
infringement.

 

On December 17, 2015, the district court granted defendants' motion to
dismiss. It declined to do so on either of the first two grounds argued
by defendants, concluding that, at the 12(b)(6) stage, plaintiffs had
"sufficiently alleged a continuous chain of title" to the Routine to
survive dismissal. [[TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum]{.underline}, 151
F.Supp.3d at 431](). Instead, the court concluded that dismissal was
warranted because defendants' use of [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} in
[Hand to God]{.underline} was "highly transformative" and a
non-infringing fair use. [[Id.]{.underline} at 434, 437]().

 

This appeal followed.

 

**[II. Discussion]{.underline}**

> A. [Dismissal Was Not Properly Based on Fair Use]{.underline}

1\. [Standard of Review]{.underline}

[**^\[1\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F12039977848_1)We review [de
novo]{.underline} a judgment of dismissal under [Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(b)(6)](), accepting all factual allegations in the amended complaint
and its incorporated exhibits as true and drawing all reasonable
inferences in plaintiffs' favor. [See]{.underline} [[Concord Assocs.,
L.P. v. Entm\'t Props. Tr.]{.underline}, 817 F.3d 46, 52 (2d Cir.
2016)](). The challenged dismissal here is based on the district
court\'s determination that plaintiffs could not succeed on their
copyright infringement claim because the [Rule 12(b)(6)]() record
established defendants' fair use defense as a matter of law.

 

[**^\[2\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F22039977848_1)
[**^\[3\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F32039977848_1)Our review of that decision
is necessarily informed by certain basic copyright principles. First,
the law affords copyright protection to promote not simply individual
interests, but---in the words of the Constitution---"the progress of
science and useful arts" for the benefit of society as a whole. [U.S.
Const. art I, § 8, cl. 8](). As the Supreme Court has explained,
copyright protection is based on the "economic philosophy \... that
encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to
advance public welfare." [[Mazer v. Stein]{.underline}, 347 U.S. 201,
219, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954)](). In short, the "monopoly
created by copyright \... rewards the individual author," but only "in
order to benefit the public." [[Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enters.]{.underline}, 471 U.S. 539, 546, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588
(1985)]() (internal quotation marks omitted); [see]{.underline} [[Fox
Film Corp. v. Doyal]{.underline}, 286 U.S. 123, 127, 52 S.Ct. 546, 76
L.Ed. 1010 (1932)]() ("The sole interest of the United States and the
primary object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits
derived by the public from the labors of authors.").

 

**\*178** [**^\[4\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F42039977848_1)Second, and
consistent with this public purpose, the law has long recognized that
"some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials" is necessary to
promote progress in science and art. [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music,
Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. 569, 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994)](); [[Iowa State Univ. Research Found., Inc. v. Am. Broad.
Cos.]{.underline}, 621 F.2d 57, 60 (2d Cir. 1980)]() (stating that fair
use doctrine "permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright
statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity which
that law is designed to foster"). The doctrine of fair use, derived from
common law, is now codified in the Copyright Act of 1976, [Pub. L. No.
94--553, 90 Stat. 2541.]() [See]{.underline} [17 U.S.C. § 107](). That
codification does not so much define "fair use" as provide a
non-exhaustive list of factors to guide courts' fair use determinations.
This affords the doctrine a certain "malleability" that can challenge
judicial application. 4 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, [Nimmer on
Copyright]{.underline} (hereinafter "Nimmer") § 13.05, at 13--156
(Matthew Bender, rev. ed., 2016).

 

Courts most frequently address a proffered fair use defense at summary
judgment. [See, e.g.]{.underline}, [[Blanch v. Koons]{.underline}, 467
F.3d 244, 250 (2d Cir. 2006)]() (explaining that court may resolve fair
use question at summary judgment if there are no genuine issues of
fact); [see also]{.underline} [[Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enters.]{.underline}, 471 U.S. at 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218]() (stating that
appeals court may decide fair use where "district court has found facts
sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors"). Nevertheless,
this court has acknowledged the possibility of fair use being so clearly
established by a complaint as to support dismissal of a copyright
infringement claim. [See]{.underline} [[Cariou v. Prince]{.underline},
714 F.3d 694, 707 (2d Cir. 2013)]() (granting defendant partial summary
judgment on fair use and citing approvingly to [[Brownmark Films, LLC v.
Comedy Partners]{.underline}, 682 F.3d 687 (7th Cir. 2012)]() (rejecting
argument that fair use could not be decided on motion to dismiss)).

 

On [de novo]{.underline} review here, we conclude that defendants'
entitlement to a fair use defense was not so clearly established on the
face of the amended complaint and its incorporated exhibits as to
support dismissal.

 

2\. [The Statutory Framework for Analyzing Fair Use]{.underline}

In the preamble to [17 U.S.C. § 107](), Congress states that "the fair
use of a copyrighted work \... for purposes such as criticism, comment,
news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
scholarship, or research is not an infringement of copyright." As the
words "such as" indicate, the listing is "illustrative and not
limitative." [17 U.S.C. § 101](); [see]{.underline} [[Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.]{.underline}, 471 U.S. at 561, 105
S.Ct. 2218](). Four nonexclusive factors---incorporating common law
traditions---are properly considered in "determining whether the use
made of a work in any particular case is a fair use." [17 U.S.C. §
107](). These statutory factors are as follows:

> \(1\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
> is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
>
> \(2\) the nature of the copyrighted work;
>
> \(3\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
> the copyrighted work as a whole; and
>
> \(4\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
> the copyrighted work.

[[Id.]{.underline}](); [see generally]{.underline} [[Folsom v.
Marsh]{.underline}, 9 F.Cas. 342, 348 (C.C.D. Mass. 1841)]() (Story, J.)
(explaining that common law courts **\*179** "deciding questions of this
sort" should "look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the
quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the
use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the
objects, of the original work").

 

[**^\[5\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F52039977848_1)In reviewing the challenged
determination of fair use in this case, we necessarily discuss these
factors individually, at the same time that we heed the Supreme Court\'s
instruction that the factors must be viewed collectively, with their
results "weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."
[[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music, Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 578, 114
S.Ct. 1164]().

 

a\. [Purpose and Character of the Use]{.underline}

\(1\) [Transformative Use]{.underline}

[**^\[6\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F62039977848_1)The first statutory fair use
factor considers the purpose and character of the secondary use. In this
regard, the uses identified by Congress in the preamble to §
107---criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and
research---might be deemed "most appropriate" for a purpose or character
finding indicative of fair use. Nimmer § 13.05\[A\]\[1\]\[a\], at
13--162; [see]{.underline} [[Authors]{.underline} [Guild v. Google,
Inc.]{.underline}, 804 F.3d 202, 215 (2d Cir. 2015)]() (noting that
providing commentary or criticism on another\'s work is "\[a\]mong the
best recognized justifications for copying").

 

The challenged use here does not appear to fit within any of these
statutory categories. Nevertheless, the district court concluded that
defendants' use was "transformative," indeed, so "highly transformative"
as to be "determinative" of fair use. [[TCA Television Corp. v.
McCollum]{.underline}, 151 F.Supp.3d at 434--35](). The district court
explained that by having a single character perform the Routine, the
Play\'s authors were able to contrast "Jason\'s seemingly soft-spoken
personality and the actual outrageousness of his inner nature, which he
expresses through the sock puppet." [[Id.]{.underline} at 436](). This
contrast was "a darkly comedic critique of the social norms governing a
small town in the Bible Belt." [[Id.]{.underline}]() This reasoning is
flawed in that what it identifies are the general artistic and critical
purpose and character of [the Play]{.underline}. The district court did
not explain how defendants' extensive copying of a famous comedy routine
was necessary to this purpose, much less how the character of the
[Routine]{.underline} was transformed by defendants' use.

 

[**^\[7\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F72039977848_1)
[**^\[8\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F82039977848_1)The Supreme Court has stated
that "the goal of copyright \... is generally furthered by the creation
of transformative works." [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music,
Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00092039977848_ID0EL5CI_1
.anchor}[^9^](#co_footnote_B00092039977848_1) But **\*180** how does a
court decide "whether and to what extent the new work is
'transformative' "? [[Id.]{.underline}]() [[Campbell]{.underline}]()
instructs that a court properly considers "whether the new work merely
supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead [adds
something new]{.underline}, [with a further purpose or different
character]{.underline}, [altering the first with new expression,
meaning, or message]{.underline}." [[Id.]{.underline}]() (emphases
added) (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).

 

[**^\[9\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F92039977848_1)As the highlighted language
indicates, the focus of inquiry is not simply on the new work,
[i.e.]{.underline}, on whether that work serves a purpose or conveys an
overall expression, meaning, or message different from the copyrighted
material it appropriates. Rather, the critical inquiry is whether the
new work uses the copyrighted material itself for a purpose, or imbues
it with a character, different from that for which it was created.
[See]{.underline} [[id.]{.underline}]() Otherwise, any play that needed
a character to sing a song, tell a joke, or recite a poem could use
unaltered copyrighted material with impunity, so long as the purpose or
message of the play was different from that of the appropriated
material.

 

In sum, even if, as the district court concluded, [Hand to
God]{.underline} is a "darkly comedic critique of the social norms
governing a small town in the Bible Belt," [[TCA Television Corp. v.
McCollum]{.underline}, 151 F.Supp.3d at 436](), and even if the Play\'s
purpose and character are completely different from the vaudevillian
humor originally animating [Who\'s on First?]{.underline}, that, by
itself, does not demonstrate that defendants' use of the Routine in the
Play was transformative of the original work.

 

We made this point in [[Cariou v. Prince]{.underline}, 714 F.3d 694]().
There, the defendant, a self-styled "appropriation artist,"
[[id.]{.underline} at 699](), had taken plaintiff\'s copyrighted
photographs---"serene and deliberately composed" portraits of
Rastafarian men---and altered them to create "crude and jarring"
collages, [[id.]{.underline} at 706](). Defendant acknowledged that he
had not used the photographs to "comment on" the original works.
[[Id.]{.underline} at 707](). Instead, both works had an underlying
artistic purpose, but defendant stated that he had sought to change the
original material "into something that\'s completely different."
[[Id.]{.underline}]() (internal quotation marks omitted). Reversing a
district court award of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, this
court ruled that, although commentary frequently constitutes fair use,
it is not essential that a new creative work comment on an incorporated
copyrighted work to be transformative. [See]{.underline}
[[id.]{.underline} at 706]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00102039977848_ID0EHMDI_1
.anchor}[^10^](#co_footnote_B00102039977848_1) Rather, "to qualify as a
fair use" in the absence of such a different purpose, the new work
"generally must alter the original with 'new expression, meaning, or
message.' " [[Id.]{.underline}]() (quoting [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose
Music, Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164]()).[]{#co_fnRef_B00112039977848_ID0EQODI_1
.anchor}[^11^](#co_footnote_B00112039977848_1)

 

**\*181** [[Cariou]{.underline}]() concluded that the challenged
artworks there satisfied this standard because they not only strove for
"new aesthetics with creative and communicative results distinct from"
that of the copyrighted material, but also gave the incorporated
photographs "new expression," thereby admitting a transformative
purpose. [[Id.]{.underline} at 708](). Indeed, where the defendant\'s
use so "heavily obscured and altered" the original photographs as to
make them "barely recognizable" within the new work, the court ruled
that transformative purpose (and ultimately fair use) was established as
a matter of law. [[Id.]{.underline} at 710](). But where lesser changes
retained certain of the original work\'s aesthetics, the court could not
say "for sure" that their incorporation into the defendant\'s works had
"transformed \[the original\] work enough to render it transformative."
[[Id.]{.underline} at 711](). As to those works,
[[Cariou]{.underline}]() remanded for further proceedings.
[[Id.]{.underline}]()

 

Insofar as [[Cariou]{.underline}]() might be thought to represent the
high-water mark of our court\'s recognition of transformative works, it
has drawn some criticism. [See]{.underline} [[Kienitz v. Sconnie Nation
LLC]{.underline}, 766 F.3d 756, 758 (7th Cir. 2014)]() (expressing
skepticism as to [[Cariou]{.underline}'s]() approach and criticizing
reliance on transformativeness as substitute for the statutory factors,
which threatens to override the copyright owner\'s exclusive right to
prepare derivative works); [see also]{.underline} Nimmer §
13.05\[B\]\[6\], at 13.224.20 (stating with respect to
[[Cariou]{.underline}](): "It would seem that the pendulum has swung too
far in the direction of recognizing any alteration as transformative,
such that this doctrine now threatens to swallow fair use. It is
respectfully submitted that a correction is needed in the law."). We
need not defend [[Cariou]{.underline}]() here, however, because our
point is that even scrupulous adherence to that decision does not permit
defendants' use of [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} in [Hand to
God]{.underline} to be held transformative.

 

Far from altering [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} to the point where it
is "barely recognizable" within the Play, [[Cariou v.
Prince]{.underline}, 714 F.3d at 710](), defendants' use appears not to
have altered the Routine at all. The Play may convey a dark critique of
society, but it does not transform Abbott and Costello\'s Routine so
that [it]{.underline} conveys that message. To the contrary, it appears
that the Play specifically has its characters perform [Who\'s on
First?]{.underline} without alteration so that the audience will readily
recognize both the famous Routine and the boy\'s false claim to having
created it. Indeed, it is only after [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} is
performed---at some length, almost verbatim, and with the Play\'s
characters mimicking the original **\*182** timing, tone, and delivery
of Abbott and Costello---that the boy\'s lie about creating the classic
Routine---no part of the Routine---becomes the triggering event for the
puppet to assume an independent persona.

 

Defendants nevertheless maintain that using the Routine for such a
"dramatic," rather than comedic, purpose was transformative. Appellees'
Br. 18 (stating that Play\'s use of Routine was "far cry" from original
"comedy [schtick]{.underline}"). The argument will not bear close
scrutiny. The "dramatic" purpose served by the Routine in the Play
appears to be as a "McGuffin," that is, as a theatrical device that sets
up the plot, but is of little or no significance in
itself.[]{#co_fnRef_B00122039977848_ID0EPFAK_1
.anchor}[^12^](#co_footnote_B00122039977848_1) To advance the plot of
the Play, specifically, to have the puppet Tyrone take on a persona
distinct from that of Jason, defendants needed Jason to lie about
[something]{.underline} and for Tyrone to call him on it. But the
particular subject of the lie---the Routine---appears irrelevant to that
purpose. Such unaltered use of an allegedly copyrighted work, having no
bearing on the original work, requires justification to qualify for a
fair use defense. [See]{.underline} [[Authors Guild v. Google,
Inc.]{.underline}, 804 F.3d at 215]() (stating that "taking from another
author\'s work for the purpose of making points that have no bearing on
the original may well be fair use, but the taker would need to show a
justification").

 

More than the Routine\'s ability to capture audience attention is
necessary to provide such justification. As the Supreme Court has
cautioned, where a secondary use "has no critical bearing on the
substance or style of the original composition, which the alleged
infringer merely uses to get attention \..., the claim to fairness in
borrowing from another\'s work diminishes accordingly (if it does not
vanish)." [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music, Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S.
at 580, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Nor is a different conclusion warranted
because defendants here place the unaltered Routine in a sharply
different context from its original authors. [See]{.underline}
[[id.]{.underline} at 598, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (Kennedy, J., concurring)
(observing that courts should not afford fair use protection to persons
who merely place characters from familiar copyrighted works into novel
or eccentric settings).

 

The fact that, even as a McGuffin, the Routine is quite funny, also
cannot justify its use in the Play. That humor is an achievement of the
Routine\'s creators, not of the playwright who takes advantage of it
without transforming the Routine\'s aesthetic. Moreover, the Play
appropriates the Routine\'s humor not incidentally, but extensively by
having the characters perform some dozen of the original exchanges on
the comic ambiguity of the words "who\'s on first." No new dramatic
purpose was served by so much copying. [Cf.]{.underline} [[Campbell v.
Acuff--Rose Music, Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 589, 114 S.Ct. 1164]()
(concluding that copying of song for parodic purpose was fair where it
was not "excessive" in relation to that purpose as secondary user took
only what was necessary to evoke original). The only purpose served by
the extent of defendants' taking is identically comedic to that of the
original authors, that is, to have two performers expand on a singular
joke in order to generate increasing audience laughter. As this court
has recognized, there is "nothing transformative" about using **\*183**
an original work "in the manner it was made to be" used. [[On Davis v.
Gap, Inc.]{.underline}, 246 F.3d 152, 174 (2d Cir. 2001)]();
[see]{.underline} [[Ringgold v. Black Entm\'t Television,
Inc.]{.underline}, 126 F.3d 70, 79 (2d Cir. 1997)]() (concluding that
purpose factor favored copyright owner where defendant used "work for
precisely a central purpose for which it was created"). Defendants' use
of the Routine, not briefly as the basis for a dramatic lie, but
extensively for its original comedic effect, cannot be deemed
transformative.

 

In sum, nothing in the 12(b)(6) record shows that the Play imbued the
Routine with any new expression, meaning, or message. Nor does any new
dramatic purpose justify defendants' extensive copying of the Routine.
Accordingly, the district court erred both in finding defendants' use of
the Routine transformative and in concluding, on that basis, that a fair
use defense was established as a matter of
law.[]{#co_fnRef_B00132039977848_ID0EGPAK_1
.anchor}[^13^](#co_footnote_B00132039977848_1)

 

\(2\) [Commercial Purpose]{.underline}

The first statutory factor specifically instructs courts to consider
whether copyrighted materials are used for a commercial purpose or for a
nonprofit educational purpose, the former tending "to weigh against a
finding of fair use." [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music,
Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (internal
quotation marks omitted). There is no question here that defendants' use
of [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} in [Hand to God]{.underline} was for a
commercial purpose. Nevertheless, the district court discounted that
fact upon finding the use "highly transformative." [[TCA Television
Corp. v. McCollum]{.underline}, 151 F.Supp.3d at 434--35]();
[see]{.underline} [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music, Inc.]{.underline},
510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (recognizing that "the more
transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other
factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair
use"). Because we here conclude that defendants' use was not
transformative, let alone "highly transformative," we conclude that the
district court erred in discounting [Hand to God]{.underline}'s
commercial character. [See]{.underline} [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music,
Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 579--81, 114 S.Ct.
1164]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00142039977848_ID0EBWAK_1
.anchor}[^14^](#co_footnote_B00142039977848_1)

 

This conclusion applies with particular force here where plaintiffs
allege that defendants not only used an unaltered and appreciable
excerpt of the Routine in a commercial play but also featured the
Routine in the Play\'s advertising, conduct which reasonably qualifies
as commercial exploitation weighing strongly against fair use.
[See]{.underline} [[id.]{.underline} at 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164]()
(observing that use of copyrighted work "to advertise a product, even in
a parody, will be entitled to less indulgence under the first factor of
the fair use enquiry than the sale of a parody for its own sake");
[[American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.]{.underline}, 60 F.3d 913,
922 (2d Cir. 1994)]() (stating that fair use claim will not be sustained
when secondary use can fairly be **\*184** characterized as "commercial
exploitation" (internal quotation marks omitted)); [[Consumers Union of
U.S., Inc. v. Gen. Signal Corp.]{.underline}, 724 F.2d 1044, 1049 (2d
Cir. 1983)]() (observing that some infringement actions involve copying
of creative expression for "purpose of having that precise form of
expression advance someone else\'s commercial interests---for example,
using well-known copyrighted lines to attract attention to an
advertisement"). Indeed, to the extent defendants excessively copied
from the Routine even within the Play, their advertising focus on the
Routine\'s comic exchanges raises particular commercial exploitation
concerns.

 

Thus, defendants' commercial use of the Routine was not transformative.
Rather, it duplicated to a significant degree the comedic purpose of the
original work. As such, the first statutory factor, far from weighing in
defendants' favor, weighs in favor of plaintiffs.

 

b\. [Nature of Copyrighted Work]{.underline}

[**^\[10\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F102039977848_1)
[**^\[11\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F112039977848_1)The second statutory
factor, "the nature of the copyrighted work," also weighs in plaintiffs'
favor. As the Supreme Court has observed, certain "works are closer to
the core of intended copyright protection than others, with the
consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former
works are copied." [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music, Inc.]{.underline},
510 U.S. at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Like the district court, we conclude
that [Who\'s on First?]{.underline}, an original comedy sketch created
for public entertainment, lies at the heart of copyright\'s intended
protection. [See]{.underline} [[id.]{.underline}]() (recognizing that
creative expression created for public dissemination is at core of
"copyright\'s protective purposes"); [[On Davis v. Gap,
Inc.]{.underline}, 246 F.3d at 175]() (concluding that second factor
favored plaintiff because copyrighted work was "in the nature of an
artistic creation"). Thus, while the secondary user of noncreative
information can more readily claim fair use based on the law\'s
recognition of "a greater need to disseminate factual works than works
of fiction or fantasy," [[Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enters.]{.underline}, 471 U.S. at 563, 105 S.Ct. 2218]();
[see]{.underline} [[Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.]{.underline}, 804 F.3d
at 220 & n.21]() (explaining that factual works "often present well
justified fair uses" because "there is often occasion to test the
accuracy of, to rely on, or to repeat their factual propositions," which
"may reasonably require quotation"), the secondary user of a creative
work must justify his use, usually by explaining the functional or
creative rationale behind its quotation, [see]{.underline} Pierre N.
Leval, [[Toward a Fair Use Standard]{.underline}, 103 Harv. L. Rev.
1105, 1113 (1990)]() (explaining that, in considering whether quotation
is fair, courts must consider utility of each challenged passage).

 

Defendants argue that their use was justified by the dramatic need to
use an instantly recognizable "cultural" touchstone in the relevant
scene. Appellees' Br. 15. Defendants do not explain, however, why
Jason\'s lie had to pertain to a cultural touchstone, as opposed to any
obvious tall tale---[e.g.]{.underline}, inventing the Internet,
traveling to Mars, out-swimming Michael Phelps. [See
generally]{.underline} Leval, [[Toward a Fair Use Standard]{.underline},
103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1111]() (observing that court considering fair use
must determine not only if justification for copying exists, but also
"how powerful, or persuasive, is the justification"). But even assuming
defendants' professed dramatic need, they do not explain why the
cultural touchstone had to be the Routine---or even a comedy sketch---as
opposed to some other readily recognizable exchange, including those
already in the public domain. Most troubling, even if defendants could
justify their dramatic need to use a small, identifiable segment of the
Routine, that does not justify having their characters perform,
**\*185** verbatim, some dozen variations on the Routine\'s singular
joke. As already noted, the purpose of such extensive use was to provoke
audience laughter in exactly the same way as the Routine\'s creators had
done.

 

In sum, because defendants' use of the Routine cannot be deemed
transformative, and because the record is devoid of any persuasive
justification for the extent of defendants' use, the creative nature of
the Routine weighs strongly against a fair use defense.

 

c\. [Amount and Substantiality of Use]{.underline}

[**^\[12\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F122039977848_1)
[**^\[13\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F132039977848_1)The third statutory factor
asks whether " 'the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole' \... are reasonable in
relation to the purpose of the copying." [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose
Music, Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (quoting
[17 U.S.C. § 107(3)]()). In assessing this factor, we consider not only
"the quantity of the materials used" but also "their quality and
importance." [[Id.]{.underline} at 587, 114 S.Ct. 1164]();
[see]{.underline} [[Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enters.]{.underline}, 471 U.S. at 565, 105 S.Ct. 2218]() (stating that
"fact that a substantial portion of the infringing work was copied
verbatim is evidence of the qualitative value of the copied material,
both to the originator and to the plagiarist who seeks to profit from
marketing someone else\'s copyrighted expression").

 

While acknowledging that the portion of the Routine used by defendants
was "instantly recognizable" and "more than merely the 'introductory
premise,' " the district court decided---without explanation---that this
factor tipped only "slightly" in plaintiffs' favor in light of
defendants' transformative use. [[TCA Television Corp. v.
McCollum]{.underline}, 151 F.Supp.3d at 434](). We reject the district
court\'s transformative use determination for reasons already explained.
On [de]{.underline} [novo]{.underline} review, we further conclude that
the third statutory factor weighs strongly in favor of plaintiffs.

 

While the portion of the Routine copied by defendants takes less than
two minutes to perform, it plainly reveals the singular joke underlying
the entire Routine: that words understood by one person as a question
can be understood by another as an answer. Moreover, defendants
repeatedly exploit that joke through a dozen variations. This manifests
substantial copying. [See]{.underline} [[Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.
v. Nation Enters.]{.underline}, 471 U.S. at 548, 565--66, 105 S.Ct.
2218]() (concluding that third factor favored plaintiffs where
defendants copied approximately 300 words verbatim in light of
"expressive value of the excerpts"); [[Castle Rock Entm\'t v. Carol
Publ\'g Grp., Inc.]{.underline}, 955 F.Supp. 260, 269 (S.D.N.Y. 1997)]()

copying even few words of challenged work can constitute substantial

[**^\[14\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F142039977848_1)Even a substantial taking,
however, can constitute fair use if justified. [See]{.underline}

of copyrighted work); [see also]{.underline} Leval, [[Toward a Fair Use
Standard]{.underline}, 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1123]() (explaining that,
under third factor, "an important inquiry is whether the selection and
quantity of the material taken are reasonable in relation to the
purported justification"). But, as already explained, defendants offer
no persuasive justification for their extensive use of the Routine.

**\*186** d. [Effect on Potential Market for Copyrighted
Work]{.underline}

[**^\[15\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F152039977848_1)
[**^\[16\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F162039977848_1)The final statutory factor
considers "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value
of the copyrighted work," [17 U.S.C. § 107(4)](), focusing on whether
the secondary use usurps demand for the protected work by serving as a
market substitute, [see]{.underline} [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose Music,
Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (stating that role
of courts is to distinguish between "biting criticism that merely
suppresses demand and copyright infringement, which usurps it"
(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)). In weighing this
factor, a court properly looks to "not only the extent of market harm
caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also
whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by
the defendant would result in a substantially adverse impact on the
potential market for the original." [[Id.]{.underline} at 590, 114 S.Ct.
1164]() (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).

 

[**^\[17\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F172039977848_1)The district court weighed
this factor in defendants' favor, concluding that the Play\'s use of the
Routine could not reasonably be expected to usurp the market for Abbott
and Costello\'s original performance. [See]{.underline} [[TCA Television
Corp. v. McCollum]{.underline}, 151 F.Supp.3d at 434--35](). In so
doing, however, the district court disregarded the possibility of
defendants' use adversely affecting the licensing market for the
Routine. [See]{.underline} [[id.]{.underline} at 434]() (citing [[Cariou
v. Prince]{.underline}, 714 F.3d at 708]() (stating that fourth factor
"does not focus principally on the question of damage to \[a\]
derivative market")).

 

[**^\[18\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F182039977848_1)While derivative markets
are not the principal focus of the fourth inquiry, that does not mean
that they are irrelevant. [See]{.underline} [[Campbell v. Acuff--Rose
Music, Inc.]{.underline}, 510 U.S. at 593, 114 S.Ct. 1164]()
(recognizing that evidence of substantial harm to derivative market
would weigh against fair use). A court considering fair use properly
identifies and weighs relevant harm to the derivative market for a
copyrighted work, which market includes uses that creators of original
works might "license others to develop." [[Id.]{.underline} at 592, 114
S.Ct. 1164](); [see]{.underline} [[American Geophysical Union v. Texaco
Inc.]{.underline}, 60 F.3d at 929]() ("\[T\]he impact on potential
licensing revenues is a proper subject for consideration in assessing
the fourth factor.").

 

[**^\[19\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F192039977848_1)To be clear, in assessing
harm posed to a licensing market, a court\'s focus is not on possible
lost licensing fees from defendants' challenged use. [See]{.underline}
[[American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.]{.underline}, 60 F.3d at 929
n.17]() (explaining that fourth factor would always favor copyright
owner if courts focused on loss of potential licensing fees from alleged

Standard]{.underline}, 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1124]() ("By definition
every fair use involves some loss of royalty revenue because the
secondary user has not paid royalties."). Rather, a court properly
considers the challenged use\'s "impact on potential licensing revenues
for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets."
[[American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.]{.underline}, 60 F.3d at
930](); [accord]{.underline} [[Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v.
Bloomberg L.P.]{.underline}, 756 F.3d 73, 91 (2d Cir. 2014)]().

 

Plaintiffs here alleged the existence of a traditional---and
active---derivative market for licensing the Routine. [See]{.underline}
Am. Compl. ¶¶ 40, 81--83 (alleging that plaintiffs receive "regular"
requests to license [Who\'s on First?]{.underline}, which they
frequently grant). Further, they alleged market harm. [See]{.underline}
[id.]{.underline} at ¶ 83 (alleging that defendants' unlicensed use of
[Who\'s on First?]{.underline} negatively affected commercial market for
future licensing). Accepting these allegations as true at this **\*187**
stage of the litigation, we conclude that this factor weighs in favor of
plaintiffs. [See]{.underline} [[On Davis v. Gap, Inc.]{.underline}, 246
F.3d at 175--76]() (concluding that fourth factor favored copyright
owner where defendants' taking caused both loss of royalty revenue and
"diminution of \[owner\'s\] opportunity to license to others who might
regard \[owner\'s\] design as preempted by \[defendant\'s\] ad").

 

In sum, on the 12(b)(6) record, all four statutory factors weigh in
favor of plaintiffs and against a defense of fair use. Because, at this
stage of the proceeding, defendants have identified no other equitable
factors as here relevant to the fair use analysis, we conclude that the
dismissal of plaintiffs' amended complaint on the ground of fair use was
error. Nevertheless, for reasons explained in the next section of the
opinion, we conclude that dismissal was warranted because plaintiffs did
not plausibly allege a valid copyright interest in the Routine.

 

B. [Dismissal for Failure To Plead a Valid Copyright]{.underline}

Defendants argue that, even if we reject dismissal on the basis of a
fair use defense, we should affirm because plaintiffs fail plausibly to
plead ownership of a valid copyright in the Routine. [See]{.underline}
[[Feist Publ\'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.]{.underline}, 499 U.S.
340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991)]() (identifying two
elements of infringement: (1) ownership of valid copyright and (2)
copying original elements of work). Defendants assert that Abbott and
Costello\'s [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} Routine fell into the public
domain in 1968, when the initial copyright term for
[Tropics]{.underline} expired. Defendants concede that UPC\'s
registration for that movie protected the Routine---first published
therein---from entering the public domain through the term of that
copyright, [see]{.underline} [[Shoptalk, Ltd. v. Concorde--New Horizons
Corp.]{.underline}, 168 F.3d 586, 592 (2d Cir. 1999)](), but they assert
that only Abbott and Costello, as the Routine\'s authors, could renew
the copyright in that work---as distinct from
[Tropics]{.underline}---which the team failed to
do.[]{#co_fnRef_B00152039977848_ID0ETDCK_1
.anchor}[^15^](#co_footnote_B00152039977848_1)

 

In disputing this challenge, plaintiffs argue that UPC had the right to
renew the copyright in the Routine because (1) Abbott and Costello
assigned ownership of their common law copyright in the Routine to UPC
in either the July or November Agreement, (2) the Routine as published
in [Tropics]{.underline} was a "work for hire" owned by UPC, and (3) the
Routine merged into [Tropics]{.underline} so as to support a single
copyright. Plaintiffs maintain that, under any of these theories, UPC\'s
renewal of the [Tropics]{.underline} copyright also maintained copyright
protection for the Routine, so that they now hold a valid copyright in
that work by virtue of UPC\'s transfer of its rights in the Routine in
the Quitclaim.

 

We identify no merit in any of the theories relied on by plaintiffs to
support their copyright claim and, accordingly, we affirm dismissal of
the amended complaint for failure to plead a valid copyright.

 

> 1\. [Copyright Assignment]{.underline}

[**^\[20\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F202039977848_1)In rejecting defendants'
copyright invalidity challenge, the district court thought that "\[t\]he
contract language, together with UPC\'s subsequent registration
**\*188** of the copyrights" for [Tropics]{.underline} and [The Naughty
Nineties]{.underline}, might admit a finding of "implied assignment of
the initial copyright from Abbott and Costello." [[TCA Television Corp.
v. McCollum]{.underline}, 151 F.Supp.3d at 429](); [see]{.underline}
Nimmer § 10.03\[B\]\[2\], at 10--56.2(6) (explaining that pre-1978
assignment of common law copyright could be effectuated orally or
implied from conduct). The conclusion is flawed in two respects. First,
as detailed in this section, the July and November Agreements clearly
express the parties' intent for Abbott and Costello to license the use
of, not to assign copyrights in, their existing comedy routines for use
in UPC movies in which the team appeared. Second, and requiring no
further discussion in the face of clear contract language, UPC\'s
registration (and renewal) of copyrights in its movies says nothing
about what Abbott and Costello intended to convey in the two agreements
because UPC would have taken such action to protect its independent
movie rights in any event. [See generally]{.underline} [[Faulkner v.
Nat\'l Geographic Soc\'y]{.underline}, 220 F.Supp.2d 237, 239 (S.D.N.Y.
2002)]() (noting that under 1909 Copyright Act, proprietor of collective
work had right to renew copyright in collective work itself).

[**^\[23\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F232039977848_1)Turning then to the
agreements, we note at the outset that neither contract has a choice of
law provision. Thus, the controlling law would be the contract\'s
"center of gravity," which typically is the place of contracting or
performance. [[Lazard Freres & Co. v. Protective Life Ins.
Co.]{.underline}, 108 F.3d 1531, 1539 (2d Cir. 1997)]() (internal
quotation marks omitted). The July Agreement was executed in New York
with expected performance in California. The November Agreement was also
to be performed in California and may have been executed there, where
UPC was located and Abbott and Costello were then completing
[Tropics]{.underline}. Any uncertainty on the latter point is
irrelevant, however, because New York and California law both instruct
that contracts must be interpreted according to the mutual intent of the
parties at the time the contract was formed. [See]{.underline}
[[Welsbach Elec. Corp. v. MasTec N. Am., Inc.]{.underline}, 7 N.Y.3d
624, 629, 825 N.Y.S.2d 692, 695, 859 N.E.2d 498 (2006)](); [[AIU Ins.
Co. v. Superior Court]{.underline}, 51 Cal.3d 807, 821, 274 Cal.Rptr.
820, 799 P.2d 1253, 1264 (1990)](). Both states recognize that the best
evidence of the parties' intent is the language used in their contract.
[See]{.underline} [[Brad H. v. City of New York]{.underline}, 17 N.Y.3d
180, 185, 928 N.Y.S.2d 221, 224, 951 N.E.2d 743 (2011)](); [[AIU Ins.
Co. v. Superior Court]{.underline}, 51 Cal.3d at 822, 274 Cal.Rptr. 820,
799 P.2d at 1264](). Thus, where contract language is clear and
unambiguous, courts will enforce an agreement according to its terms,
without looking outside the four corners of the document.
[See]{.underline} [[Brad H. v. City of New York]{.underline}, 17 N.Y.3d
at 185, 928 N.Y.S.2d at 224, 951 N.E.2d 743](); [[AIU Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court]{.underline}, 51 Cal.3d at 822, 274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799
P.2d at 1264]().

 

The July Agreement employing Abbott and Costello for "one feature
photoplay," J.A. 165, states that the team would furnish UPC with
"routines heretofore used and now owned by Artists [for use by the
Producer in the photoplay in which they appear]{.underline} hereunder
and for which the Producer shall have the [exclusive motion picture
rights]{.underline}," [id.]{.underline} at 169 (emphases added). The
longer-term November Agreement similarly states that the team would
furnish UPC with all "routines heretofore used by the Artists either on
the radio or otherwise and now owned by the Artists," and that UPC would
"have the right to use said material and routines [to such
extent]{.underline} as the Producer may desire [in connection with any
photoplay in which the Artists render their services
hereunder]{.underline}." [Id.]{.underline} at 129 (emphases added). As
the highlighted **\*189** language in each agreement makes plain, Abbott
and Costello furnished UPC with their routines for a limited purpose:
use in any movies in which the team appeared under the respective
agreements.[]{#co_fnRef_B00162039977848_ID0EHRCK_1
.anchor}[^16^](#co_footnote_B00162039977848_1) This is unmistakably the
language of an exclusive, limited-use license, not the assignment of
copyright. [See]{.underline} Compendium of Copyright Office Practices §
12.2.1 (1973) (stating that license is "exclusive or non-exclusive grant
of permission to use a copyrighted work for certain purposes").

 

A clause in the July Agreement granting UPC "all rights of every kind
and character whatsoever in and to the same \... perpetually" warrants
no different conclusion. J.A. 169. This language appears in the same
sentence as that quoted in the preceding paragraph and, thus, "all
rights \... in and to the same" can only be understood to reference
UPC\'s motion picture rights, not the team\'s common law copyright in
its routines.[]{#co_fnRef_B00172039977848_ID0EJUCK_1
.anchor}[^17^](#co_footnote_B00172039977848_1) Indeed, in the November
Agreement, wherein the team grants UPC the right to photograph and
reproduce their "acts," the "perpetual" right "to use the same" is
expressly granted "only in connection with the photoplays in which the
Artists appear hereunder and in connection with the advertising and
exploitation thereof." [Id.]{.underline} at 127. The November Agreement
states that "the Producer shall not have the right to use the Artists'
names or likenesses or reproductions of their voices in radio broadcasts
(except as hereinafter expressly permitted) independent of \... motion
picture productions or in commercial tie-ups." [Id.]{.underline} at 128.

 

Other language in the November Agreement further confirms that Abbott
and Costello granted UPC only a license to use their routines. The team
therein agreed "that they w\[ould\] not use or license, authorize or
permit the use of any of the material and/or routines" furnished to UPC
under the agreement "in connection with motion pictures for any person,
firm or corporation other than the Producer, at any time prior to the
termination of the employment of the Artists under this agreement or one
year after the general release of the photoplay in which used, whichever
is later." [Id.]{.underline} at 129. The fact that the Agreement limits
Abbott and Costello\'s ability to use or license specified material
([i.e.]{.underline}, material created before the agreements) only "in
connection with motion pictures," and only for a limited time, plainly
indicates the parties' understanding that the team retained ownership of
the copyright in their pre-agreement material and granted UPC only a
license. [See]{.underline} [[P.C. Films Corp. v. MGM/UA Home Video
Inc.]{.underline}, 138 F.3d 453, 456 (2d Cir. 1998)]() (explaining that
under 1909 Copyright Act, "transfer of anything less than the totality
of rights commanded by copyright was automatically a license rather than
an assignment \[of\] the copyright").

 

Thus, the language of the July and November Agreements, by itself,
clearly belies plaintiffs' claim that Abbott and Costello therein
conveyed their common law copyright in the Routine to UPC. That
conclusion is reinforced by the very Quitclaim on which plaintiffs'
claimed ownership of the [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} copyright
depends. To secure the Quitclaim of UPC\'s **\*190** interests in the
Routine (then held by its successor, Universal), plaintiffs'
predecessors-in-interest therein represented that they owned the
copyright in the Routine. In short, the parties to the Quitclaim
understood Abbott and Costello not to have transferred, but to have
retained, ownership of the Routine\'s copyright.

 

Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot state a plausible infringement claim
based on a 1940 transfer of copyright ownership from Abbott and Costello
to UPC in either the July or November Agreement. The record does not
support such assignment.[]{#co_fnRef_B00182039977848_ID0ET1CK_1
.anchor}[^18^](#co_footnote_B00182039977848_1)

 

> 2\. [Work Made for Hire]{.underline}

[**^\[24\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F242039977848_1)Plaintiffs maintain that,
even if the July and November Agreements cannot be construed to have
assigned copyrights, they are work-for-hire agreements. They argue that
UPC, "\[a\]s the author under a work-for-hire agreement of the films
\..., properly registered its copyright in these two films with the
Copyright Office, and thereafter timely renewed their copyright
registrations." Appellants' Br. 9; [see]{.underline} [[Estate of Burne
Hogarth v. Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]{.underline}, 342 F.3d 149,
156--57 (2d Cir. 2003)]() (explaining that, under 1909 Copyright Act,
employer was legal author and, therefore, had renewal rights).

 

The argument is defeated by plaintiffs' own allegation---which we must
accept as true---that the Routine was first performed in March 1938,
more than two years before Abbott and Costello entered into the July and
November Agreements with UPC. [See]{.underline} Am. Compl. ¶ 32. Insofar
as Abbott and Costello had already performed [Who\'s on
First?]{.underline} in 1938, they plainly did not [create]{.underline}
the Routine at UPC\'s "instance and expense" in 1940, as would be
required for it to be a work-for-hire. [[Playboy Enters., Inc. v.
Dumas]{.underline}, 53 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir. 1995)]() (stating that
work is considered "for hire" when made at hiring party\'s instance and
expense, [i.e.]{.underline}, "when the motivating factor in producing
the work was the employer who induced the creation" (internal quotation
marks omitted)); [see]{.underline} [also]{.underline} [[Urantia Found.
v. Maaherra]{.underline}, 114 F.3d 955, 961 (9th Cir. 1997)]() ("An
employment (or commissioning) relationship at the time the work is
created is a condition for claiming renewal as the proprietor of a work
made for hire." (internal quotation marks omitted)).

 

Plaintiffs seek to avoid this conclusion by noting defendants' (1)
concession---at least for purposes of their motion to dismiss---that new
material was added to the Routine for [Tropics]{.underline},
[see]{.underline} [[TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum]{.underline}, 151
F.Supp.3d at 431](); and (2) failure to establish "the contents,
language or scope of protectable expression of the 1938 radio
broadcast," Appellants' Reply Br. 22. We are not persuaded.

 

On review of a motion to dismiss, courts must draw all reasonable
inferences in plaintiffs' favor. Even applying that principle here, it
is not plausible to infer that the Routine, as performed in 1938, did
not already contain the initial series of exchanges about a person named
"Who" playing first base for the simple reason that there is no Routine
without at least that part. Further, because that is the part of the
Routine appropriated in [Hand to God]{.underline}, plaintiffs must
plausibly allege a valid copyright in that material, regardless of later
additions. Thus, to the extent plaintiffs' copyright claim rests on a
theory of work-for-hire, it was their burden to plead facts showing that
the appropriated parts **\*191** of the Routine had not existed in the
1938 iteration of [Who\'s on First?]{.underline}, but were first created
for [Tropics]{.underline} so as to be covered by the copyright and
copyright renewal of that movie. [See]{.underline} [[Feist Publ\'ns,
Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.]{.underline}, 499 U.S. at 361, 111 S.Ct.
1282]() (stating that to establish infringement claim,
[plaintiff]{.underline} must demonstrate, among other things, ownership
of valid copyright).

 

> 3\. [Merger of Routine in Motion Pictures]{.underline}

[**^\[25\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F252039977848_1)Finally, plaintiffs argue
that even if their copyright ownership claim cannot rest on either an
assignment or work-for-hire theory, it is plausible because "so much of
the Routine as was used in the Movies 'merged' with the Movies to become
a 'unitary whole.' " [See]{.underline} Appellants' Reply Br. 28. Thus,
the Routine was not separately registerable; rather it was protected by
UPC\'s statutory registration and its renewal of the copyrights for
movies using the Routine.

 

[**^\[26\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F262039977848_1)This argument also fails
because, as this court recently observed, "authors of
[freestanding]{.underline} works that are incorporated into a film \...
may copyright these 'separate and independent works.' " [[16 Casa Duse,
LLC v. Merkin]{.underline}, 791 F.3d 247, 259 (2d Cir. 2015)]()
(emphasis added) (quoting [17 U.S.C. § 101]()); [see]{.underline}
[[id.]{.underline} at 257]() (noting that separate copyrights may be
necessary where motion picture incorporates "separate, freestanding
pieces that independently constitute 'works of authorship' "). [Who\'s
on First?]{.underline} was such a freestanding work within
[Tropics]{.underline}. As already noted, plaintiffs acknowledged in the
amended complaint that the Routine (1) was prepared and existed on its
own for some years before it was performed in [Tropics]{.underline},
[see]{.underline} Am. Compl. ¶ 32; and (2) was performed independently
from the films "thousands of times" on the radio and elsewhere,
[see]{.underline} [id.]{.underline} at ¶¶ 34--35; [see also]{.underline}
J.A. 129 (stating in November Agreement that "Artists reserve the right
to use on the radio and in personal appearances" all preexisting
routines). The Quitclaim representation that plaintiffs'
predecessors-in-interest still owned the Routine\'s copyright in 1984 is
also at odds with the argument that the Routine had so merged with
[Tropics]{.underline} as to admit a single copyright owned by UPC.

 

Neither [[Garcia v. Google, Inc.]{.underline}, 786 F.3d 733 (9th Cir.
2015)]() ([en banc]{.underline}), nor [[Richlin v. Metro--Goldwyn--Mayer
Pictures, Inc.]{.underline}, 531 F.3d 962 (9th Cir. 2008)](), relied on
by plaintiffs, is to the contrary. In [[Garcia]{.underline}](), the
Ninth Circuit reversed a panel decision holding that an actor\'s
five-second contribution to a movie was sufficiently creative to entitle
her to register a copyright in her performance. The [en
banc]{.underline} court explained that "\[t\]reating every acting
performance as an independent work" would be a "logistical and financial
nightmare." [[Garcia v. Google, Inc.]{.underline}, 786 F.3d at 743]().
This case is not analogous. While the screen actor\'s performance there
was so "integrated into" the filmed work as to be "inseparable from" it,
[see]{.underline} [[16 Casa Duse, LLC v. Merkin]{.underline}, 791 F.3d
at 254](), [Who\'s on First?]{.underline} is a freestanding comedy
routine performed by Abbott and Costello not only years before the first
frame of [Tropics]{.underline} was ever filmed but also for many years
thereafter. Thus, the concerns at issue in [[Garcia]{.underline}]() are
not present here.

 

As for [[Richlin]{.underline}](), the Ninth Circuit did not there hold,
as plaintiffs contend, that an author is "[not]{.underline} entitled to
an independent copyright by reason of inclusion of his \[story\]
treatment\'s material in \[a\] motion picture." Appellants' Reply Br.
27--28 (emphasis in original). Rather, the court there assumed that
plaintiffs' story treatment was independently copyrightable when it held
that plaintiffs had "failed to secure a federal copyright for it."
**\*192** [[Richlin v. Metro--Goldwyn--Mayer Pictures,
Inc.]{.underline}, 531 F.3d at 976](). Thus, the court acknowledged that
"publication of a motion picture with notice secures federal statutory
copyright protection for all of its component parts," but observed "that
does not mean that the component parts necessarily each secure an
independent federal statutory copyright." [[Id.]{.underline} at
975--76](). The movie\'s publication protected so much of the treatment
as was disclosed therein, but it "did not constitute publication of the
Treatment 'as such'---i.e., as a work standing alone."
[[Id.]{.underline} at 973]().

 

This reasoning undermines rather than supports plaintiffs' merger
theory. The plaintiffs in [[Richlin]{.underline}]() "clearly intended"
that the treatment "be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts
of a unitary whole." [[Id.]{.underline} at 967](). That is not this
case. As already explained, the Routine was created and performed by
Abbott and Costello well before [Tropics]{.underline} was filmed, and
the team continued to perform it for years after. Indeed, the
Agreements' licensing of the Routine\'s performance in
[Tropics]{.underline} and [The Naughty Nineties]{.underline}
contemplated such independent performances. In these circumstances, we
conclude that the Routine did not merge into UPC\'s films so as to avoid
the need for its creators to renew the copyright. [See]{.underline} [[16
Casa Duse, LLC v. Merkin]{.underline}, 791 F.3d at 259]().

 

In sum, because plaintiffs fail plausibly to allege that (1) Abbott and
Costello assigned their common law copyright in [Who\'s on
First?]{.underline} to UPC; (2) the Routine, as appropriated by
defendants in [Hand to God]{.underline}, was first created for UPC as a
work-for-hire; or (3) the Routine so merged with the UPC movies in which
it was performed as to become a unitary whole, we conclude that
plaintiffs did not plead their possession of a valid copyright in the
Routine, as required to pursue their infringement claim.

 

Accordingly, even though the district court erred in dismissing
plaintiffs' amended complaint based on defendants' fair use of the
appropriated material, we affirm dismissal based on plaintiffs' failure
plausibly to allege a valid copyright.

 

**III. Conclusion**

To summarize, we conclude as follows:

 

1\. Dismissal was not supported by fair use because all four relevant
factors weigh in plaintiffs' favor:

> a\. Defendants' verbatim use of over a minute of [Who\'s on
> First?]{.underline} in their commercial production, [Hand to
> God]{.underline}, was not transformative because defendants neither
> used so much of the Routine for a different purpose nor imbued the
> original with a different message, meaning, or expression;
>
> b\. Defendants failed persuasively to justify their use of the
> Routine, as a secondary user who appropriates a creative work without
> alteration must do;
>
> c\. Defendants' use of some dozen of the Routine\'s variations of
> "who\'s on first" was excessive in relation to any dramatic purpose;
> and
>
> d\. Plaintiffs allege an active secondary market for the work, which
> was not considered by the district court.

 

2\. Dismissal is warranted by plaintiffs' failure plausibly to plead
ownership of a valid copyright. Their efforts to do so on theories of
assignment, work-for-hire, and merger all fail as a matter of law.

 

Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED.
