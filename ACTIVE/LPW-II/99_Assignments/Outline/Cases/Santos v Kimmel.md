**Synopsis**

**Background:** Former congressman brought action against late-night
show host and the companies that owned and broadcasted his show for
copyright infringement and state law claims of breach of contract,
breach of implied contract, and fraudulent inducement, with all claims
based on host airing personalized videos that congressman made in
response to requests that host had submitted using various fictitious
names. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, [Denise Cote](), J., granted defendants\' motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim, concluding that copyright claims were barred
by fair use doctrine and that state law claims were either preempted by
the Copyright Act or failed to state a claim. Former congressman
appealed.

 

**Holdings:** The Court of Appeals, [Lohier](), Circuit Judge, held
that:

 

[^\[1\]^](#co_anchor_F72057972365_1) purpose and character of use
strongly supported a finding of fair use;

 

[^\[2\]^](#co_anchor_F92057972365_1) fair use factors in total supported
finding that fair use barred former congressman\'s copyright
infringement claims;

 

[^\[3\]^](#co_anchor_F122057972365_1) under Illinois law, former
congressman failed to state a direct breach of contract claim;

 

[^\[4\]^](#co_anchor_F142057972365_1) under New York law, former
congressman failed to state a breach of implied contract claim; and

 

[^\[5\]^](#co_anchor_F162057972365_1) under New York law, former
congressman failed to state a fraudulent inducement claim.

 

Affirmed.

 

**Procedural Posture(s):** On Appeal; Motion to Dismiss for Failure to
State a Claim.

**Opinion**

[LOHIER](), Circuit Judge:

**\*33** Former Congressman George Santos appeals from a final judgment
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (Cote, *J.*) dismissing his copyright infringement and state law
claims against Jimmy Kimmel, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.
("ABC"), which airs Kimmel\'s late-night show Jimmy Kimmel Live!
("JKL"), and ABC\'s parent company, The Walt Disney Company. Santos\'s
suit arose after Kimmel, using various fictitious names, submitted
requests to Santos for personalized videos through the Cameo platform.
Santos fulfilled each request, and Kimmel then aired the videos on JKL
as part of a mocking series of segments titled "Will Santos Say It?" The
District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim
under [Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure](),
concluding that the copyright claims were barred by the fair use
doctrine and that Santos\'s state law claims either were preempted by
the Copyright Act or failed to state a claim. Because we agree that
Santos\'s copyright claims were barred by the fair use doctrine and
further conclude that each of Santos\'s state law claims failed to state
a claim, we affirm.

> **I. Copyright Infringement and Fair Use**

[**^\[3\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F32057972365_1)In a copyright action, the
affirmative defense of fair use "excuses what might otherwise be
considered infringing behavior, allowing courts to avoid rigid
application of the Copyright Act when it would stifle the very
creativity the Act is meant to promote." **\*34** [*Hachette Book Grp.,
Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 179 (2d Cir. 2024)]()
(quotation marks omitted). Under the Copyright Act, we consider the
following non-exclusive factors in determining whether fair use has been
established: "(1) the purpose and character of the use \... ; (2) the
nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the
portion used \... ; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential
market for or value of the copyrighted work." [17 U.S.C. § 107]().

[**^\[5\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F52057972365_1)
[**^\[6\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F62057972365_1)In assessing the "purpose and
character of the use" factor, we "focus\[ \] chiefly on the degree to
which the use is transformative, *i.e.*, whether the new work merely
supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds
something new, with a further purpose or different character." [*Andy
Warhol Found. for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, 11 F.4th 26, 37 (2d
Cir. 2021)]() (quotation marks omitted). Our focus reflects an
understanding that "fair use is a flexible concept, whose application
varies depending on the context." [*Hachette Book Grp.*, 115 F.4th at
179]() (quotation marks omitted). It may be "so clearly established by a
complaint as to support dismissal of a copyright infringement claim

> Moshe Klein
>
> LPW2 \| 2/3/2026 21:40:47

" at the pleading stage. [*TCA Television Corp.*, 839 F.3d at 178]().

 

[**^\[7\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F72057972365_1)
[**^\[8\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F82057972365_1)Addressing the "purpose and
character of the use" factor, Santos maintains that the use was not
transformative because Kimmel "instigated the creation of the original
Works" and accordingly is the "designer\[ \]" of their original purpose.
Appellant\'s Br. 11. Santos does not dispute the District Court\'s
finding that the purpose of the allegedly infringing use was "to comment
on the willingness of Santos \... to say absurd things for money."
App\'x 235. He argues instead that this was also *his* original purpose
in making the videos. But whether a secondary use is transformative
turns on what a reasonable observer thinks, not the subjective intent of
the copyright holder or that of the secondary user. *See* [*Andy Warhol
Found. for Visual Arts, Inc. v*. *Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508, 544, 143
S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d 473 (2023)]() ("\[T\]he subjective intent of the
user (or the subjective interpretation of a court) \[does not\]
determine the purpose of the use.")

> Moshe Klein
>
> LPW2 \| 2/3/2026 21:41:43
>
> subjective doesn\'t matter

. As Santos\'s original allegation acknowledges, a reasonable observer
here would think the videos conveyed "feelings of hope, strength,
perseverance, encouragement, and positivity," not a willingness to say
absurd things for money. App\'x 15.

 

Santos also contends that Kimmel\'s false representations demonstrate
bad faith and thus nullify the fair use defense. *See* [*Harper & Row
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.*, 471 U.S. 539, 562--63, 105 S.Ct.
2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985)](). We disagree. It is true that the Supreme
Court stated in [*Harper & Row*]() that "\[f\]air use presupposes good
faith and fair dealing." [*Id.* at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218]() (quotation
marks omitted). But the Court has since distanced itself from this
statement.[]{#co_fnRef_B00012057972365_ID0EDRBG_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00012057972365_1) In any event, Santos\'s
complaint contradicts any claim of a purpose on the Defendants' part to
"supplant" Santos\'s "commercially valuable right" in the videos.
[*Swatch Grp. Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. v. Bloomberg L.P.*, 756 F.3d 73, 83 (2d
Cir. 2014)]() (quotation marks omitted). To the contrary, the complaint
paints a portrait of defendants motivated by (sarcastic) **\*35**
criticism and commentary. *See* [*Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804
F.3d 202, 215--16 (2d Cir. 2015)](). We thus agree with the District
Court that the first factor strongly supports a finding of fair use.

 

[**^\[9\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F92057972365_1)
[**^\[10\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F102057972365_1)We are equally unpersuaded
by Santos\'s challenges to the District Court\'s analysis of the
remaining factors. Among other things, the relevant copyright
registrations establish that the videos were published on the same day
they were created. *See* App\'x 160--69; [17 U.S.C. § 101](). And it is
clear on the face of Santos\'s complaint that Santos has not suffered
market harm within the meaning of the fourth fair use factor because
"\[w\]e ask not whether the second work would *damage* the market for
the first (by, for example, devaluing it through parody or criticism),
but whether it *usurps* the market for the first by offering a competing
substitute." [*Hachette Book Grp.*, 115 F.4th at 189]() (quotation marks
omitted); *see* [*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569,
592, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)]() ("\[T\]he unlikelihood
that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or
lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion
of a potential licensing market.").

 

[**^\[11\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F112057972365_1)Because we need only
consider "the original version of \[the videos\] and the \[JKL
segments\] at issue" to decide "the question of fair use," [*Cariou v.
Prince*, 714 F.3d 694, 707 (2d Cir. 2013)]() (quotation marks omitted),
we affirm the District Court\'s conclusion that fair use bars Santos\'s
copyright claims even at the pleading stage.

 

> **II. State Law Claims**

Santos also appeals the District Court\'s dismissal of his state law
claims for breach of contract, breach of implied contract, and
fraudulent inducement. The District Court dismissed the first two state
law claims on the ground that they were preempted by the Copyright Act.
Santos responds that those claims are "*qualitatively* different from a
copyright infringement claim" and thus not preempted. [*Melendez v.
Sirius XM Radio, Inc.*, 50 F.4th 294, 302 (2d Cir. 2022)]() (quotation
marks omitted). We need not resolve this issue, however, because
Santos\'s state law contract claims fail to state a claim for relief
under state law.

 

[**^\[12\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F122057972365_1)
[**^\[13\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F132057972365_1)We first address Santos\'s
direct breach of contract claim under the Cameo Terms of Service. Santos
is not party to the Terms of Service to which users (like Kimmel) must
agree and that Santos alleges were breached. Under Illinois law, which
governs the Terms of Service, there is a "strong presumption against
conferring benefits to noncontracting third parties." [*Barry v. St.
Mary\'s Hosp. Decatur*, 409 Ill.Dec. 856, 68 N.E.3d 964, 976 (Ill. App.
Ct. 2016)](). Indeed, "the implication that the contract applies to
third parties must be so strong as to be practically an express
declaration." [*Id.*]() (quotation marks omitted). Here, Santos
identifies nothing close to an "express declaration" that the relevant
provisions of the Terms of Service apply to him or other noncontracting
parties. Indeed, other provisions of the Terms of Service *do* contain
third-party beneficiary language, indicating that when the parties to
that agreement intended to allow provisions of the contract to be
enforced by third parties, they said so expressly.

 

[**^\[14\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F142057972365_1)
[**^\[15\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F152057972365_1)We next address Santos\'s
breach of implied contract claim. Under New York law, which governs this
claim, we consider "the intent of the parties and the surrounding
circumstances" to determine "\[w\]hether an implied-in-fact contract was
formed and, if so, the extent of its terms." **\*36** [*Rocky Point
Props., Inc. v. Sear-Brown Grp., Inc.*, 295 A.D.2d 911, 744 N.Y.S.2d
269, 271 (4th Dep\'t 2002)]() (quotation marks omitted). In this case,
however, Santos\'s complaint does not "allege, in nonconclusory
language, \... the essential terms of the parties' \... contract,
including those specific provisions of the contract upon which liability
is predicated." [*Caniglia v. Chi. Trib.-N.Y. News Syndicate, Inc.*, 204
A.D.2d 233, 612 N.Y.S.2d 146, 147 (1st Dep\'t 1994)](); *see* App\'x 22
¶¶ 78-79 (failing to plead the essential terms of the putative implied
contract that the Defendants allegedly breached). Nor does Santos
plausibly allege that there was "an indication of a meeting of minds of
the parties constituting an agreement" that Kimmel would adhere to the
Terms of Service. [*DG & A Mgmt. Servs., LLC v. Secs. Indus. Ass\'n
Compliance & Legal Div.*, 52 A.D.3d 922, 859 N.Y.S.2d 305, 306 (3d
Dep\'t 2008)]() (quotation marks omitted); *see also* [*Tjoa v. Julia
Butterfield Mem\'l Hosp.*, 205 A.D.2d 526, 612 N.Y.S.2d 676, 677 (2d
Dep\'t 1994)]().

 

[**^\[16\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F162057972365_1)Finally, Santos challenges
the District Court\'s dismissal of his fraudulent inducement claim for
failure to allege any out-of-pocket loss as required under New York law.
*See* [*Lama Holding Co. v. Smith Barney Inc.*, 88 N.Y.2d 413, 421, 646
N.Y.S.2d 76, 668 N.E.2d 1370 (1996)](). We agree with the District
Court\'s conclusion that Santos failed to allege that he suffered any
actual out-of-pocket loss as the victim of the alleged fraud. *See*
[*Connaughton v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.*, 29 N.Y.3d 137, 142--43,
53 N.Y.S.3d 598, 75 N.E.3d 1159 (2017)](). We therefore affirm the
District Court\'s dismissal of that claim.

 

**CONCLUSION**

We have considered Santos\'s remaining arguments and conclude that they
are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we **AFFIRM** the judgment
of the District Court.
