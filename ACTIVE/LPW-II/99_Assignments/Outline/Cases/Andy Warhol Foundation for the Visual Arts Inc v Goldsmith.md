**Synopsis**

**Background:** Artistic foundation brought action against professional
photographer, seeking judgment declaring that screenprint illustrations
created by artist using photographer\'s picture of a famous musician did
not constitute violations of the Copyright Act. Photographer
counterclaimed, asserting copyright infringement. The United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, [John G.
Koeltl](), J., [382 F.Supp.3d 312](), granted foundation summary
judgment and dismissed photographer\'s counterclaim. Photographer
appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
[Lynch](), Senior Circuit Judge, [11 F.4th 26](), reversed in part,
vacated in part, and remanded. Foundation filed petition for writ of
certiorari, which was granted.

 

[**\[Holding:\]**](#co_anchor_F162074754246_1) The Supreme Court,
Justice [Sotomayor](), held that purpose and character of foundation\'s
use of photograph in commercially licensing screenprint illustrations to
magazine publisher did not favor foundation\'s fair use defense to
copyright infringement.

 

Affirmed.

 

Justices [Thomas](), [Alito](), [Gorsuch](), [Kavanaugh](), [Barrett](),
and [Jackson]() joined.

 

Justice [Gorsuch]() filed concurring opinion, in which Justice
[Jackson]() joined.

 

Justice [Kagan]() filed dissenting opinion, in which Chief Justice
[Roberts]() joined.

 

**Procedural Posture(s):** Petition for Writ of Certiorari; On Appeal;
Motion for Summary Judgment; Motion for Declaratory Judgment.

**\*508** In 2016, petitioner Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual
Arts, Inc. (AWF) licensed to Condé Nast for \$10,000 an image of "Orange
Prince"---an orange silkscreen portrait of the musician Prince created
by pop artist Andy Warhol---to appear on the cover of a magazine
commemorating Prince. Orange Prince is one of 16 works now known as the
Prince Series that Warhol derived from a copyrighted photograph taken in
1981 by respondent Lynn Goldsmith, a professional photographer.
Goldsmith had been commissioned by Newsweek in 1981 to photograph a then
"up and coming" musician named Prince Rogers Nelson, after which
Newsweek published one of Goldsmith\'s photos along with an article
about Prince. Years later, Goldsmith granted a limited license to Vanity
Fair for use of one of her Prince photos as an "artist reference for an
illustration." The terms of the license included that the use would be
for "one time" only. Vanity Fair hired Warhol to create the
illustration, and Warhol used Goldsmith\'s photo to create a purple
silkscreen portrait of Prince, which appeared with an article about
Prince in Vanity Fair\'s November 1984 issue. The magazine credited
Goldsmith for the "source photograph" and paid her \$400. After Prince
died in 2016, Vanity Fair\'s parent company (Condé Nast) asked AWF about
reusing the 1984 Vanity Fair image for a special edition magazine that
would commemorate Prince. When Condé Nast learned about the other Prince
Series images, it opted instead to purchase a license from AWF to
publish Orange Prince. Goldsmith did not know about the Prince Series
until 2016, when she saw Orange Prince on the cover of Condé Nast\'s
magazine. Goldsmith notified AWF of her belief that it had infringed her
copyright. AWF then sued Goldsmith for a declaratory judgment of
noninfringement or, in the alternative, fair use. Goldsmith
counterclaimed for infringement. The District Court considered the four
fair use factors in [17 U.S.C. § 107]() and granted AWF summary judgment
on its defense of fair use. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that
all four fair use factors favored Goldsmith. In this Court, the sole
question presented is whether the first fair use factor, "the purpose
and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes," **\*509** [§
107(1)](), weighs in favor of AWF\'s recent commercial licensing to
Condé Nast.

 

*Held*: The "purpose and character" of AWF\'s use of Goldsmith\'s
photograph in commercially licensing Orange Prince to Condé Nast does
not favor AWF\'s fair use defense to copyright infringement. Pp. 1272 --
1287.

 

\(a\) AWF contends that the Prince Series works are "transformative,"
and that the first fair use factor thus weighs in AWF\'s favor, because
the works convey a different meaning or message than the photograph. But
the first fair use factor instead focuses on whether an allegedly
infringing use has a further purpose or different character, which is a
matter of degree, and the degree of difference must be weighed against
other considerations, like commercialism. Although new expression,
meaning, or message may be relevant to whether a copying use has a
sufficiently distinct purpose or character, it is not, without more,
dispositive of the first factor. Here, the specific use of Goldsmith\'s
photograph alleged to infringe her copyright is AWF\'s licensing of
Orange Prince to Condé Nast. As portraits of Prince used to depict
Prince in magazine stories about Prince, the original photograph and
AWF\'s copying use of it share substantially the same purpose. Moreover,
AWF\'s use is of a commercial nature. Even though Orange Prince adds new
expression to Goldsmith\'s photograph, in the context of the challenged
use, the first fair use factor still favors Goldsmith. Pp. 1272 -- 1281.

 

\(1\) The Copyright Act encourages creativity by granting to the creator
of an original work a bundle of rights that includes the rights to
reproduce the copyrighted work and to prepare derivative works. [17
U.S.C. § 106](). Copyright, however, balances the benefits of incentives
to create against the costs of restrictions on copying. This balancing
act is reflected in the common-law doctrine of fair use, codified in [§
107](), which provides: "\[T\]he fair use of a copyrighted work, \...
for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching \... ,
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright." To
determine whether a particular use is "fair," the statute enumerates
four factors to be considered. The factors "set forth general
principles, the application of which requires judicial balancing,
depending upon relevant circumstances." [*Google LLC* *v. Oracle
America, Inc.*, 593 U. S. --------, --------, 141 S.Ct. 1183, 209
L.Ed.2d 311]().

 

The first fair use factor, "the purpose and character of the use,
including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes," [§ 107(1)](), considers the reasons for, and
nature of, the copier\'s use of an original work. The central question
it asks is whether the use "merely supersedes the objects of the
original creation \... (supplanting the original), or instead adds
something new, with a further purpose or different character." **\*510**
[*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500]() (internal quotation marks omitted). As most
copying has some further purpose and many secondary works add something
new, the first factor asks "whether *and to what extent*" the use at
issue has a purpose or character different from the original.
[*Ibid.*]() (emphasis added). The larger the difference, the more likely
the first factor weighs in favor of fair use. A use that has a further
purpose or different character is said to be "transformative," but that
too is a matter of degree. [*Ibid.*]() To preserve the copyright
owner\'s right to prepare derivative works, defined in § 101 of the
Copyright Act to include "any other form in which a work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted," the degree of transformation required to make
"transformative" use of an original work must go beyond that required to
qualify as a derivative.

 

The Court\'s decision in [*Campbell*]() is instructive. In holding that
parody may be fair use, the Court explained that "parody has an obvious
claim to transformative value" because "it can provide social benefit,
by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a
new one." [510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). The use at issue was 2
Live Crew\'s copying of Roy Orbison\'s song, "Oh, Pretty Woman," to
create a rap derivative, "Pretty Woman." 2 Live Crew transformed
Orbison\'s song by adding new lyrics and musical elements, such that
"Pretty Woman" had a different message and aesthetic than "Oh, Pretty
Woman." But that did not end the Court\'s analysis of the first fair use
factor. The Court found it necessary to determine whether 2 Live Crew\'s
transformation rose to the level of parody, a distinct purpose of
commenting on the original or criticizing it. Further distinguishing
between parody and satire, the Court explained that "\[p\]arody needs to
mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the
creation of its victim\'s (or collective victims') imagination, whereas
satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for
the very act of borrowing." [*Id.*, at 580--581, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). More
generally, when "commentary has no critical bearing on the substance or
style of the original composition, \... the claim to fairness in
borrowing from another\'s work diminishes accordingly (if it does not
vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its commerciality, loom
larger." [*Id.*, at 580, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

[*Campbell*]() illustrates two important points. First, the fact that a
use is commercial as opposed to nonprofit is an additional element of
the first fair use factor. The commercial nature of a use is relevant,
but not dispositive. It is to be weighed against the degree to which the
use has a further purpose or different character. Second, the first
factor relates to the justification for the use. In a broad sense, a use
that has a distinct purpose is justified because it furthers the goal of
copyright, namely, to promote the progress of science and the arts,
without diminishing **\*511** the incentive to create. In a narrower
sense, a use may be justified because copying is reasonably necessary to
achieve the user\'s new purpose. Parody, for example, "needs to mimic an
original to make its point." [*Id.*, at 580--581, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().
Similarly, other commentary or criticism that targets an original work
may have compelling reason to "conjure up" the original by borrowing
from it. [*Id.,* at 588, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). An independent justification
like this is particularly relevant to assessing fair use where an
original work and copying use share the same or highly similar purposes,
or where wide dissemination of a secondary work would otherwise run the
risk of substitution for the original or licensed derivatives of it.
See, [*id.*, at 580 n. 14, 141 S.Ct. at 1203-1204]().

 

In sum, if an original work and secondary use share the same or highly
similar purposes, and the secondary use is commercial, the first fair
use factor is likely to weigh against fair use, absent some other
justification for copying. Pp. 1273 -- 1277.

 

\(2\) The fair use provision, and the first factor in particular,
requires an analysis of the specific "use" of a copyrighted work that is
alleged to be "an infringement." [§ 107](). The same copying may be fair
when used for one purpose but not another. See [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at
585, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Here, Goldsmith\'s copyrighted photograph has
been used in multiple ways. The Court limits its analysis to the
specific use alleged to be infringing in this case---AWF\'s commercial
licensing of Orange Prince to Condé Nast---and expresses no opinion as
to the creation, display, or sale of the original Prince Series works.
In the context of Condé Nast\'s special edition magazine commemorating
Prince, the purpose of the Orange Prince image is substantially the same
as that of Goldsmith\'s original photograph. Both are portraits of
Prince used in magazines to illustrate stories about Prince. The use
also is of a commercial nature. Taken together, these two elements
counsel against fair use here. Although a use\'s transformativeness may
outweigh its commercial character, in this case both point in the same
direction. That does not mean that all of Warhol\'s derivative works,
nor all uses of them, give rise to the same fair use analysis. Pp. 1277
-- 1281.

 

\(b\) AWF contends that the purpose and character of its use of
Goldsmith\'s photograph weighs in favor of fair use because Warhol\'s
silkscreen image of the photograph has a different meaning or message.
By adding new expression to the photograph, AWF says, Warhol made
transformative use of it. [*Campbell*]() did describe a transformative
use as one that "alter\[s\] the first \[work\] with new expression,
meaning, or message." [510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). But
[*Campbell*]() cannot be read to mean that [§ 107(1)]() weighs in favor
of any use that adds new expression, meaning, or message. Otherwise,
"transformative use" would swallow the copyright owner\'s exclusive
right to prepare derivative works, as many **\*512** derivative works
that "recast, transfor\[m\] or adap\[t\]" the original, § 101, add new
expression of some kind. The meaning of a secondary work, as reasonably
can be perceived, should be considered to the extent necessary to
determine whether the purpose of the use is distinct from the original.
For example, the Court in [*Campbell*]() considered the messages of 2
Live Crew\'s song to determine whether the song had a parodic purpose.
But fair use is an objective inquiry into what a user does with an
original work, not an inquiry into the subjective intent of the user, or
into the meaning or impression that an art critic or judge draws from a
work.

 

Even granting the District Court\'s conclusion that Orange Prince
reasonably can be perceived to portray Prince as iconic, whereas
Goldsmith\'s portrayal is photorealistic, that difference must be
evaluated in the context of the specific use at issue. The purpose of
AWF\'s recent commercial licensing of Orange Prince was to illustrate a
magazine about Prince with a portrait of Prince. Although the purpose
could be more specifically described as illustrating a magazine about
Prince with a portrait of Prince, one that portrays Prince somewhat
differently from Goldsmith\'s photograph (yet has no critical bearing on
her photograph), that degree of difference is not enough for the first
factor to favor AWF, given the specific context and commercial nature of
the use. To hold otherwise might authorize a range of commercial copying
of photographs to be used for purposes that are substantially the same
as those of the originals.

 

AWF asserts another related purpose of Orange Prince, which is to
comment on the "dehumanizing nature" and "effects" of celebrity. No
doubt, many of Warhol\'s works, and particularly his uses of repeated
images, can be perceived as depicting celebrities as commodities. But
even if such commentary is perceptible on the cover of Condé Nast\'s
tribute to "Prince Rogers Nelson, 1958--2016," on the occasion of the
man\'s death, the asserted commentary is at [*Campbell*]()'s lowest ebb:
It "has no critical bearing on" Goldsmith\'s photograph, thus the
commentary\'s "claim to fairness in borrowing from" her work "diminishes
accordingly (if it does not vanish)." [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580, 114
S.Ct. 1164](). The commercial nature of the use, on the other hand,
"loom\[s\] larger." [*Ibid*.]() Like satire that does not target an
original work, AWF\'s asserted commentary "can stand on its own two feet
and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing." [*Id*., at
581, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Moreover, because AWF\'s copying of Goldsmith\'s
photograph was for a commercial use so similar to the photograph\'s
typical use, a particularly compelling justification is needed. Copying
the photograph because doing so was merely helpful to convey a new
meaning or message is not justification enough. Pp. 1281 -- 1287.

 

**\*513** (c) Goldsmith\'s original works, like those of other
photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous
artists. Such protection includes the right to prepare derivative works
that transform the original. The use of a copyrighted work may
nevertheless be fair if, among other things, the use has a purpose and
character that is sufficiently distinct from the original. In this case,
however, Goldsmith\'s photograph of Prince, and AWF\'s copying use of
the photograph in an image licensed to a special edition magazine
devoted to Prince, share substantially the same commercial purpose. AWF
has offered no other persuasive justification for its unauthorized use
of the photograph. While the Court has cautioned that the four statutory
fair use factors may not "be treated in isolation, one from another,"
but instead all must be "weighed together, in light of the purposes of
copyright," [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164](), here AWF
challenges only the Court of Appeals' determinations on the first fair
use factor, and the Court agrees the first factor favors Goldsmith. P.
1287.

**Opinion**

Justice [SOTOMAYOR]() delivered the opinion of the Court.

**\*514** **\*\*1266** This copyright case involves not one, but two
artists. The first, Andy Warhol, is well known. His images of products
**\*515** like Campbell\'s soup cans and of celebrities like Marilyn
Monroe appear in museums around the world. Warhol\'s contribution to
contemporary art is undeniable.

 

The second, Lynn Goldsmith, is less well known. But she too was a
trailblazer. Goldsmith began a career in rock-and-roll photography when
there were few women in the genre. Her award-winning concert and
portrait images, however, shot to the top. Goldsmith\'s work appeared in
Life, Time, Rolling Stone, and People magazines, not to mention the
National Portrait Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art. She captured
some of the 20th century\'s greatest rock stars: Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger,
Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen, and, as relevant here, Prince.

 

In 1984, Vanity Fair sought to license one of Goldsmith\'s Prince
photographs for use as an "artist reference." The magazine wanted the
photograph to help illustrate a story about the musician. Goldsmith
agreed, on the condition that the use of her photo be for "one time"
only. 1 App. 85. The artist Vanity Fair hired was Andy Warhol. Warhol
made a silkscreen using Goldsmith\'s photo, and Vanity Fair published
the resulting image alongside an article about Prince. The magazine
credited Goldsmith for the "source photograph," and it paid her \$400. 2
*id.*, at 323, 325--326.

 

Warhol, however, did not stop there. From Goldsmith\'s photograph, he
derived 15 additional works. Later, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the
Visual Arts, Inc. (AWF) licensed one of those works to Condé Nast, again
for the purpose of illustrating a magazine story about Prince. AWF came
away with \$10,000. Goldsmith received nothing.

 

When Goldsmith informed AWF that she believed its use of her photograph
infringed her copyright, AWF sued her. The District Court granted
summary judgment for AWF on its assertion of "fair use," [17 U.S.C. §
107](), but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. In
this Court, the **\*516** sole question presented is whether the first
fair use factor, "the purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes," [§ 107(1)](), weighs in favor of AWF\'s recent
commercial licensing to Condé Nast. On that narrow issue, and limited to
the challenged use, the Court agrees with the Second Circuit: The first
factor favors Goldsmith, not AWF.

 

I

Lynn Goldsmith is a professional photographer. Her specialty is concert
and portrait photography of musicians. At age 16, Goldsmith got one of
her first shots: an image of the Beatles' "trendy boots" before the band
performed live on The Ed Sullivan Show. S. Michel, Rock Portraits, N. Y.
Times, Dec. 2, 2007, p. G64. Within 10 years, Goldsmith had photographed
everyone from Led Zeppelin to James Brown (the latter in concert in
Kinshasa, no less). At that time, Goldsmith "had few female peers."
*Ibid.* But she was a self-starter. She quickly became "a leading rock
photographer" in an era "when women on the scene were largely dismissed
as groupies." *Ibid.*

 

In 1981, Goldsmith convinced Newsweek magazine to hire her to photograph
Prince Rogers Nelson, then an "up and coming" and "hot young musician."
2 App. 315. Newsweek agreed, and Goldsmith took photos of Prince in
concert at the Palladium in New York City and in her studio on West 36th
Street. Newsweek ran one of **\*\*1267** the concert photos, together
with an article titled " 'The Naughty Prince of Rock.' " *Id.*, at 320.
Goldsmith retained the other photos. She holds copyright in all of them.

 

One of Goldsmith\'s studio photographs, a black and white portrait of
Prince, is the original copyrighted work at issue in this case. See fig.
1, *infra*.

 

**\*517**

> 1981 by Lynn Goldsmith.

In 1984, Goldsmith, through her agency, licensed that photograph to
Vanity Fair to serve as an "artist reference for an illustration" in the
magazine. 1 App. 85. The terms of the license were that the illustration
was "to be published in Vanity Fair November 1984 issue. It can appear
one time full page and one time under one quarter page. No other usage
right granted." *Ibid*. Goldsmith was to receive \$400 and a source
credit.

 

To make the illustration, Vanity Fair hired pop artist Andy Warhol.
Warhol was already a major figure in American art, known among other
things for his silkscreen portraits of
celebrities.[]{#co_fnRef_B00022074754246_ID0EESBI_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00022074754246_1) From Goldsmith\'s
photograph, Warhol created **\*518** a silkscreen portrait of Prince,
which appeared alongside an article about Prince in the November 1984
issue of Vanity Fair. See fig. 2, *infra*. The article, titled "Purple
Fame," is primarily about the "sexual style" of the new celebrity and
his music. Vanity Fair, Nov. 1984, p. 66. Goldsmith received her \$400
fee, and Vanity Fair credited her for the "source photograph." 2 App.
323, 325--326. Warhol received an unspecified amount.

 

**\*\*1268**

[​]()

> Figure 2. A purple silkscreen portrait of Prince created in 1984 by
> Andy Warhol to illustrate an article in Vanity Fair

In addition to the single illustration authorized by the Vanity Fair
license, Warhol created 15 other works based on Goldsmith\'s photograph:
13 silkscreen prints and two pencil drawings. The works are collectively
referred to as the "Prince Series." See Appendix, *infra*. Goldsmith did
not know about the Prince Series until 2016, when she saw the image of
an orange silkscreen portrait of Prince ("Orange **\*519** Prince") on
the cover of a magazine published by Vanity Fair\'s parent company,
Condé Nast. See fig. 3, *infra*.

 

[​]()

By that time, Warhol had died, and the Prince Series had passed to the
Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. AWF no longer possesses
the works,[]{#co_fnRef_B00032074754246_ID0EI1BI_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00032074754246_1) but it asserts copyright
in them. It has licensed images of the works for commercial **\*\*1269**
and editorial uses. In particular, after Prince died in 2016, Condé Nast
contacted AWF about the possibility of reusing the 1984 Vanity Fair
image for a special edition magazine that would commemorate Prince. Once
AWF informed Condé Nast about the other Prince Series images, however,
Condé Nast obtained a license to publish Orange Prince instead. The
magazine, titled "The Genius of **\*520** Prince," is a tribute to
"Prince Rogers Nelson, 1958--2016." It is "devoted to Prince." 2 App.
352. Condé Nast paid AWF \$10,000 for the license. Goldsmith received
neither a fee nor a source credit.

 

Remember that Goldsmith, too, had licensed her Prince images to
magazines such as Newsweek, to accompany a story about the musician, and
Vanity Fair, to serve as an artist reference. But that was not all.
Between 1981 and 2016, Goldsmith\'s photos of Prince appeared on or
between the covers of People, Readers Digest, Guitar World, and Musician
magazines. See, *e.g.*, fig. 4, *infra*.

 

[​]()

> Figure 4. One of Lynn Goldsmith\'s photographs of Prince on the cover
> of Musician magazine.

People magazine, in fact, paid Goldsmith \$1,000 to use one of her
copyrighted photographs in a special collector\'s edition, "Celebrating
Prince: 1958--2016," just after Prince died. People\'s tribute, like
Condé Nast\'s, honors the life and music of Prince. Other magazines,
including Rolling **\*521** Stone and Time, also released special
editions. See fig. 5, *infra*. All of them depicted Prince on the cover.
All of them used a copyrighted photograph in service of that object. And
all of them (except Condé Nast) credited the photographer.

**\*522** When Goldsmith saw Orange Prince on the cover of Condé Nast\'s

flattens, traces, and colors the photo but otherwise does not alter it.

Goldsmith notified AWF of her belief that it had infringed her
copyright. AWF then sued Goldsmith and her agency for a declaratory
judgment of noninfringement or, in the alternative, fair use. Goldsmith
counterclaimed for infringement.

 

The District Court granted summary judgment for [AWF. 382 F.Supp.3d 312,
316 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)](). The court considered the four fair use factors
enumerated in [17 U.S.C. § 107]() and held that the Prince Series works
made fair use of Goldsmith\'s photograph. As to the first factor, the
works were "transformative" because, looking at them and the photograph
"side-by-side," they "have a different character, give Goldsmith\'s
photograph a new expression, and employ new aesthetics with creative and
communicative results distinct from Goldsmith\'s." [382 F.Supp.3d at
325--326]() (internal **\*523** quotation marks and alterations
omitted). In particular, the works "can reasonably be perceived to have
transformed Prince from a vulnerable, uncomfortable person to an iconic,
larger-than-life figure," such that "each Prince Series work is
immediately recognizable as a 'Warhol' rather than as a photograph of
Prince." [*Id.*, at 326](). Although the second factor, the nature of
Goldsmith\'s copyrighted work (creative and unpublished), "would
ordinarily weigh in \[her\] favor \... , this factor \[was\] of limited
importance because the Prince Series works are transformative." [*Id.*,
at 327](). The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the
portion used in relation to the copyrighted work, favored AWF because,
according to the District Court, "Warhol removed nearly all the
photograph\'s protectible elements in creating the Prince Series."
[*Id.*, at 330](). Finally, the fourth factor likewise favored AWF
because "the Prince Series works are not market substitutes that have
harmed---or have the potential to harm---Goldsmith." [*Id.*, at 331]().

 

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. [11
F.4th 26, 54 (2021)](). It held that all four fair use factors favored
Goldsmith. On the first factor, "the purpose and character of the use,"
[§ 107(1)](), the Court of Appeals rejected the notion that "any
secondary work that adds a new aesthetic or new expression to its source
material is necessarily transformative." [*Id.*, at 38--39](). The
question was, instead, "whether the secondary work\'s use of its source
material is in service of a fundamentally different and **\*\*1272** new
artistic purpose and character." [*Id.*, at 42]() (internal quotation
marks omitted). Such "transformative purpose and character must, at bare
minimum, comprise something more than the imposition of another
artist\'s style on the primary work." [*Ibid.*]() Here, however, "the
overarching purpose and function of the two works at issue \... is
identical, not merely in the broad sense that they are created as works
of visual art, but also in the narrow but essential sense that they are
portraits of the same person." [*Ibid.*]() (footnote **\*524** omitted).
The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court\'s logic that "
'each Prince Series work' " is transformative because it " 'is
immediately recognizable as a "Warhol," ' " which the Court of Appeals
believed would "create a celebrity-plagiarist privilege." [*Id.*, at
43](); see also [*ibid.*]() ("\[T\]he fact that Martin Scorsese\'s
recent film *The Irishman* is recognizably 'a Scorsese' does not absolve
him of the obligation to license the original book" (some internal
quotation marks and alterations omitted)).

 

On the other three factors, the Court of Appeals found that the creative
and unpublished nature of Goldsmith\'s photograph favored her, [*id.*,
at 45](); that the amount and substantiality of the portion taken (here,
"the 'essence' " of the photograph) was not reasonable in relation to
the purpose of the use, [*id.*, at 45--47](); and that AWF\'s commercial
licensing encroached on Goldsmith\'s protected market to license her
photograph "to publications for editorial purposes and to other artists
to create derivative works," [*id.*, at
48--51]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00042074754246_ID0EWVCI_1
.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00042074754246_1) The court noted that there
was "no material dispute that both Goldsmith and AWF have sought to
license (and indeed have successfully licensed) their respective
depictions of Prince to popular print magazines to accompany articles
about him." [*Id.*, at 49]() (footnote omitted).

 

Finally, although the District Court had not reached the issue, the
Court of Appeals rejected AWF\'s argument that the Prince Series works
were not substantially similar to Goldsmith\'s photograph. See [*id.*,
at 52--54]().

 

**\*525** Judge Jacobs concurred. He stressed that the Court of Appeals'
holding "d\[id\] not consider, let alone decide, whether the
infringement here encumbers the original Prince Series works." [*Id.*,
at 54](). Instead, "the only use at issue" was "the Foundation\'s
commercial licensing" of images of the Prince Series. [*Id.*, at 55]().

 

This Court granted certiorari. [596 U. S. --------, 142 S.Ct. 1412, 212
L.Ed.2d 402 (2022)]().

 

II

AWF does not challenge the Court of Appeals' holding that Goldsmith\'s
photograph and the Prince Series works are substantially similar. The
question here is whether AWF can defend against a claim of copyright
infringement because it made "fair use" of Goldsmith\'s photograph. [17
U.S.C. § 107]().

 

Although the Court of Appeals analyzed each fair use factor, the only
question before this Court is whether the court below correctly held
that the first factor, "the purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes," **\*\*1273** [§ 107(1)](), weighs in Goldsmith\'s
favor. AWF contends that the Prince Series works are "transformative,"
and that the first factor therefore weighs in its favor, because the
works convey a different meaning or message than the photograph. Brief
for Petitioner 33. The Court of Appeals erred, according to AWF, by not
considering that new expression. *Id.*, at 47--48.

 

[**^\[1\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F12074754246_1)
[**^\[2\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F22074754246_1)But the first fair use factor
instead focuses on whether an allegedly infringing use has a further
purpose or different character, which is a matter of degree, and the
degree of difference must be weighed against other considerations, like
commercialism. [*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579,
114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)](). Although new expression may
be relevant to whether a copying use has a sufficiently distinct purpose
or character, it is not, without more, dispositive of the first factor.

 

**\*526** Here, the specific use of Goldsmith\'s photograph alleged to
infringe her copyright is AWF\'s licensing of Orange Prince to Condé
Nast. As portraits of Prince used to depict Prince in magazine stories
about Prince, the original photograph and AWF\'s copying use of it share
substantially the same purpose. Moreover, the copying use is of a
commercial nature. Even though Orange Prince adds new expression to
Goldsmith\'s photograph, as the District Court found, this Court agrees
with the Court of Appeals that, in the context of the challenged use,
the first fair use factor still favors Goldsmith.

 

A

[**^\[3\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F32074754246_1)The Copyright Act encourages
creativity by granting to the author of an original work "a bundle of
exclusive rights." [*Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enterprises*, 471 U.S. 539, 546, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588
(1985)](); see [U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8]() ("The Congress shall
have Power \... To Promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by
securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right
to their respective Writings and Discoveries"). That bundle includes the
rights to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works,
and, in the case of pictorial or graphic works, to display the
copyrighted work publicly. [17 U.S.C. § 106]().

 

[**^\[4\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F42074754246_1)The Act, however, "reflects a
balance of competing claims upon the public interest: Creative work is
to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately
serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature,
music, and the other arts." [*Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken*,
422 U.S. 151, 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040, 45 L.Ed.2d 84 (1975)](). Copyright
thus trades off the benefits of incentives to create against the costs
of restrictions on copying. The Act, for example, limits the duration of
copyright, §§ 302--305, as required by the Constitution; makes facts and
ideas uncopyrightable, § 102; and limits the scope of copyright owners'
exclusive rights, [§§ 107]()--[122]().

 

This balancing act between creativity and availability (including for
use in new works) is reflected in one such limitation, **\*527** the
defense of "fair use." In 1976, Congress codified the common-law
doctrine of fair use in [§ 107](), which provides: "\[T\]he fair use of
a copyrighted work, \... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news
reporting, teaching \... , scholarship, or research, is not an
infringement of copyright." To determine whether a particular use is
"fair," the statute sets out four factors to be considered:

> "(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
> is of a **\*\*1274** commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational
> purposes;
>
> "(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
>
> "(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
> the copyrighted work as a whole; and
>
> "(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
> the copyrighted work."

[**^\[6\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F62074754246_1)
[**^\[7\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F72074754246_1)The fair use doctrine
"permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute
when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity which that law is
designed to foster." [*Stewart v. Abend*, 495 U.S. 207, 236, 110 S.Ct.
1750, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990)]() (internal quotation marks omitted). The
Act\'s fair use provision, in turn, "set\[s\] forth general principles,
the application of which requires judicial balancing, depending upon
relevant circumstances." [*Google LLC* *v. Oracle America, Inc.*, 593 U.
S. --------, --------, 141 S.Ct. 1183, 1197, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021)]().
Because those principles apply across a wide range of copyrightable
material, from books to photographs to software, fair use is a
"flexible" concept, and "its application may well vary depending on
context." [*Id.*, at --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1197](). For example, in
applying the fair use provision, "copyright\'s protection may be
stronger where the copyrighted material \... serves an artistic rather
than a utilitarian function." [*Ibid.*]()

 

1

[**^\[8\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F82074754246_1)The first fair use factor is
"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of
a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." [§
107(1)](). This **\*528** factor considers the reasons for, and nature
of, the copier\'s use of an original work. The "central" question it
asks is "whether the new work merely 'supersede\[s\] the objects' of the
original creation \... ('supplanting' the original), or instead adds
something new, with a further purpose or different character."
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (quoting [*Folsom v.
Marsh*, 9 F.Cas. 342, 348 (No. 4,901) (C.C.D. Mass. 1841)]() (Story,
J.), and [*Harper & Row*, 471 U.S. at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218]()). In that
way, the first factor relates to the problem of
substitution---copyright\'s bête noire. The use of an original work to
achieve a purpose that is the same as, or highly similar to, that of the
original work is more likely to substitute for, or " 'supplan\[t\],' "
the work, [*ibid*.]()

 

[**^\[9\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F92074754246_1)Consider the "purposes"
listed in the preamble paragraph of [§ 107](): "criticism, comment, news
reporting, teaching \..., scholarship, or research." Although the
examples given are " 'illustrative and not limitative,' " they reflect
"the sorts of copying that courts and Congress most commonly ha\[ve\]
found to be fair uses," and so may guide the first factor inquiry.
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 577--578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting § 101)](). As
the Court of Appeals observed, the "examples are easily understood," as
they contemplate the use of an original work to "serv\[e\] a manifestly
different purpose from the \[work\] itself." [11 F.4th at 37]().
Criticism of a work, for instance, ordinarily does not supersede the
objects of, or supplant, the work. Rather, it uses the work to serve a
distinct end.[]{#co_fnRef_B00052074754246_ID0E1YDI_1
.anchor}[^4^](#co_footnote_B00052074754246_1)

 

[**^\[10\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F102074754246_1)Not every instance will be
clear cut, however. Whether a use shares the **\*\*1275** purpose or
character of an original work, or instead has a further purpose or
different character, is a matter of degree. Most copying has some
further purpose, in **\*529** the sense that copying is socially useful
*ex post*. Many secondary works add something new. That alone does not
render such uses fair. Rather, the first factor (which is just one
factor in a larger analysis) asks "whether *and to what extent*" the use
at issue has a purpose or character different from the original.
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (emphasis added). The
larger the difference, the more likely the first factor weighs in favor
of fair use. The smaller the difference, the less likely.

 

[**^\[11\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F112074754246_1)A use that has a further
purpose or different character is said to be " 'transformative.' "
[*Ibid.*]() (quoting P. Leval, [Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.
Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990)]() (hereinafter Leval)). As before,
"transformativeness" is a matter of degree. See [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at
579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). That is important because the word "transform,"
though not included in [§ 107](), appears elsewhere in the Copyright
Act. The statute defines derivative works, which the copyright owner has
"the exclusive righ\[t\]" to prepare, [§ 106(2)](), to include "any
other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted," §
101. In other words, the owner has a right to derivative transformations
of her work. Such transformations may be substantial, like the
adaptation of a book into a movie. To be sure, this right is
"\[s\]ubject to" fair use. [§ 106](); see also [§ 107](). The two are
not mutually exclusive. But an overbroad concept of transformative use,
one that includes any further purpose, or any different character, would
narrow the copyright owner\'s exclusive right to create derivative
works. To preserve that right, the degree of transformation required to
make "transformative" use of an original must go beyond that required to
qualify as a derivative.[]{#co_fnRef_B00062074754246_ID0EBBAK_1
.anchor}[^5^](#co_footnote_B00062074754246_1)

 

**\*530** For example, this Court in [*Campbell*]() considered whether
parody may be fair use. In holding that it may, the Court explained that
"parody has an obvious claim to transformative value" because "it can
provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in
the process, creating a new one." [510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().
The use at issue in [*Campbell*]() was 2 Live Crew\'s copying of certain
lyrics and musical elements from Roy Orbison\'s song, "Oh, Pretty
Woman," to create a rap derivative titled "Pretty Woman." Without a
doubt, 2 Live Crew transformed Orbison\'s song by adding new lyrics and
musical elements, such that "Pretty Woman" had a new message and
different aesthetic than "Oh, Pretty Woman." Indeed, the whole genre of
music changed from rock ballad to rap. That was not enough for the first
factor to weigh in favor of fair use, however. The Court found it
necessary to determine whether 2 Live Crew\'s transformation of
Orbison\'s song rose to the level of parody, a distinct purpose of
commenting on the original or criticizing it. See [*id.*, at 580--583,
114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

**\*\*1276** Distinguishing between parody (which targets an author or
work for humor or ridicule) and satire (which ridicules society but does
not necessarily target an author or work), the Court further explained
that "\[p\]arody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so
has some claim to use the creation of its victim\'s (or collective
victims') imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and
so requires justification for the very act of borrowing." [*Id.*, at
580--581, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). More generally, when "commentary has no
critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition,
\... the claim to fairness in borrowing from another\'s work **\*531**
diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like
the extent of its commerciality, loom larger." [*Id.*, at 580, 114 S.Ct.
1164](); see also [*id.*, at 597, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (Kennedy, J.,
concurring).

 

[**^\[12\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F122074754246_1)This discussion illustrates
two important points: First, the fact that a use is commercial as
opposed to nonprofit is an additional "element of the first factor."
[*Id.*, at 584, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). The commercial nature of the use is
not dispositive. [*Ibid.*](); [*Google*, 593 U. S., at --------, 141
S.Ct. at 1204](). But it is relevant. As the Court explained in
[*Campbell*](), it is to be weighed against the degree to which the use
has a further purpose or different character. See [510 U.S. at 579, 114
S.Ct. 1164]() ("\[T\]he more transformative the new work, the less will
be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh
against a finding of fair use"); see also [*id.*, at 580, 585, 114 S.Ct.
1164]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00072074754246_ID0EPQAK_1
.anchor}[^6^](#co_footnote_B00072074754246_1)

 

[**^\[13\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F132074754246_1)Second, the first factor
also relates to the justification for the use. In a broad sense, a use
that has a distinct purpose is justified because it furthers the goal of
copyright, namely, to promote the progress of science and the arts,
without diminishing the incentive to create. See [*id.*, at 579, 114
S.Ct. 1164](); [*Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 214
(C.A.2 2015)]() (Leval, J.) ("The more the appropriator is using the
copied material for new, transformative purposes, the more it serves
copyright\'s goal of enriching public knowledge and the less likely it
is that the appropriation will serve as a substitute for the original or
its plausible derivatives, shrinking the protected market opportunities
of the copyrighted work"). A use that shares the purpose of a
copyrighted work, by contrast, is more likely to provide "the public
with a substantial substitute for matter protected by the \[copyright
**\*532** owner\'s\] interests in the original wor\[k\] or derivatives
of \[it\]," [*id.*, at 207](), which undermines the goal of copyright.

 

In a narrower sense, a use may be justified because copying is
reasonably necessary to achieve the user\'s new purpose. Parody, for
example, "needs to mimic an original to make its point." [*Campbell*,
510 U.S. at 580--581, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Similarly, other commentary or
criticism that targets an original work may have compelling reason to "
'conjure up' " the original by borrowing from it. [*Id.*, at 588, 114
S.Ct. 1164]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00082074754246_ID0E5XAK_1
.anchor}[^7^](#co_footnote_B00082074754246_1) **\*\*1277** An
independent justification like this is particularly relevant to
assessing fair use where an original work and copying use share the same
or highly similar purposes, or where wide dissemination of a secondary
work would otherwise run the risk of substitution for the original or
licensed derivatives of it. See [id., at 580 114 S.Ct. 1164](); [*Harper
& Row*, 471 U.S. at 557, 105 S.Ct. 2218](). Once again, the question of
justification is one of degree. See Leval 1111 ("\[I\]t is not
sufficient simply to conclude whether or not justification exists. The
question remains how powerful, or persuasive, is the justification,
because the court must weigh the strength of the secondary user\'s
justification against factors favoring the copyright owner").

 

[**^\[14\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F142074754246_1)In sum, the first fair use
factor considers whether the use of a copyrighted work has a further
purpose or different character, which is a matter of degree, and the
degree of difference must be balanced against the commercial nature of
the use. If an original work and a secondary use share the same or
highly similar purposes, and the secondary use **\*533** is of a
commercial nature, the first factor is likely to weigh against fair use,
absent some other justification for
copying.[]{#co_fnRef_B00092074754246_ID0EB4AK_1
.anchor}[^8^](#co_footnote_B00092074754246_1)

 

2

[**^\[15\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F152074754246_1)The fair use provision, and
the first factor in particular, requires an analysis of the specific
"use" of a copyrighted work that is alleged to be "an infringement." [§
107](). The same copying may be fair when used for one purpose but not
another. See [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164]()
(contrasting the use of a copyrighted work "to advertise a product, even
in a parody," with "the sale of a parody for its own sake, let alone one
performed a single time by students in school"); [*Sony Corp. of America
v. Universal City Studios, Inc.*, 464 U.S. 417, 449--451, 104 S.Ct. 774,
78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984)]() (contrasting the recording of TV "for a
commercial or profit-making purpose" with "private home use").

 

Here, Goldsmith\'s copyrighted photograph has been used in multiple
ways: After Goldsmith licensed the photograph to Vanity Fair to serve as
an artist reference, Warhol used the photograph to create the Vanity
Fair illustration and the other Prince Series works. Vanity Fair then
used the photograph, **\*534** pursuant to the license, when it
published Warhol\'s illustration in 1984. Finally, AWF used the
photograph when it licensed an image of Warhol\'s Orange Prince to Condé
Nast in **\*\*1278** 2016. Only that last use, however, AWF\'s
commercial licensing of Orange Prince to Condé Nast, is alleged to be
infringing.[]{#co_fnRef_B00102074754246_ID0ESIBK_1
.anchor}[^9^](#co_footnote_B00102074754246_1) We limit our analysis
accordingly. In particular, the Court expresses no opinion as to the
creation, display, or sale of any of the original Prince Series
works.[]{#co_fnRef_B00112074754246_ID0E6IBK_1
.anchor}[^10^](#co_footnote_B00112074754246_1)

 

A typical use of a celebrity photograph is to accompany stories about
the celebrity, often in magazines. For example, Goldsmith licensed her
photographs of Prince to illustrate stories about Prince in magazines
such as Newsweek, Vanity Fair, and People. *Supra*, at 1266 -- 1269. She
even licensed **\*535** her photographs for that purpose after Prince
died in 2016. *Supra*, at 1269. A photographer may also license her
creative work to serve as a reference for an artist, like Goldsmith did
in 1984 when Vanity Fair wanted an image of Prince created by Warhol to
illustrate an article about Prince. As noted by the Court of Appeals,
Goldsmith introduced "uncontroverted" evidence "that photographers
generally license others to create stylized derivatives of their work in
the vein of the Prince Series." [11 F.4th at 50](); see 2 App. 291--299.
In fact, Warhol himself paid to license photographs for some of his
artistic renditions. Such licenses, for photographs or derivatives of
them, are how photographers like Goldsmith make a living. They provide
an economic incentive to create original works, which is the goal of
copyright.

[**^\[18\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F182074754246_1)In 2016, AWF licensed an
image of Orange Prince to Condé Nast to appear on the cover of a
commemorative edition magazine about Prince. The edition, titled "The
Genius of Prince," celebrates the life and work of "Prince Rogers
Nelson, 1958--2016." It is undisputed here that the edition is "devoted
to Prince." 2 App. 352. In addition to AWF\'s image on the cover, the
magazine contains numerous concert and studio photographs of Prince. In
that context, the purpose of the image is substantially the same as that
of Goldsmith\'s photograph. Both are portraits of Prince used in
magazines to illustrate stories about
Prince.[]{#co_fnRef_B00122074754246_ID0E5RBK_1

**\*536** **\*\*1279** are not "distinct and different." [*Google*, 593
U. S., at --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1203](). AWF\'s licensing of the Orange
Prince image thus " 'supersede\[d\] the objects,' " [*Campbell*, 510
U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](), *i.e.*, shared the objectives, of

licensed Orange Prince to Condé Nast for **\*\*1280** \$10,000. The
undisputed commercial character of AWF\'s use, though not dispositive,
"tends to weigh against a finding of fair use." [*Harper & Row*, 471

.anchor}[^13^](#co_footnote_B00142074754246_1)

 

Taken together, these two elements---that Goldsmith\'s photograph and
AWF\'s 2016 licensing of Orange Prince share **\*538** substantially the
same purpose, and that AWF\'s use of Goldsmith\'s photo was of a
commercial nature---counsel against fair use, absent some other
justification for copying. That is, although a use\'s transformativeness
may outweigh its commercial character, here, both elements point in the
same direction.[]{#co_fnRef_B00152074754246_ID0EGICK_1
.anchor}[^14^](#co_footnote_B00152074754246_1)

 

The foregoing does not mean, however, that derivative works borrowing
heavily from an original cannot be fair uses. In [*Google*](), the Court
suggested that "\[a\]n 'artistic painting' might, for example, fall
within the scope of fair use even though it precisely replicates a
copyrighted 'advertising logo to make a comment about consumerism.' "
[593 U. S., at -------- -- --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1203]() (quoting 4 M.
Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright § 13.05\[A\]\[1\]\[b\] (2019), in turn
quoting N. Netanel, [Making Sense of Fair Use, 15 Lewis & Clark L. Rev.
715, 746 (2011)]() (some internal quotation marks omitted)). That
suggestion refers to Warhol\'s works that incorporate advertising logos,
such as the Campbell\'s Soup Cans series. See fig. 7, *infra*.

 

**\*539** **\*\*1281**

[​]()

> Figure 7. A print based on the Campbell\'s soup can, one of Warhol\'s
> works that replicates a copyrighted advertising logo.

Yet not all of Warhol\'s works, nor all uses of them, give rise to the
same fair use analysis. In fact, Soup Cans well illustrates the
distinction drawn here. The purpose of Campbell\'s logo is to advertise
soup. Warhol\'s canvases do not share that purpose. Rather, the Soup
Cans series uses Campbell\'s copyrighted work for an artistic commentary
on consumerism, a purpose that is orthogonal to advertising soup. The
use therefore does not supersede the objects of the advertising
logo.[]{#co_fnRef_B00162074754246_ID0EVSCK_1
.anchor}[^15^](#co_footnote_B00162074754246_1)

 

Moreover, a further justification for Warhol\'s use of Campbell\'s logo
is apparent. His Soup Cans series targets the **\*540** logo. That is,
the original copyrighted work is, at least in part, the object of
Warhol\'s commentary. It is the very nature of Campbell\'s copyrighted
logo---well known to the public, designed to be reproduced, and a symbol
of an everyday item for mass consumption---that enables the commentary.
Hence, the use of the copyrighted work not only serves a completely
different purpose, to comment on consumerism rather than to advertise
soup, it also "conjures up" the original work to "she\[d\] light" on the
work itself, not just the subject of the work. [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at
579, 588, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00172074754246_ID0EFVCK_1
.anchor}[^16^](#co_footnote_B00172074754246_1) Here, by contrast, AWF\'s
use of Goldsmith\'s photograph does not target the photograph, nor has
AWF offered another compelling justification for the use. See *infra*,
at 1285 -- 1286, and nn. 20--21.

 

B

AWF contends, however, that the purpose and character of its use of
Goldsmith\'s photograph weighs in favor of fair use because Warhol\'s
silkscreen image of the photograph, like the Campbell\'s Soup Cans
series, has a new meaning or message. The District Court, for example,
understood the Prince Series works to portray Prince as "an iconic,
larger-than-life **\*\*1282** figure." [382 F.Supp.3d at 326](). AWF
also asserts that the works are a comment on celebrity. In particular,
"Warhol\'s Prince Series conveys the dehumanizing nature of celebrity."
Brief for Petitioner 44. According to AWF, that new meaning or message,
which the Court of Appeals ignored, makes the use "transformative"
**\*541** in the fair use sense. See *id.*, at 44--48. We disagree.

 

1

[**^\[19\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F192074754246_1)[*Campbell*]() did describe
a transformative use as one that "alter\[s\] the first \[work\] with new
expression, meaning, or message." [510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]();
see also [*Google*, 593 U. S., at --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203]().
That description paraphrased Judge Leval\'s law review article, which
referred to "new information, new aesthetics, new insights and
understandings." Leval 1111. (Judge Leval contrasted such additions with
secondary uses that "merely repackag\[e\]" the original. *Ibid*.) But
[*Campbell*]() cannot be read to mean that [§ 107(1)]() weighs in favor
of any use that adds some new expression, meaning, or message.

 

Otherwise, "transformative use" would swallow the copyright owner\'s
exclusive right to prepare derivative works. Many derivative works,
including musical arrangements, film and stage adaptions, sequels,
spinoffs, and others that "recast, transfor\[m\] or adap\[t\]" the
original, § 101, add new expression, meaning or message, or provide new
information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings. That is an
intractable problem for AWF\'s interpretation of transformative use. The
first fair use factor would not weigh in favor of a commercial remix of
Prince\'s "Purple Rain" just because the remix added new expression or
had a different aesthetic. A film or musical adaptation, like that of
Alice Walker\'s The Color Purple, might win awards for its "significant
creative contribution"; alter the meaning of a classic novel; and add
"important new expression," such as images, performances, original
music, and lyrics. *Post*, at 1297 -- 1298, 1304 (KAGAN, J., dissenting)
(internal quotation marks omitted). But that does not in itself dispense
with the need for licensing.[]{#co_fnRef_B00182074754246_ID0EX6CK_1
.anchor}[^17^](#co_footnote_B00182074754246_1)

 

**\*542** [*Campbell*]() is again instructive. 2 Live Crew\'s version of
Orbison\'s song easily conveyed a new meaning or message. It also had a
different aesthetic. Yet the Court went further, examining whether and
to what extent 2 Live Crew\'s song had the parodic purpose of
"commenting on the original or criticizing it." [510 U.S. at 583, 114
S.Ct. 1164](). Parody is, of course, a kind of message. Moreover, the
Court considered what the words of the songs might have meant to
determine whether parody "reasonably could be perceived." [*Ibid.*]()
But new meaning or message was not sufficient. If it had been, the Court
could have made quick work of the first fair use factor. Instead,
meaning or message was simply relevant to whether the new use served a
purpose distinct from the original, or instead superseded its objects.
That was, **\*\*1283** and is, the "central" question under the first
factor. [*Id.*, at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

The dissent commits the same interpretive error as AWF: It focuses on
[*Campbell*]()'s paraphrase, yet ignores the rest of that decision\'s
careful reasoning. Indeed, upon reading the dissent, someone might be
surprised to learn that [*Campbell*]() was about parody at all. Had
expert testimony confirmed the obvious fact that 2 Live Crew\'s "Pretty
Woman" differed in aesthetics and meaning from Orbison\'s original, that
would have been the end of the dissent\'s analysis. See *post*, at 1299
-- 1301 (opinion of KAGAN, J.). Not the Court\'s, however.
[*Campbell*]() was the culmination of a long line of cases and
scholarship about parody\'s claim to fairness in borrowing. "For
purposes of copyright law," the Court explained, "the heart of any
parodist\'s claim to quote from existing material **\*543** is the use
of some elements of a prior author\'s composition to create a new one
that, at least in part, comments on that author\'s works." [510 U.S. at
580, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). [*Campbell*]() thus drew a nuanced distinction
between parody and satire: While parody cannot function unless it
conjures up the original, "satire can stand on its own two feet and so
requires justification for \... borrowing." [*Id.*, at 580--581, 114
S.Ct. 1164](). The objective meaning or message of 2 Live Crew\'s song
was relevant to this inquiry into the reasons for copying, but any "new
expression, meaning, or message" was not the
test.[]{#co_fnRef_B00192074754246_ID0ESODK_1
.anchor}[^18^](#co_footnote_B00192074754246_1)

 

What role meaning or message played in the Court of Appeals' analysis
here is not entirely clear. The court correctly rejected the idea "that
any secondary work that adds a new aesthetic or new expression to its
source material is necessarily transformative." [11 F.4th at 38--39]().
It also appeared correctly to accept that meaning or message is relevant
to, but not dispositive of, purpose. See [*id.*, at 41]() ("\[T\]he
secondary work itself must reasonably be perceived as embodying a
distinct artistic purpose, one that conveys a new meaning or message
separate from its source material"); [*id.*, at 42]() ("\[T\]he judge
must examine whether the secondary work\'s use of its source material is
in service of a fundamentally different and new artistic purpose and
character, \[which\] must, at a bare minimum, comprise something more
**\*544** than the imposition of another artist\'s style on the primary
work \... " (internal quotation marks omitted)).

 

[**^\[20\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F202074754246_1)Elsewhere, however, the
Court of Appeals stated that "the district judge should not assume the
role of art critic and seek to ascertain the intent behind or meaning of
the works at issue." [*Id.*, at 41](). That statement is correct in
part. A court should not attempt to evaluate the artistic significance
of a particular work. See [*Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.*,
188 U.S. 239, 251, 23 S.Ct. 298, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903)]() (Holmes, J.)
("It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the
law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of \[a work\],
outside of **\*\*1284** the narrowest and most obvious
limits").[]{#co_fnRef_B00202074754246_ID0EL1DK_1
.anchor}[^19^](#co_footnote_B00202074754246_1) Nor does the subjective
intent of the user (or the subjective interpretation of a court)
determine the purpose of the use. But the meaning of a secondary work,
as reasonably can be perceived, should be considered to the extent
necessary to determine whether the purpose of the use is distinct from
**\*545** the original, for instance, because the use comments on,
criticizes, or provides otherwise unavailable information about the
original, see, *e.g.*, [*Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 215--216]().

 

2

The District Court determined that "\[t\]he Prince Series works can
reasonably be perceived to have transformed Prince from a vulnerable,
uncomfortable person to an iconic, larger-than-life figure." [382
F.Supp.3d at 326](). To make that determination, the District Court
relied, in part, on testimony by Goldsmith that her photographs of
Prince show that he "is 'not a comfortable person' and that he is 'a
vulnerable human being.' " [*Ibid.*]() An expert on Warhol, meanwhile,
testified that the Prince Series works depict "Prince as a kind of icon
or totem of something," a "mask-like simulacrum of his actual
existence." 1 App. 249, 257.

 

[**^\[21\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F212074754246_1)
[**^\[22\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F222074754246_1)The Court of Appeals noted,
correctly, that "whether a work is transformative cannot turn merely on
the stated or perceived intent of the artist or the meaning or
impression that a critic---or for that matter, a judge---draws from the
work." [11 F.4th at 41](). "\[O\]therwise, the law may well
'recogniz\[e\] any alteration as transformative.' " [*Ibid.*]() (quoting
4 Nimmer, Copyright § 13.05\[B\]\[6\]). Whether the purpose and
character of a use weighs in favor of fair use is, instead, an objective
inquiry into what use was made, *i.e.*, what the user does with the
original work.

 

Granting the District Court\'s conclusion that Orange Prince reasonably
can be perceived to portray Prince as iconic, whereas Goldsmith\'s
portrayal is photorealistic, that difference must be evaluated in the
context of the specific use at issue. The use is AWF\'s commercial
licensing of Orange Prince to appear on the cover of Condé Nast\'s
special commemorative edition. The purpose of that use is, still, to
illustrate a magazine about Prince with a portrait of Prince. Although
the purpose could be more specifically described as illustrating a
magazine about Prince with a portrait of **\*546** Prince, one that
portrays Prince somewhat differently from Goldsmith\'s photograph (yet
has no critical bearing on her photograph), **\*\*1285** that degree of
difference is not enough for the first factor to favor AWF, given the
specific context of the use.

 

To hold otherwise would potentially authorize a range of commercial
copying of photographs, to be used for purposes that are substantially
the same as those of the originals. As long as the user somehow portrays
the subject of the photograph differently, he could make modest
alterations to the original, sell it to an outlet to accompany a story
about the subject, and claim transformative use. Many photographs will
be open to various interpretations. A subject as open to interpretation
as the human face, for example, reasonably can be perceived as conveying
several possible meanings. The application of an artist\'s
characteristic style to bring out a particular meaning that was
available in the photograph is less likely to constitute a "further
purpose" as [*Campbell*]() used the term. [510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164]().

 

AWF asserts another, albeit related, purpose, which is to comment on the
"dehumanizing nature" and "effects" of celebrity. Brief for Petitioner
44, 51. No doubt, many of Warhol\'s works, and particularly his uses of
repeated images, can be perceived as depicting celebrities as
commodities. But again, even if such commentary is perceptible on the
cover of Condé Nast\'s tribute to "Prince Rogers Nelson, 1958--2016," on
the occasion of the man\'s death, AWF has a problem: The asserted
commentary is at [*Campbell*]()'s lowest ebb. Because it "has no
critical bearing on" Goldsmith\'s
photograph,[]{#co_fnRef_B00212074754246_ID0ECLEK_1
.anchor}[^20^](#co_footnote_B00212074754246_1) the commentary\'s "claim
to fairness in borrowing **\*547** from" her work "diminishes
accordingly (if it does not vanish)." [510 U.S. at 580, 114 S.Ct.
1164]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00222074754246_ID0EWMEK_1
.anchor}[^21^](#co_footnote_B00222074754246_1) The commercial nature of
the use, on the other hand, "loom\[s\] larger." [*Ibid.*]()

 

Here, the circumstances of AWF\'s 2016 licensing outweigh its diminished
claim to fairness in copying under the first factor. Like satire that
does not target an original work, AWF\'s asserted commentary "can stand
on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of
borrowing." [*Id.*, at 581, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Moreover, because AWF\'s
commercial use of Goldsmith\'s photograph to illustrate a magazine about
Prince is so similar to the photograph\'s typical use, a particularly
compelling justification is needed. Yet AWF offers no independent
justification, let alone a compelling one, for copying the photograph,
other than to convey a new **\*\*1286** meaning or message. As
explained, that alone is not enough for the first factor to favor fair
use.

 

Copying might have been helpful to convey a new meaning or message. It
often is. But that does not suffice under the first factor. Nor does it
distinguish AWF from a long list of would-be fair users: a musician who
finds it helpful to **\*548** sample another artist\'s song to make his
own, a playwright who finds it helpful to adapt a novel, or a filmmaker
who would prefer to create a sequel or spinoff, to name just a
few.[]{#co_fnRef_B00232074754246_ID0ENVEK_1
.anchor}[^22^](#co_footnote_B00232074754246_1) As Judge Leval has
explained, "\[a\] secondary author is not necessarily at liberty to make
wholesale takings of the original author\'s expression merely because of
how well the original author\'s expression would convey the secondary
author\'s different message." [*Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 215]().

The dissent would rather not debate these finer points. See *post*, at
1293, n. 2 (opinion of KAGAN, J.). It offers no theory of the
relationship between transformative uses of original works and
derivative works that transform originals. No reason why AWF was
justified in using Goldsmith\'s original work in this specific instance.
And no limiting principle for its apparent position that any use that is
creative prevails under the first fair use factor. Instead, the dissent
makes the simple (and obvious) point that restrictions on copying can
inhibit follow-on works. " 'Nothing comes from nothing,' " the dissent
observes, " 'nothing ever could.' " *Post*, at 1297. So somewhere in the
copyright statute, there must be an "escape valve" to create something
good. *Post*, at 1298. If AWF must pay Goldsmith to use *her* creation,
the dissent claims, this will "stifle creativity of every sort," "thwart
the expression of new ideas and the attainment of new knowledge," and
"make our world poorer." *Post*, at 1312.

 

**\*549** These claims will not age well. It will not impoverish our
world to require AWF to pay Goldsmith a fraction of the proceeds from
its reuse of her copyrighted work. Recall, payments like these are
incentives for artists to create original works in the first place. Nor
will the Court\'s decision, which is consistent with longstanding
principles of fair use, snuff out the light of Western civilization,
returning us to the Dark Ages of a world without Titian, Shakespeare, or
Richard Rodgers. The dissent goes on at length about the basic premise
that copyright (like other forms of intellectual property) involves a
tradeoff between stimulating innovative activity, on the one hand, and
allowing follow-on innovation, on the other. See *post*, at 1297 --
1298, and n. 4, 1304 -- 1312. This theme will be familiar to any student
of copyright law. In tracing the history of Renaissance painting,
however, the dissent loses sight of the statute and this Court\'s cases.
The Lives of the Artists undoubtedly makes for livelier reading than the
U. S. Code or the U. S. Reports, but as a court, we do not have that
luxury.

 

The dissent thus misses the forest for a tree. Its single-minded focus
on the value of copying ignores the value of original works. It ignores
the statute\'s focus on the **\*\*1287** specific use alleged to be
infringing. See n. 10, *supra*. It waves away the statute\'s concern for
derivative works. *Supra*, at 1281 -- 1283, and n. 17. It fails to
appreciate [*Campbell*]()'s nuance. *Supra*, at 1282 -- 1283, 1285, n.
21. And it disregards this Court\'s repeated emphasis on justification.
*Supra*, at 1282 -- 1283, and n. 18, 1285, n. 21.

 

The result of these omissions is an account of fair use that is
unbalanced in theory and, perhaps relatedly, in tone. The dissent\'s
conclusion---that whenever a use adds new meaning or message, or
constitutes creative progress in the opinion of a critic or judge, the
first fair use factor weighs in its favor---does not follow from its
basic premise. Fair use instead strikes a balance between original works
and secondary uses based in part on objective indicia of the use\'s
purpose **\*550** and character, including whether the use is commercial
and, importantly, the reasons for copying.

 

Finally, copyright law is replete with escape valves: the
idea--expression distinction; the general rule that facts may not
receive protection; the requirement of originality; the legal standard
for actionable copying; the limited duration of copyright; and, yes, the
defense of fair use, including all its factors, such as whether the
amount taken is reasonable in relation to the purpose of the use. These
doctrines (and others) provide ample space for artists and other
creators to use existing materials to make valuable new works. They
account for most, if not all, of the examples given by the dissent, as
well as the dissent\'s own copying (and the Court\'s, too). If the last
century of American art, literature, music, and film is any indication,
the existing copyright law, of which today\'s opinion is a continuation,
is a powerful engine of creativity.

 

III

Lynn Goldsmith\'s original works, like those of other photographers, are
entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists. Such
protection includes the right to prepare derivative works that transform
the original. The use of a copyrighted work may nevertheless be fair if,
among other things, the use has a purpose and character that is
sufficiently distinct from the original. In this case, however,
Goldsmith\'s original photograph of Prince, and AWF\'s copying use of
that photograph in an image licensed to a special edition magazine
devoted to Prince, share substantially the same purpose, and the use is
of a commercial nature. AWF has offered no other persuasive
justification for its unauthorized use of the photograph. Therefore, the
"purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes," [§
107(1)](), weighs in Goldsmith\'s favor.

 

[**^\[23\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F232074754246_1)The Court has cautioned
that the four statutory fair use factors may not "be treated in
isolation, one from another. **\*551** All are to be explored, and the
results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). AWF does not challenge
the Court of Appeals' determinations that the second factor, "the nature
of the copyrighted work," [§ 107(2)](); third factor, "the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as a whole," [§ 107(3)](); and fourth factor, "the effect of the use
upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work," all
favor Goldsmith. See [11 F.4th at 45--51](). Because this Court agrees
with the Court of Appeals that the first factor likewise favors her, the
judgment of the Court of Appeals is

 

*Affirmed.*

 

**\*552** **\*\*1288** APPENDIX

[​]()

Andy Warhol created 16 works based on Lynn Goldsmith\'s photograph: 14
silkscreen prints and two pencil drawings. The works are collectively
known as the Prince Series.

Justice [GORSUCH](), with whom Justice [JACKSON]() joins, concurring.

**\*553** The question before us is a narrow one of statutory
interpretation. It concerns the meaning of one of four factors Congress
has instructed courts to consult when a party invokes the affirmative
defense of "fair use" to a claim of copyright infringement. The
statutory factor in question requires courts to consider "the purpose
and character of the use." [17 U.S.C. § 107(1)](). The parties disagree
which "purpose" and "character" counts.

 

On the Foundation\'s telling, the statute requires courts to focus on
the purpose the *creator* had in mind when producing his **\*\*1289**
work and the character of his resulting work. So what matters in this
case is that Andy Warhol intended to apply a " 'new aesthetic' " to Lynn
Goldsmith\'s photograph and the character of his work " 'transformed' "
Prince from the " 'vulnerable, uncomfortable person' " depicted in Ms.
Goldsmith\'s photograph into " 'an iconic, larger-than-life figure.' "
*Ante*, at 1271; *post,* at 1294 -- 1297, 1301 (KAGAN, J., dissenting).
Because the purpose and character of Mr. Warhol\'s work is so different
from Ms. Goldsmith\'s, the Foundation insists, the first statutory
factor points in favor of finding a fair-use affirmative defense.

 

By contrast, on Ms. Goldsmith\'s reading of the law and under the Second
Circuit\'s approach, the first fair-use factor requires courts to assess
the purpose and character of the *challenged use*. *Ante,* at 1277 --
1278. The Foundation now owns Mr. Warhol\'s image of Prince and it
recently sought to license that image to a magazine looking for a
depiction of Prince to accompany an article about Prince. *Ibid.* Ms.
Goldsmith seeks to license her copyrighted photograph to exactly these
kinds of buyers. And because the purpose and character of the
Foundation\'s challenged use and the purpose and character of her own
protected use overlap so completely, Ms. Goldsmith argues that the first
**\*554** statutory factor does not support a fair-use affirmative
defense.

 

As I see it, the second view of the law is the better one. Nothing in
the copyright statute calls on judges to speculate about the purpose an
artist may have in mind when working on a particular project. Nothing in
the law requires judges to try their hand at art criticism and assess
the aesthetic character of the resulting work. Instead, the first
statutory fair-use factor instructs courts to focus on "the purpose and
character *of the use*, including whether *such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes*." [§ 107(1)]()
(emphases added). By its terms, the law trains our attention on the
particular use under challenge. And it asks us to assess whether the
purpose and character of that use is different from (and thus
complements) or is the same as (and thus substitutes for) a copyrighted
work. It\'s a comparatively modest inquiry focused on how and for what
reason a person is using a copyrighted work in the world, not on the
moods of any artist or the aesthetic quality of any creation.

 

To my mind, three contextual clues confirm that this reading of the
statutory text is the correct one.

 

First, the statutory preamble to all four fair-use factors instructs
courts to assess whether the person asserting a fair-use defense seeks
to "use" a copyrighted work "for *purposes* such as criticism, comment,
news reporting, teaching \..., scholarship, or research." [§ 107]()
(emphasis added). Once more, the statute indicates that a court must
examine the purpose of the particular use under challenge, not the
artistic purpose underlying a work. And once more, the statute tasks
courts with asking whether the challenged use serves a different purpose
(as, say, a "criticism" of or "comment" on the original) or whether it
seeks to serve the same purpose (as a substitute for the original).

 

Second, the copyright statute expressly protects a copyright holder\'s
exclusive right to create "derivative works" **\*555** that
"transfor\[m\]" or "adap\[t\]" his original work. [§§ 101](),
[106(2)](). So saying that a later user of a copyrighted work
"transformed" its message and endowed it with a "new aesthetic" cannot
automatically mean he has made fair use of it. Contra, *post,* at 1291
-- 1292, 1303 -- 1304, 1310 -- 1312 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). To hold
otherwise would risk making a nonsense of the statutory
scheme---suggesting that transformative **\*\*1290** uses of originals
belong to the copyright holder (under [§ 106]()) but that others may
simultaneously claim those transformative uses for themselves (under [§
107]()). We aren\'t normally in the business of putting a statute "at
war with itself" in this way. [*United States v. American Tobacco Co.*,
221 U.S. 106, 180, 31 S.Ct. 632, 55 L.Ed. 663 (1911)]().

 

Finally, the fourth fair-use factor requires courts to assess "the
effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work." [§ 107(4)](). This Court has described the fourth
factor as the "most important" one. [*Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v.
Nation Enterprises*, 471 U.S. 539, 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588
(1985)](). This Court has said, too, that no factor may "be treated in
isolation, one from another." [*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510
U.S. 569, 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)](). Nor does
anything in the fourth factor call on courts to speculate about artistic
ambitions or aesthetics. Instead, it requires courts to ask whether
consumers treat a challenged use "as a market replacement" for a
copyrighted work or a market complement that does not impair demand for
the original. [*Id.*, at 591, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Reading [§ 107]() as a
whole, then, it supplies courts with a sequential chain of questions
about the particular *challenged use*---starting with its *purpose* and
*character* (in the first factor) and ending with its *effect* (in the
fourth). There is no double counting here. Contra, *post*, at 1303 --
1304 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Instead, the statute proceeds from step to
step, asking judges to assess whether the challenged use (as revealed by
its purpose, character, amount of source material used, and effect)
serves as a complement to or a substitute for a copyrighted work.

 

**\*556** With all this in mind, the Court\'s decision seems to me
exactly right. Does Mr. Warhol\'s image seek to depict Prince as a
"larger-than-life" icon while Ms. Goldsmith\'s photograph attempts to
cast him in a more "vulnerable" light? See *ante,* at 1281 -- 1286;
*post*, at 1296 -- 1297, 1311 -- 1312 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Or are
the artistic purposes latent in the two images and their aesthetic
character actually more similar than that? Happily, the law does not
require judges to tangle with questions so far beyond our competence.
Instead, the first fair-use factor requires courts to assess only
whether the purpose and character of the *challenged use* is the same as
a protected use. And here, the undisputed facts reveal that the
Foundation sought to use its image as a commercial substitute for Ms.
Goldsmith\'s photograph. Of course, competitive products often differ in
material respects and a buyer may find these differences reason to
prefer one offering over another. Cf. *post,* at 1296 -- 1297, 1301
(KAGAN, J., dissenting). But under the first fair-use factor the salient
point is that the purpose and character of the Foundation\'s use
involved competition with Ms. Goldsmith\'s image. To know that much is
to know the first fair-use factor favors Ms. Goldsmith.

 

It is equally important, however, to acknowledge what this case does not
involve and what the Court does not decide. Worried about the fate of
artists seeking to portray reclining nudes or papal authorities, or
authors hoping to build on classic literary themes? *Post*, at 1305 --
1312 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Worry not. This case does not call on us
to strike a balance between rewarding creators and enabling others to
build on their work. That is Congress\'s job. See [U. S. Const., Art. I,
§ 8, cl. 8](). Nor does this case even call on us to interpret and apply
many of the reticulated elements of the Copyright Act that Congress has
adopted to balance these competing interests. Our only job today is to
interpret and apply faithfully one statutory factor among many Congress
**\*\*1291** has deemed relevant to the affirmative defense of fair use.

 

**\*557** That observation points the way to another. The Court today
does not even decide whether the Foundation\'s image of Prince infringes
on Ms. Goldsmith\'s copyright. To uphold a claim of infringement under
the Copyright Act, a court must find the defendant copied elements of
the plaintiff 's work that are themselves original. [*Feist
Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 361,
111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991)](). As part of this process, a
court must isolate and vindicate only the truly original elements of a
copyrighted work. See 2 Nimmer on Copyright § 8.01\[D\] (2022). The
plaintiff must usually show not only a similarity but a "substantial"
similarity between the allegedly infringing work and the original
elements of his own copyrighted work. See 4 Nimmer on Copyright §
13.03\[A\] (2023). And even when two works *are* substantially similar,
if both the plaintiff 's and the defendant\'s works copy from a third
source (reworking, say, a traditional artistic or literary theme), a
claim for infringement generally will not succeed. See 2 Nimmer on
Copyright § 8.01\[C\]. In this case, we address none of these questions
or other elements of the infringement standard designed to ensure room
for later artists to build on the work of their predecessors. The
district court concluded that it "need not address" the merits of Ms.
Goldsmith\'s infringement claim because the Foundation could prevail at
summary judgment on its affirmative defense of fair use. [382 F.Supp.3d
312, 324 (SDNY 2019)](). The Second Circuit reversed, focused primarily
on the district court\'s "application of the four fair-use factors." [11
F.4th 26, 32 (2021)](); see [*id.,* at 36--52](). And this Court granted
review to decide only the question of fair use and only the role of a
single factor in that affirmative defense. [596 U. S. --------, 142
S.Ct. 1412, 212 L.Ed.2d 402 (2022)]().

 

Last but hardly least, while our interpretation of the first fair-use
factor does not favor the Foundation in this case, it may in others. If,
for example, the Foundation had sought to display Mr. Warhol\'s image of
Prince in a nonprofit museum **\*558** or a for-profit book commenting
on 20th-century art, the purpose and character of that use might well
point to fair use. But those cases are not this case. Before us, Ms.
Goldsmith challenges only the Foundation\'s effort to use its portrait
as a commercial substitute for her own protected photograph in sales to
magazines looking for images of Prince to accompany articles about the
musician. And our only point today is that, while the Foundation may
often have a fair-use defense for Mr. Warhol\'s work, that does not mean
it always will. Under the law Congress has given us, each challenged use
must be assessed on its own terms.

 

Justice [KAGAN](), with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.

Today, the Court declares that Andy Warhol\'s eye-popping silkscreen of
Prince---a work based on but dramatically altering an existing
photograph---is (in copyright lingo) not "transformative." Still more,
the Court decides that even if Warhol\'s portrait were
transformative---even if its expression and meaning were worlds away
from the photo---that fact would not matter. For in the majority\'s
view, copyright law\'s first fair-use factor---addressing "the purpose
and character" of "the use made of a work"---is uninterested in the
distinctiveness and newness of Warhol\'s portrait. [17 U.S.C. § 107]().
What matters under that factor, the majority says, is instead a
marketing decision: In the majority\'s **\*\*1292** view, Warhol\'s
licensing of the silkscreen to a magazine precludes fair
use.[]{#co_fnRef_B00242074754246_ID0EXFGK_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00242074754246_1)

 

You\'ve probably heard of Andy Warhol; you\'ve probably seen his art.
You know that he reframed and reformulated---in a word,
transformed---images created first by others. Campbell\'s soup cans and
Brillo boxes. Photos of celebrity icons: Marilyn, Elvis, Jackie,
Liz---and, as most **\*559** relevant here, Prince. That\'s how Warhol
earned his conspicuous place in every college\'s Art History 101. So it
may come as a surprise to see the majority describe the Prince
silkscreen as a "modest alteration\[ \]" of Lynn Goldsmith\'s
photograph---the result of some "crop\[ping\]" and
"flatten\[ing\]"---with the same "essential nature." *Ante*, at 1270,
1280, n. 14, 1284 -- 1285 (emphasis deleted). Or more generally, to
observe the majority\'s lack of appreciation for the way his works
differ in both aesthetics and message from the original templates. In a
recent decision, this Court used Warhol paintings as the perfect
exemplar of a "copying use that adds something new and important"---of a
use that is "transformative," and thus points toward a finding of fair
use. [*Google LLC* *v. Oracle America, Inc.*, 593 U. S. --------,
-------- -- --------, 141 S.Ct. 1183, 1202-1203, 209 L.Ed.2d 311
(2021)](). That Court would have told this one to go back to school.

 

What is worse, that refresher course would apparently be insufficient.
For it is not just that the majority does not realize how much Warhol
added; it is that the majority does not care. In adopting that posture
of indifference, the majority does something novel (though in law,
unlike in art, it is rarely a good thing to be transformative). Before
today, we assessed "the purpose and character" of a copier\'s use by
asking the following question: Does the work "add\[ \] something new,
with a further purpose or different character, altering the \[original\]
with new expression, meaning, or message"? [*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose
Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994)](); see [*Google*, 593 U. S., at --------, 141 S.Ct. at
1202-1203](). When it did so to a significant degree, we called the work
"transformative" and held that the fair-use test\'s first factor favored
the copier (though other factors could outweigh that one). But today\'s
decision---all the majority\'s protestations notwithstanding---leaves
our first-factor inquiry in shambles. The majority holds that because
Warhol licensed his work to a magazine---as Goldsmith sometimes also
did---the first factor goes against him. See, *e.g.*, *ante*, at 1285 --
1286. It does not matter how different the Warhol is from the original
photo---how much **\*560** "new expression, meaning, or message" he
added. It does not matter that the silkscreen and the photo do not have
the same aesthetic characteristics and do not convey the same meaning.
It does not matter that because of those dissimilarities, the magazine
publisher did not view the one as a substitute for the other. All that
matters is that Warhol and the publisher entered into a licensing
transaction, similar to one Goldsmith might have done. Because the
artist had such a commercial purpose, all the creativity in the world
could not save him.

 

That doctrinal shift ill serves copyright\'s core purpose. The law does
not grant artists (and authors and composers and so on) exclusive
rights---that is, monopolies---for their own sake. It does so to foster
creativity---"\[t\]o promote the \[p\]rogress" of both arts and science.
[U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8](). And for that same reason, the law
also protects the fair use of copyrighted **\*\*1293** material. Both
Congress and the courts have long recognized that an overly stringent
copyright regime actually "stifle\[s\]" creativity by preventing artists
from building on the work of others. [*Stewart v. Abend*, 495 U.S. 207,
236, 110 S.Ct. 1750, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990)]() (internal quotation marks
omitted); see [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 578--579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). For,
let\'s be honest, artists don\'t create all on their own; they cannot do
what they do without borrowing from or otherwise making use of the work
of others. That is the way artistry of all kinds---visual, musical,
literary---happens (as it is the way knowledge and invention generally
develop). The fair-use test\'s first factor responds to that truth: As
understood in our precedent, it provides "breathing space" for artists
to use existing materials to make fundamentally new works, for the
public\'s enjoyment and benefit. [*Id.*, at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). In
now remaking that factor, and thus constricting fair use\'s boundaries,
the majority hampers creative progress and undermines creative freedom.
I respectfully dissent.[]{#co_fnRef_B00252074754246_ID0EVQGK_1

**\*561** I

A

Andy Warhol is the avatar of transformative copying. Cf. [*Google*, 593
U. S., at -------- -- --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203]() (selecting
Warhol, from the universe of creators, to illustrate what transformative
copying is). In his early career, Warhol worked as a commercial
illustrator and became experienced in varied techniques of reproduction.
By night, he used those techniques---in particular, the silkscreen---to
create his own art. His own---even though in one sense not. The
silkscreen enabled him to make brilliantly novel art out of existing
"images carefully selected from popular culture." D. De Salvo, God Is in
the Details, in Andy Warhol Prints 22 (4th rev. ed. 2003). The works he
produced, connecting traditions of fine art with mass culture, depended
on "appropriation\[s\]": The use of "elements of an extant image\[ \] is
Warhol\'s entire modus operandi." B. Gopnik, Artistic Appropriation vs.
Copyright Law, N. Y. Times, Apr. 6, 2021, p. C4 (internal quotation
marks omitted). And with that m.o., he changed modern art; his
appropriations and his originality were flipsides of each other. To a
public accustomed to thinking of art as formal works "belong\[ing\] in
gold frames"---disconnected from the everyday world of products and
personalities---Warhol\'s paintings landed like a thunderclap. A. Danto,
Andy Warhol 36 (2009). Think Soup Cans or, in another vein, think Elvis.
Warhol had created "something very **\*562** new"---"shockingly
important, transformative art." B. Gopnik, Warhol 138 (2020); Gopnik,
Artistic Appropriation.

 

To see the method in action, consider one of Warhol\'s pre-Prince
celebrity silkscreens---this one, of Marilyn Monroe. He began with a
publicity photograph of the actress. And then he went to work. He
reframed the image, zooming in on Monroe\'s face to "produc\[e\] the
disembodied **\*\*1294** effect of a cinematic close-up." 1 App. 161
(expert declaration).

 

[​]()

At that point, he produced a high-contrast, flattened image on a sheet
of clear acetate. He used that image to trace an outline on the canvas.
And he painted on top---applying exotic colors with "a flat, even
consistency and an industrial appearance." *Id.*, at 165. The same
high-contrast image was then reproduced in negative on a silkscreen,
designed to function as a selectively porous mesh. Warhol would "place
the screen face down on the canvas, pour ink onto the back of the mesh,
and use a squeegee to pull the ink through the weave and onto the
canvas." *Id.*, at 164. On some of his Marilyns (there are many), he
reordered the process---first ink, then color, then (perhaps) ink again.
See **\*563** *id.*, at 165--166. The result---see for yourself---is
miles away from a literal copy of the publicity photo.

And the meaning is different from any the photo had. Of course, meaning
in great art is contestable and contested (as is the premise that an
artwork is great). But note what some experts say about the complex
message(s) Warhol\'s Marilyns convey. On one level, those vivid,
larger-than-life paintings are celebrity iconography, making a "secular,
profane subject\[ \]" "transcendent" and "eternal." *Id.*, at 209
(internal quotation marks omitted). But they also function as a biting
critique of the cult of celebrity, and the role it plays in American
life. With misaligned, "Day-Glo" **\*\*1295** colors suggesting
"artificiality and industrial production," Warhol portrayed the actress
as a "consumer product." The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide 233
(2012); The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Marilyn (2023) (online source
archived at https://www.supremecourt.gov). And in so doing, he "exposed
the deficiencies" of a "mass-media culture" in which **\*564** "such
superficial icons loom so large." 1 App. 208, 210 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Out of a publicity photo came both memorable portraiture
and pointed social commentary.

 

As with Marilyn, similarly with Prince. In 1984, Vanity Fair
commissioned Warhol to create a portrait based on a black-and-white
photograph taken by noted photographer Lynn Goldsmith:

 

[​]()

As he did in the Marilyn series, Warhol cropped the photo, so that
Prince\'s head fills the whole frame: It thus becomes "disembodied," as
if "magically suspended in space." *Id.*, at 174. And as before, Warhol
converted the cropped photo into a higher-contrast image, incorporated
into a silkscreen. That image isolated and exaggerated the darkest
details of Prince\'s head; it also reduced his "natural, angled
position," presenting him in a more face-forward way. *Id.*, at 223.
Warhol traced, painted, and inked, as earlier described. See *supra*, at
1293 -- 1294. He also made a second silkscreen, based on his tracings;
the ink he passed through that screen left differently **\*565**
colored, out-of-kilter lines around Prince\'s face and hair (a bit hard
to see in the reproduction below---more pronounced in the original).
Altogether, Warhol made 14 prints and two drawings---the Prince
series---in a range of unnatural, lurid hues. See Appendix, *ante*, at
1288. Vanity Fair chose the Purple Prince to accompany an article on the
musician. Thirty-two years later, just after Prince died, Condé Nast
paid Warhol (now actually his foundation, see *supra*, at 1292, n. 1) to
use the Orange Prince on the cover of a special commemorative magazine.
A picture (or two), as the saying goes, is worth a thousand words, so
here is what those magazines published:

**\*\*1296**

> canvas

It does not take an art expert to see a transformation---but in any
event, all those offering testimony in this case agreed there was one.
The experts explained, in far greater detail than I have, the laborious
and painstaking work that Warhol put into these and other portraits. See
1 App. 160--185, 212--216, 222--224. They described, in ways I have
tried to suggest, the resulting visual differences between the photo and
the silkscreen. As one summarized the matter: **\*566** The two works
are "materially distinct" in "their composition, presentation, color
palette, and media"---*i.e.*, in pretty much all their aesthetic traits.
*Id.*, at 227.[]{#co_fnRef_B00262074754246_ID0ECEHK_1
.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00262074754246_1) And with the change in
form came an undisputed change in meaning. Goldsmith\'s focus---seen in
what one expert called the "corporeality and luminosity" of her
depiction---was on Prince\'s "unique human identity." *Id.*, at 176,
227. Warhol\'s focus was more nearly the opposite. His subject was "not
the private person but the public image." *Id.*, at 159. The artist\'s
"flattened, cropped, exotically colored, and unnatural depiction of
Prince\'s disembodied head" sought to "communicate a message about the
impact of celebrity" in contemporary life. *Id.*, at 227. On Warhol\'s
canvas, Prince emerged as "spectral, dark, \[and\] uncanny"---less a
real person than a "mask-like simulacrum." *Id.*, at 187, 249. He was
reframed as a "larger than life" "icon or totem." *Id.*, at 257. Yet he
was also reduced: He became the product of a "publicity machine" that
"packages and disseminates commoditized images." *Id.*, at 160. He
manifested, in short, the dehumanizing culture of celebrity in America.
The message could not have been more different.

 

A thought experiment may pound the point home. Suppose you were the
editor of Vanity Fair or Condé Nast, publishing an article about Prince.
You need, of course, some kind of picture. An employee **\*\*1297**
comes to you with two options: the Goldsmith photo, the Warhol portrait.
Would you say that you don\'t really care? That the employee is free to
flip a coin? In the majority\'s view, you apparently would. **\*567**
Its opinion, as further discussed below, is built on the idea that both
are just "portraits of Prince" that may equivalently be "used to depict
Prince in magazine stories about Prince." *Ante*, at 1273; see *ante*,
at 1278 -- 1279, and n. 11, 1281, n. 15, 1284 -- 1285, 1285 -- 1286. All
I can say is that it\'s a good thing the majority isn\'t in the magazine
business. Of course you would care! You would be drawn aesthetically to
one, or instead to the other. You would want to convey the message of
one, or instead of the other. The point here is not that one is better
and the other worse. The point is that they are fundamentally different.
You would see them not as "substitute\[s\]," but as divergent ways to
(in the majority\'s mantra) "illustrate a magazine about Prince with a
portrait of Prince." *Ante*, at 1274 -- 1275, 1284; see *ante*, at 1278
-- 1279, and n. 11, 1281, n. 15, 1285 -- 1286. Or else you (like the
majority) would not have much of a future in magazine publishing.

 

In any event, the editors of Vanity Fair and Condé Nast understood the
difference---the gulf in both aesthetics and meaning---between the
Goldsmith photo and the Warhol portrait. They knew about the photo; but
they wanted the portrait. They saw that as between the two works, Warhol
had effected a transformation.

 

B

The question in this case is whether that transformation should matter
in assessing whether Warhol made "fair use" of Goldsmith\'s copyrighted
photo. The answer is yes---it should push toward (although not dictate)
a finding of fair use. That answer comports with the copyright statute,
its underlying policy, and our precedent concerning the two. Under
established copyright law (until today), Warhol\'s addition of important
"new expression, meaning, \[and\] message" counts in his favor in the
fair-use inquiry. [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

Start by asking a broader question: Why do we have "fair use" anyway?
The majority responds that while copyrights encourage the making of
creative works, fair use promotes **\*568** their "public availability."
*Ante*, at 1273 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that description
sells fair use far short. Beyond promoting "availability," fair use
itself advances creativity and artistic progress. See [*Campbell*, 510
U.S. at 575, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (fair use is "necessary to fulfill
copyright\'s very purpose"---to "promote science and the arts"). That is
because creative work does not happen in a vacuum. "Nothing comes from
nothing, nothing ever could," said songwriter Richard Rodgers, maybe
thinking not only about love and marriage but also about how the Great
American Songbook arose from vaudeville, ragtime, the blues, and
jazz.[]{#co_fnRef_B00272074754246_ID0EXRHK_1
.anchor}[^4^](#co_footnote_B00272074754246_1) This Court has long
understood the point---has gotten how new art, new invention, and new
knowledge arise from existing works. Our seminal opinion on fair use
quoted the illustrious Justice Story:

> "In truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can
> be, few, if any, **\*\*1298** things, which \... are strictly new and
> original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art,
> borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well
> known and used before." [*Id.*, at 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (quoting
> [*Emerson v. Davies*, 8 F.Cas. 615, 619 (No. 4,436) (C.C.D. Mass.
> 1845)]()).

Because that is so, a copyright regime with no escape valves would
"stifle the very creativity which \[the\] law is designed to foster."
[*Stewart*, 495 U.S. at 236, 110 S.Ct. 1750](). Fair use is such an
escape valve. It "allow\[s\] others to build upon" copyrighted **\*569**
material, so as not to "put manacles upon" creative progress.
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (internal quotation
marks omitted). In short, copyright\'s core value---promoting
creativity---sometimes demands a pass for copying.

 

To identify when that is so, the courts developed and Congress later
codified a multi-factored inquiry. As the majority describes, see
*ante*, at 1273 -- 1274, the current statute sets out four non-exclusive
considerations to guide courts. They are: (1) "the purpose and character
of the use" made of the copyrighted work, "including whether such use is
of a commercial nature"; (2) "the nature of the copyrighted work"; (3)
"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole"; and (4) "the effect of the use upon the
potential market for or value of the copyrighted work." [17 U.S.C. §
107](). Those factors sometimes point in different directions; if so, a
court must weigh them against each other. In doing so, we have stated,
courts should view the fourth factor---which focuses on the copyright
holder\'s economic interests---as the "most important." See [*Harper &
Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises*, 471 U.S. 539, 566, 105
S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588
(1985)]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00282074754246_ID0EJ3HK_1
.anchor}[^5^](#co_footnote_B00282074754246_1) But the overall balance
cannot come **\*570** out right unless each factor is assessed
correctly. This case, of course, is about (and only about) the first.

 

And that factor is distinctive: It is the only one that focuses on what
the copier\'s use of the original work accomplishes. The first factor
asks about the "character" of that use---its "main or essential
nature\[,\] esp\[ecially\] as strongly marked and serving **\*\*1299**
to distinguish." Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 376
(1976). And the first factor asks about the "purpose" of the use---the
"object, effect, or result aimed at, intended, or attained." *Id.*, at
1847. In that way, the first factor gives the copier a chance to make
his case. See P. Leval, [Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L. Rev.
1105, 1116 (1990)]() (describing factor 1 as "the soul of" the "fair use
defense"). Look, the copier can say, at how I altered the original, and
what I achieved in so doing. Look at how (as Judge Leval\'s seminal
article put the point) the original was "used as raw material" and was
"transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new
insights." [*Id.*, at 1111](). That is hardly the end of the fair-use
inquiry (commercialism, too, may bear on the first factor, and anyway
there are three factors to go), but it matters profoundly. Because when
a transformation of the original work has occurred, the user of the work
has made the kind of creative contribution that copyright law has as its
object.

 

Don\'t take it from me (or Judge Leval): The above is exactly what this
Court has held about how to apply factor 1. **\*571** In [*Campbell*](),
our primary case on the topic, we stated that the first factor\'s
purpose-and-character test "central\[ly\]" concerns "whether and to what
extent the new work is 'transformative.' " [510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164 (quoting Leval 1111)](). That makes sense, we explained, because
"the goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally
furthered by the creation of transformative works." [510 U.S. at 579,
114 S.Ct. 1164](). We then expounded on when such a transformation
happens. Harking back to Justice Story, we explained that a "new work"
might "merely 'supersede\[ \] the objects' of the original
creation"---meaning, that it does no more, and for no other end, than
the first work had. [*Ibid.*]() (quoting [*Folsom v. Marsh*, 9 F.Cas.
342, 348 (No. 4,901) (C.C.D. Mass. 1841)]()). But alternatively, the new
work could "add\[ \] something new, with a further purpose or different
character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message."
[510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Forgive me, but given the
majority\'s stance (see, *e.g.*, *ante*, at 1284 -- 1285), that bears
repeating: The critical factor 1 inquiry, we held, is whether a new work
alters the first with "new expression, meaning, or message." The more it
does so, the more transformative the new work. And (here is the final
takeaway) "the more transformative the new work, the less will be the
significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh
against a finding of fair use." [510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().
Under that approach, the [*Campbell*]() Court held, the rap group 2 Live
Crew\'s "transformative" copying of Roy Orbison\'s "Pretty Woman"
counted in favor of fair use. [*Id.*, at 583, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). And
that was so even though the rap song was, as everyone agreed, recorded
and later sold for profit. See [*id.*, at 573, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

Just two Terms ago, in [*Google*](), we made all the same points. We
quoted [*Campbell*]() in explaining that the factor 1 inquiry is
"whether the copier\'s use 'adds something new, with a further purpose
or different character, altering' the copyrighted work 'with new
expression, meaning, or message.' " [593 U. S., at --------, 141 S.Ct.
at 1219](). We again described "a copying **\*572** use that adds
something new and important" as "transformative." [*Ibid.*]() We
reiterated that protecting transformative uses "stimulate\[s\]
creativity" and thus "fulfill\[s\] the objective of copyright law."
[*Ibid.*]() (quoting Leval 1111). And then we gave an example. Yes, of
course, we pointed to Andy Warhol. (The majority claims not to be
embarrassed by this embarrassing fact because the specific reference was
to his Soup Cans, rather than his celebrity images. **\*\*1300** But
drawing a distinction between a "commentary on consumerism"---which is
how the majority describes his soup canvases, *ante*, at 1281---and a
commentary on celebrity culture, *i.e.*, the turning of people into
consumption items, is slicing the baloney pretty thin.) Finally, the
Court conducted the first-factor inquiry it had described. Google had
replicated Sun Microsystems' computer code as part of a "commercial
endeavor," done "for commercial profit." [593 U. S., at --------, 141
S.Ct. at 1204](). No matter, said the Court. "\[M\]any common fair uses
are indisputably commercial." [*Ibid.*]() What mattered instead was that
Google had used Sun\'s code to make "something new and important": a
"highly creative and innovative" software platform. [*Id.*, at --------
-- --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203](). The use of the code, the Court
held, was therefore "transformative" and "point\[ed\] toward fair use."
[*Id.*, at --------, --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1203, 1204-1205]().

 

[*Campbell*]() and [*Google*]() also illustrate the difference it can
make in the world to protect transformative works through fair use. Easy
enough to say (as the majority does, see *ante*, at 1296) that a
follow-on creator should just pay a licensing fee for its use of an
original work. But sometimes copyright holders charge an out-of-range
price for licenses. And other times they just say no. In [*Campbell*](),
for example, Orbison\'s successor-in-interest turned down 2 Live Crew\'s
request for a license, hoping to block the rap take-off of the original
song. See [510 U.S. at 572--573, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). And in [*Google*](),
the parties could not agree on licensing terms, as Sun insisted on
conditions that Google thought would have subverted its business
**\*573** model. See [593 U. S., at --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1190-1191]().
So without fair use, 2 Live Crew\'s and Google\'s works---however new
and important---might never have been made or, if made, never have
reached the public. The prospect of that loss to "creative progress" is
what lay behind the Court\'s inquiry into transformativeness---into the
expressive novelty of the follow-on work (regardless whether the
original creator granted permission). [*Id.*, at --------, 141 S.Ct. at
1203](); see [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

Now recall all the ways Warhol, in making a Prince portrait from the
Goldsmith photo, "add\[ed\] something new, with a further purpose or
different character"---all the ways he "alter\[ed\] the \[original
work\'s\] expression, meaning, \[and\] message." [*Ibid.*]() The
differences in form and appearance, relating to "composition,
presentation, color palette, and media." 1 App. 227; see *supra*, at
1294 -- 1297. The differences in meaning that arose from replacing a
realistic---and indeed humanistic---depiction of the performer with an
unnatural, disembodied, masklike one. See *ibid.* The conveyance of new
messages about celebrity culture and its personal and societal impacts.
See *ibid.* The presence of, in a word, "transformation"---the kind of
creative building that copyright exists to encourage. Warhol\'s use, to
be sure, had a commercial aspect. Like most artists, Warhol did not want
to hide his works in a garret; he wanted to sell them. But as
[*Campbell*]() and [*Google*]() both demonstrate (and as further
discussed below), that fact is nothing near the showstopper the majority
claims. Remember, the more transformative the work, the less
commercialism matters. See [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164](); *supra*, at 1299; *ante*, at 1276 (acknowledging the point,
even while refusing to give it any meaning). The dazzling creativity
evident in the Prince portrait might not get Warhol all the way home in
the fair-use inquiry; there remain other factors to be considered and
possibly weighed against the first one. See *supra*, at 1292, 1296 --
1297, 1299. But the "purpose and character of \[Warhol\'s\] use" of the
copyrighted **\*574** **\*\*1301** work---what he did to the Goldsmith
photo, in service of what objects---counts powerfully in his favor. He
started with an old photo, but he created a new new
thing.[]{#co_fnRef_B00292074754246_ID0EDIBM_1

II

The majority does not see it. And I mean that literally. There is
precious little evidence in today\'s opinion that the majority has
actually looked at these images, much less that it has engaged with
expert views of their aesthetics and meaning. Whatever new expression
Warhol added, the majority says, was not transformative. See *ante*, at
1280. Apparently, Warhol made only "modest alterations." *Ante*, at
1285. Anyone, the majority suggests, could have "crop\[ped\],
flatten\[ed\], trace\[d\], and color\[ed\] the photo" as Warhol did.
*Ante*, at 1270. True, Warhol portrayed Prince "somewhat differently."
*Ante*, at 1284. But the "degree of difference" is too small: It
consists merely in applying Warhol\'s "characteristic style"---an
aesthetic gloss, if you will---"to bring out a particular meaning" that
was already "available in \[Goldsmith\'s\] photograph." *Ibid.* So too,
Warhol\'s commentary on celebrity culture matters not at all; the
majority is not willing to concede that it even exists. See *ante*, at
1285 ("even if such commentary is perceptible"). And as for the District
Court\'s view that Warhol transformed Prince from a "vulnerable,
uncomfortable person to an iconic, larger-than-life figure," the
majority is downright dismissive. *Ante*, at 1284. Vulnerable,
iconic---who cares? The silkscreen and the photo, the majority claims,
still have the same "essential nature." *Ante*, at 1280, n. 14 (emphasis
deleted).

 

The description is disheartening. It\'s as though Warhol is an Instagram
filter, and a simple one at that (*e.g.*, sepia-tinting). **\*575**
"What is all the fuss about?," the majority wants to know. Ignoring
reams of expert evidence---explaining, as every art historian could
explain, exactly what the fuss is about---the majority plants itself
firmly in the "I could paint that" school of art criticism. No wonder
the majority sees the two images as essentially fungible products in the
magazine market---publish this one, publish that one, what does it
matter? See *ante*, at 1278 -- 1279; *supra*, at 1296 -- 1297. The
problem is that it *does* matter, for all the reasons given in the
record and discussed above. See *supra*, at 1296 -- 1297. Warhol based
his silkscreen on a photo, but fundamentally changed its character and
meaning. In belittling those creative contributions, the majority
guarantees that it will reach the wrong result.

 

Worse still, the majority maintains that those contributions, even if
significant, just would not matter. All of Warhol\'s artistry and social
commentary is negated by one thing: Warhol licensed his portrait to a
magazine, and Goldsmith sometimes licensed her photos to magazines too.
That is the sum and substance of the majority opinion. Over and over,
the majority incants that "\[b\]oth \[works\] are portraits of Prince
used in magazines to illustrate stories about Prince"; they therefore
both "share substantially the same purpose"---meaning, a commercial one.
*Ante*, at 1278, 1287; see *ante*, at 1272 -- 1273, 1281, n. 15, 1284 --
1285, 1285 -- 1286. Or said otherwise, because Warhol entered into a
licensing transaction with Condé Nast, he could not get any help from
factor 1---regardless how transformative his image was. See, *e.g.*,
*ante*, at 1285 -- 1286 (Warhol\'s licensing "outweigh\[s\]" any "new
meaning or message" he could have offered). The majority\'s **\*\*1302**
commercialism-trumps-creativity analysis has only one way out. If Warhol
had used Goldsmith\'s photo to comment on or critique *Goldsmith\'s
photo*, he might have availed himself of that factor\'s benefit (though
why anyone would be interested in that work is mysterious). See *ante*,
at 1285. But because he **\*576** instead commented on *society*---the
dehumanizing culture of celebrity---he is (go figure) out of luck.

 

From top-to-bottom, the analysis fails. It does not fit the copyright
statute. It is not faithful to our precedent. And it does not serve the
purpose both Congress and the Court have understood to lie at the core
of fair use: "stimulat\[ing\] creativity," by enabling artists and
writers of every description to build on prior works. [*Google*, 593 U.
S., at --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203](). That is how art, literature,
and music happen; it is also how all forms of knowledge advance. Even as
the majority misconstrues the law, it misunderstands---and
threatens---the creative process.

 

Start with what the statute tells us about whether the factor 1 inquiry
should disregard Warhol\'s creative contributions because he licensed
his work. (Sneak preview: It shouldn\'t.) The majority claims the text
as its strong suit, viewing our precedents' inquiry into new expression
and meaning as a faulty "paraphrase" of the statutory language. *Ante*,
at 1281 -- 1283. But it is the majority, not [*Campbell*]() and
[*Google*](), that misreads [§ 107(1)](). First, the key term
"character" plays little role in the majority\'s analysis. See *ante*,
at 1272 -- 1273, 1278 -- 1279, and n. 11, 1282 -- 1283 (statements of
central test or holding referring only to "purpose"). And you can see
why, given the counter-intuitive meaning the majority (every so often)
provides. See *ante*, at 1279 -- 1280, and n. 14. When referring to the
"character" of what Warhol did, the majority says merely that he
"licensed Orange Prince to Condé Nast for \$10,000." See *ante*, at 1279
-- 1280. But that reductionist view rids the term of most of its
ordinary meaning. "Character" typically refers to a thing\'s "main or
essential nature\[,\] esp\[ecially\] as strongly marked and serving to
distinguish." Webster\'s Third 376; see *supra*, at 1298 -- 1299. The
essential and distinctive nature of an artist\'s use of a work commonly
nvolves artistry---as it did here. See also [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at
582, 588--589, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (discussing the expressive "character"
**\*577** of 2 Live Crew\'s rap). So the term "character" makes
significant everything the record contains---and everything everyone
(save the majority) knows---about the differences in expression and
meaning between Goldsmith\'s photo and Warhol\'s silkscreen.

 

Second, the majority significantly narrows [§ 107(1)]()'s reference to
"purpose" (thereby paralleling its constriction of "character"). It
might be obvious to you that artists have artistic purposes. And surely
it was obvious to the drafters of a law aiming to promote artistic (and
other kinds of ) creativity. But not to the majority, which again cares
only about Warhol\'s decision to license his art. Warhol\'s purpose, the
majority says, was just to "depict Prince in \[a\] magazine stor\[y\]
about Prince" in exchange for money. *Ante*, at 1273. The majority
spurns all that mattered to the artist---evident on the face of his
work---about "expression, meaning, \[and\] message." [*Campbell*, 510
U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](); [*Google*, 593 U. S., at --------, 141
S.Ct. at 1202-1203](). That indifference to purposes beyond the
commercial---for what an artist, most fundamentally, wants to
communicate---finds no support in [§
107(1)]().[]{#co_fnRef_B00302074754246_ID0E56BM_1
.anchor}[^7^](#co_footnote_B00302074754246_1)

 

**\*578** **\*\*1303** Still more, the majority\'s
commercialism-über-alles view of the factor 1 inquiry fits badly with
two other parts of the fair-use provision. To begin, take the preamble,
which gives examples of uses often thought fair: "criticism, comment,
news reporting, teaching\[,\] \... scholarship, or research." [§ 107]().
As we have explained, an emphasis on commercialism would "swallow" those
uses---that is, would mostly *deprive* them of fair-use protection.
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 584, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). For the listed
"activities are generally conducted for profit in this country."
[*Ibid.*]() (internal quotation marks omitted). "No man but a
blockhead," Samuel Johnson once noted, "ever wrote\[ \] except for
money." 3 Boswell\'s Life of Johnson 19 (G. Hill ed. 1934). And Congress
of course knew that when it drafted the preamble.

 

Next, skip to the last factor in the fair-use test: "the effect of the
use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work." [§
107(4)](). You might think that when Congress lists two different
factors for consideration, it is because the two factors are, well,
different. But the majority transplants factor 4 into factor 1. Recall
that the majority conducts a kind of market analysis: Warhol, the
majority says, licensed his portrait of Prince to a magazine that
Goldsmith could have licensed her photo to---and so may have caused her
economic harm. See *ante*, at 1278 -- 1279; see also *ante*, at 1276 --
1277 (focusing on whether a follow-on work is a market "substitute" for
the original); *ante*, at 1290 (GORSUCH, J., concurring) (describing the
"salient point" as whether Warhol\'s "use involved competition with Ms.
Goldsmith\'s image"). That issue is no doubt important in the fair-use
inquiry. But it is the stuff of factor 4: how Warhol\'s use affected the
"value of" or "market for" Goldsmith\'s photo. Factor 1 focuses on the
other side of the equation: the new expression, meaning, or message that
may come from someone else using the original. Under the statute,
**\*579** courts are supposed to strike a balance between the two---and
thus between rewarding original creators and enabling others to build on
their works. That cannot happen when a court, à la the majority,
double-counts the first goal and ignores the second.

 

Is it possible I overstate the matter? I would like for that to be true.
And a puzzling aspect of today\'s opinion is that it occasionally
acknowledges the balance that the fair-use provision contemplates. So,
for example, the majority notes after reviewing the relevant text that
"the central question \[the first factor\] asks" is whether the new work
"adds something new" to the copyrighted one. *Ante*, at 1274 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Yes, exactly. And in other places, the
majority suggests that a court should consider in the factor 1 analysis
not merely the commercial context but also the copier\'s addition of
"new expression," including new meaning or message. *Ante*, at 1272 --
1273; see **\*\*1304** *ante*, at 1276, 1280, n.13, 1280, 1284. In that
way, the majority opinion differs from Justice GORSUCH\'s concurrence,
which would exclude all inquiry into whether a follow-on work is
transformative. See *ante*, at 1289, 1290. And it is possible lower
courts will pick up on that difference, and ensure that the "newness" of
a follow-on work will continue to play a significant role in the factor
1 analysis. If so, I\'ll be happy to discover that my "claims \[have\]
not age\[d\] well." *Ante*, at 1286. But that would require courts to do
what the majority does not: make a serious inquiry into the follow-on
artist\'s creative contributions. The majority\'s refusal to do so is
what creates the oddity at the heart of today\'s opinion. If "newness"
matters (as the opinion sometimes says), then why does the majority
dismiss all the newness Warhol added just because he licensed his
portrait to Condé Nast? And why does the majority insist more generally
that in a commercial context "convey\[ing\] a new meaning or message" is
"not enough for the first factor to favor fair use"? *Ante*, at 1285 --
1286.

 

**\*580** Certainly not because of our precedent---which conflicts with
nearly all the majority says. As explained earlier, this Court has
decided two important cases about factor 1. See *supra*, at 1299 --
1300. In each, the copier had built on the original to make a product
for sale---so the use was patently commercial. And in each, that fact
made no difference, because the use was also transformative. The copier,
we held, had made a significant creative contribution---had added real
value. So in [*Campbell*](), we did not ask whether 2 Live Crew and Roy
Orbison both meant to make money by "including a catchy song about women
on a record album." But cf. *ante*, at 1273 (asking whether Warhol and
Goldsmith both meant to charge for "depict\[ing\] Prince in magazine
stories about Prince"). We instead asked whether 2 Live Crew had added
significant "new expression, meaning, \[and\] message"; and because we
answered yes, we held that the group\'s rap song did not "merely
supersede the objects of the original creation." [510 U.S. at 579, 114
S.Ct. 1164]() (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).
Similarly, in [*Google*](), we took for granted that Google (the copier)
and Sun (the original author) both meant to market software platforms
facilitating the same tasks---just as (in the majority\'s refrain)
Warhol and Goldsmith both wanted to market images depicting the same
subject. See [593 U. S., at --------, --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1203,
1204](). "So what?" was our basic response. Google\'s copying had
enabled the company to make a "highly creative and innovative tool,"
advancing "creative progress" and thus serving "the basic constitutional
objective of copyright." [*Id.*, at --------, 141 S.Ct. at 1203]()
(internal quotation marks omitted). Search today\'s opinion high and
low, you will see no such awareness of how copying can help produce
valuable new works.

 

Nor does our precedent support the majority\'s strong distinction
between follow-on works that "target" the original and those that do
not. *Ante*, at 1285 -- 1286. (Even the majority does not claim that
anything in the text does so.) True **\*581** enough that the rap song
in [*Campbell*]() fell into the former category: 2 Live Crew urged that
its work was a parody of Orbison\'s song. But even in discussing the
value of parody, [*Campbell*]() made clear the limits of targeting\'s
importance. The Court observed that as the "extent of transformation"
increases, the relevance of targeting decreases. [510 U.S. at 581, n.
14, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). [*Google*]() proves the point. The new work there
did not parody, comment on, or otherwise direct itself to the old: The
former just made use of the latter for its own devices. Yet that fact
never made an appearance in the Court\'s opinion; what mattered instead
was the "highly creative" use **\*\*1305** Google had made of the copied
code. That decision is on point here. Would Warhol\'s work really have
been more worthy of protection if it had (somehow) "she\[d\] light" on
Goldsmith\'s photograph, rather than on Prince, his celebrity status,
and celebrity culture? *Ante*, at 1281. Would that Goldsmith-focused
work (whatever it might be) have more meaningfully advanced creative
progress, which is copyright\'s raison d'être, than the work he actually
made? I can\'t see how; more like the opposite. The majority\'s
preference for the directed work, apparently on grounds of necessity,
see *ante*, at 1281, 1285 -- 1286, again reflects its undervaluing of
transformative copying as a core part of artistry.

 

And there\'s the rub. (Yes, that\'s mostly Shakespeare.) As Congress
knew, and as this Court once saw, new creations come from building
on---and, in the process, transforming---those coming before. Today\'s
decision stymies and suppresses that process, in art and every other
kind of creative endeavor. The decision enhances a copyright holder\'s
power to inhibit artistic development, by enabling her to block even the
use of a work to fashion something quite different. Or viewed the other
way round, the decision impedes non-copyright holders' artistic
pursuits, by preventing them from making even the most novel uses of
existing materials. **\*582** On either account, the public loses: The
decision operates to constrain creative
expression.[]{#co_fnRef_B00312074754246_ID0E31CM_1
.anchor}[^8^](#co_footnote_B00312074754246_1)

 

The effect, moreover, will be dramatic. Return again to Justice Story,
see *supra*, at 1297 -- 1298: "\[I\]n literature, in science and in art,
there are, and can be, few, if any, things" that are "new and original
throughout." [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (quoting
[*Emerson*, 8 F.Cas. at 619]()). Every work "borrows, and must
necessarily" do so. [510 U.S. at 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Creators
themselves know that fact deep in their bones. Here is Mark Twain on the
subject: "The kern\[e\]l, the soul---let us go further and say the
substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material" of creative
works---all are "consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million
outside sources." Letter from M. Twain to H. Keller, in 2 Mark Twain\'s
Letters 731 (1917); see also *id.*, at 732 (quoting Oliver Wendell
Holmes---no, not that one, his father the poet---as saying "I have never
originated anything altogether myself, nor met anybody who had").
"\[A\]ppropriation, mimicry, quotation, allusion and sublimated
collaboration," novelist Jonathan Lethem has explained, are "a kind of
sine qua non of the creative act, cutting across all forms and genres in
the realm of cultural production." The Ecstasy of Influence, in
Harper\'s Magazine 61 (Feb. 2007). Or as Mary Shelley once wrote, there
is no **\*583** such thing as "creating out of \[a\] void." Frankenstein
ix (1831).[]{#co_fnRef_B00322074754246_ID0EJDDM_1
.anchor}[^9^](#co_footnote_B00322074754246_1)

 

**\*\*1306** Consider, in light of those authorial references, how the
majority\'s factor 1 analysis might play out in literature. And why not
start with the best? Shakespeare borrowed over and over and over. See,
*e.g.*, 8 Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare 351--352 (G.
Bullough ed. 1975) ("Shakespeare was an adapter of other men\'s tales
and plays; he liked to build a new construction on something given"). I
could point to a whole slew of works, but let\'s take Romeo and Juliet
as an example. Shakespeare\'s version copied most directly from Arthur
Brooke\'s The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, written a few
decades earlier (though of course Brooke copied from someone, and that
person copied from someone, and that person \... going back *at least*
to Ovid\'s story about Pyramus and Thisbe). Shakespeare took plot,
characters, themes, even passages: The friar\'s line to Romeo, "Art thou
a man? Thy form cries out thou art," appeared in Brooke as "Art thou a
man? The shape saith so thou art." Bullough 387. (Shakespeare was, among
other things, a good editor.) Of course Shakespeare also added loads of
genius, and so made the borrowed stories "uniquely Shakespearian." G.
Williams, Shakespeare\'s Basic Plot Situation, 2 Shakespeare Quarterly
No. 4, p. 313 (Oct. 1951). But on the majority\'s analysis? The two
works---Shakespeare\'s and Brooke\'s---are just two stories of
star-crossed lovers written for commercial gain. Shakespeare would not
**\*584** qualify for fair use; he would not even come out ahead on
factor 1.

 

And if you think that\'s just Shakespeare, here are a couple more. (Once
you start looking, examples are everywhere.) Lolita, though hard to read
today, is usually thought one of the greatest novels of the 20th
century. But the plotline---an adult man takes a room as a lodger;
embarks on an obsessive sexual relationship with the preteen daughter of
the house; and eventually survives her death, remaining marked
forever---appears in a story by Heinz von Lichberg written a few decades
earlier. Oh, and the girl\'s name is Lolita in both versions. See
generally M. Maar, The Two Lolitas (2005). All that said, the two works
have little in common artistically; nothing literary critics admire in
the second Lolita is found in the first. But to the majority? Just two
stories of revoltingly lecherous men, published for profit. So even
factor 1 of the fair-use inquiry would not aid Nabokov. Or take one of
the most famed adventure stories ever told. Here is the provenance of
Treasure Island, as Robert Louis Stevenson himself described it:

> "No doubt the parrot once belonged to Robinson Crusoe. No doubt the
> skeleton is conveyed from \[Edgar Allan\] Poe. I think little of
> these, they are trifles and details; and no man can hope to have a
> monopoly of skeletons or make a corner in talking birds\.... It is my
> debt to Washington Irving that exercises my conscience, and justly so,
> for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther\.... Billy Bones,
> his chest, the company in the parlor, the whole inner spirit and a
> good deal of the material detail of my first chapters---all were
> there, all were the property of Washington Irving." My First
> Book---*Treasure Island*, in 21 Syracuse University Library Associates
> Courier No. 2, p. 84 (1986).

Odd that a book about pirates should have practiced piracy? Not really,
because tons of books do---and not many **\*585** in order to "target"
or otherwise comment on the originals. "Thomas Mann, himself a master of
\[the art,\] called \[it\] 'higher cribbing.' " Lethem 59. The point
here is that most writers worth their salt steal other writers'
moves---and put them to other, often better uses. But the majority would
say, again and yet again in the face of such transformative **\*\*1307**
copying, "no factor 1 help and surely no fair use."

 

Or how about music? Positively rife with copying of all kinds. Suppose
some early blues artist (W. C. Handy, perhaps?) had copyrighted the
12-bar, three-chord form---the essential foundation (much as
Goldsmith\'s photo is to Warhol\'s silkscreen) of many blues songs.
Under the majority\'s view, Handy could then have controlled---meaning,
curtailed---the development of the genre. And also of a fair bit of rock
and roll. "Just another rendition of 12-bar blues for sale in record
stores," the majority would say to Chuck Berry (Johnny B. Goode), Bill
Haley (Rock Around the Clock), Jimi Hendrix (Red House), or Eric Clapton
(Crossroads). Or to switch genres, imagine a pioneering classical
composer (Haydn?) had copyrighted the three-section sonata form. "One
more piece built on the same old structure, for use in concert halls,"
the majority might say to Mozart and Beethoven and countless others:
"Sure, some new notes, but the backbone of your compositions is
identical."

 

And then, there\'s the appropriation of those notes, and accompanying
words, for use in new and different ways. Stravinsky reportedly said
that great composers do not imitate, but instead steal. See P. Yates,
Twentieth Century Music 41 (1967). At any rate, he would have known. He
took music from all over---from Russian folk melodies to
Schoenberg---and made it inimitably his own. And then---as these things
go---his music became a source for others. Charlie Parker turned The
Rite of Spring into something of a jazz standard: You can still hear the
Stravinsky lurking, but jazz musicians make the composition a thing of a
different kind. And popular music? I won\'t point fingers, but **\*586**
maybe rock\'s only Nobel Laureate and greatest-ever lyricist is known
for some appropriations? See M. Gilmore, The Rolling Stone Interview,
Rolling Stone, Sept. 27, 2012, pp. 51,
81.[]{#co_fnRef_B00332074754246_ID0EBPDM_1
.anchor}[^10^](#co_footnote_B00332074754246_1) He wouldn\'t be alone.
Here\'s what songwriter Nick Cave (he of the Bad Seeds) once said about
how music develops:

> "The great beauty of contemporary music, and what gives it its edge
> and vitality, is its devil-may-care attitude toward
> appropriation---everybody is grabbing stuff from everybody else, *all
> the time*. It\'s a feeding frenzy of borrowed ideas that goes toward
> the advancement of rock music---the great artistic experiment of our
> era." The Red Hand Files (Apr. 2020) (online source archived at
> https://www.supremecourt.gov).

But not as the majority sees the matter. Are these guys making money?
Are they appropriating for some different reason than to critique the
thing being borrowed? Then they\'re "shar\[ing\] the objectives" of the
original work, and will get no benefit **\*\*1308** from factor 1, let
alone protection from the whole fair-use test. *Ante*, at 1279 -- 1280.

 

**\*587** Finally, back to the visual arts, for while Warhol may have
been the master appropriator within that field, he had plenty of
company; indeed, he worked within an established tradition going back
centuries (millennia?). The representatives of three giants of modern
art (you may know one for his use of comics) describe the tradition as
follows: "\[T\]he use and reuse of existing imagery" are "part of art\'s
lifeblood"---"not just in workaday practice or fledgling student
efforts, but also in the revolutionary moments of art history." Brief
for Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, and Joan Mitchell Foundations
et al. as *Amici Curiae* 6.

 

Consider as one example the reclining nude. Probably the first such
figure in Renaissance art was Giorgione\'s Sleeping Venus. (Note,
though, in keeping with the "nothing comes from nothing" theme, that
Giorgione apparently modeled his canvas on a woodcut illustration by
Francesco Colonna.) Here is Giorgione\'s painting:

 

[​]()

Giorgione, Sleeping Venus, c. 1510, oil on canvas

 

But things were destined not to end there. One of Giorgione\'s pupils
was Titian, and the former student undertook to riff on his master. The
resulting Venus of Urbino is a **\*588** prototypical example of
Renaissance *imitatio*---the creation of an original work from an
existing model. See *id.*, at 8; 1 G. Vasari, Lives of the Artists 31,
444 (G. Bull transl. 1965). You can see the resemblance---but also the
difference:

**\*\*1309**

[​]()

Titian, Venus of Urbino, 1538, oil on canvas

 

The majority would presumably describe these Renaissance canvases as
just "two portraits of reclining nudes painted to sell to patrons." Cf.
*ante*, at 1272 -- 1273, 1278 -- 1279. But wouldn\'t that miss
something---indeed, everything---about how an artist engaged with a
prior work to create new expression and add new value?

And the reuse of past images was far from done. For here is Édouard
Manet\'s Olympia, now considered a foundational work of artistic
modernism, but referring in obvious ways to Titian\'s (and back a step,
to Giorgione\'s) Venus:

 

**\*589**

[​]()

Manet, Olympia, 1863, oil on canvas

 

Here again consider the account of the Rauschenberg, Lichtenstein, and
Mitchell **\*\*1310** Foundations: "The revolutionary shock of the
painting depends on how traditional imagery remains the painting\'s
recognizable foundation, even as that imagery is transformed and
wrenched into the present." Brief as *Amici Curiae* 9. It is an
especially striking example of a recurrent phenomenon---of how the
development of visual art works across time and place, constantly
building on what came earlier. In fact, the Manet has itself spawned
further transformative paintings, from Cézanne to a raft of contemporary
artists across the globe. See *id.*, at 10--11. But the majority, as to
these matters, is uninterested and unconcerned.

Take a look at one last example, from a modern master very different
from Warhol, but availing himself of the same **\*590** appropriative
traditions. On the left (below) is Velázquez\'s portrait of Pope
Innocent X; on the right is Francis Bacon\'s Study After Velázquez\'s
Portrait.

 

[​]()

To begin with, note the word "after" in Bacon\'s title. Copying is so
deeply rooted in the visual arts that there is a naming convention for
it, with "after" denoting that a painting is some kind of "imitation of
a known work." M. Clarke, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms 5
(2d ed. 2010). Bacon made frequent use of that convention. He was
especially taken by Velázquez\'s portrait of Innocent X, referring to it
in tens of paintings. In the one shown above, Bacon retained the
subject, scale, and composition of the Velázquez original. Look at one,
look at the other, and you know Bacon copied. But he also transformed.
He invested his portrait with new "expression, meaning, \[and\]
message," converting Velázquez\'s study of magisterial power into one of
mortal dread. [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

**\*591** But the majority, from all it says, would find the change
immaterial. Both paintings, after all, are "portraits of \[Pope Innocent
X\] used to depict \[Pope Innocent X\]" for hanging in some interior
space, *ante*, at 1273; so on the majority\'s reasoning, someone in the
market for a papal portrait could use either one, see *ante*, at 1278 --
1279. Velázquez\'s portrait, although Bacon\'s model, is not "the object
of \[his\] commentary." *Ante*, at 1281; see A. Zweite, **\*\*1311**
Bacon\'s Scream, in Francis Bacon: The Violence of the Real 71 (A.
Zweite ed. 2006) (Bacon "was not seeking to expose Velázquez\'s
masterpiece," but instead to "adapt it" and "give it a new meaning").
And absent that "target\[ing\]," the majority thinks the portraits'
distinct messages make no difference. *Ante*, at 1281. Recall how the
majority deems irrelevant the District Court\'s view that the Goldsmith
Prince is vulnerable, the Warhol Prince iconic. Too small a "degree of
difference," according to the majority. *Ante*, at 1284 -- 1285; see
*supra*, at 1300 -- 1301. So too here, presumably: the stolid Pope, the
disturbed Pope---it just doesn\'t matter. But that once again misses
what a copier accomplished: the making of a wholly new piece of art from
an existing one.

 

The majority thus treats creativity as a trifling part of the fair-use
inquiry, in disregard of settled copyright principles and what they
reflect about the artistic process. On the majority\'s view, an artist
had best not attempt to market even a transformative follow-on
work---one that adds significant new expression, meaning, or message.
That added value (unless it comes from critiquing the original) will no
longer receive credit under factor 1. And so it can never hope to
outweigh factor 4\'s assessment of the copyright holder\'s interests.
The result will be what this Court has often warned against: suppression
of "the very creativity which \[copyright\] law is designed to foster."
[*Stewart*, 495 U.S. at 236, 110 S.Ct. 1750](); see *supra*, at 1297 --
1298. And not just on the margins. Creative progress unfolds through use
and reuse, framing **\*592** and reframing: One work builds on what has
gone before; and later works build on that one; and so on through time.
Congress grasped the idea when it directed courts to attend to the
"purpose and character" of artistic borrowing---to what the borrower has
made out of existing materials. That inquiry recognizes the value in
using existing materials to fashion something new. And so too, this
Court---from Justice Story\'s time to two Terms ago---has known that it
is through such iterative processes that knowledge accumulates and art
flourishes. But not anymore. The majority\'s decision is no
"continuation" of "existing copyright law." *Ante*, at 1287. In
declining to acknowledge the importance of transformative copying, the
Court today, and for the first time, turns its back on how creativity
works.

 

III

And the workings of creativity bring us back to Andy Warhol. For Warhol,
as this Court noted in [*Google*](), is the very embodiment of
transformative copying. He is proof of concept---that an artist working
from a model can create important new expression. Or said more strongly,
that appropriations can help bring great art into being. Warhol is a
towering figure in modern art not despite but because of his use of
source materials. His work---whether Soup Cans and Brillo Boxes or
Marilyn and Prince---turned something not his into something all his
own. Except that it also became all of ours, because his work today
occupies a significant place not only in our museums but in our wider
artistic culture. And if the majority somehow cannot see it---well,
that\'s what evidentiary records are for. The one in this case contained
undisputed testimony, and lots of it, that Warhol\'s Prince series
conveyed a fundamentally different idea, in a fundamentally different
artistic style, than the photo he started from. That is not the end of
the fair-use inquiry. The test, recall, has four parts, with one
focusing squarely on Goldsmith\'s interests. But factor 1 is supposed to
measure **\*593** what Warhol has done. Did his "new work" "add\[ \]
something new, with a further purpose or different character"?
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). **\*\*1312** Did it
"alter\[ \] the first with new expression, meaning, or message"?
[*Ibid.*]() It did, and it did. In failing to give Warhol credit for
that transformation, the majority distorts ultimate resolution of the
fair-use question.

 

Still more troubling are the consequences of today\'s ruling for other
artists. If Warhol does not get credit for transformative copying, who
will? And when artists less famous than Warhol cannot benefit from fair
use, it will matter even more. Goldsmith would probably have granted
Warhol a license with few conditions, and for a price well within his
budget. But as our precedents show, licensors sometimes place stringent
limits on follow-on uses, especially to prevent kinds of expression they
disapprove. And licensors may charge fees that prevent many or most
artists from gaining access to original works. Of course, that is all
well and good if an artist wants merely to copy the original and market
it as his own. Preventing those uses---and thus incentivizing the
creation of original works---is what copyrights are for. But when the
artist wants to make a transformative use, a different issue is
presented. By now, the reason why should be obvious. "Inhibit\[ing\]
subsequent writers" and artists from "improv\[ing\] upon prior
works"---as the majority does today---will "frustrate the very ends
sought to be attained" by copyright law. [*Harper & Row*, 471 U.S. at
549, 105 S.Ct. 2218](). It will stifle creativity of every sort. It will
impede new art and music and literature. It will thwart the expression
of new ideas and the attainment of new knowledge. It will make our world
poorer.
