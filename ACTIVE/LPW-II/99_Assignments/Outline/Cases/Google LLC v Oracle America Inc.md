**Synopsis**

**Background:** Developer of software platform brought action alleging
that technology company, in creating software platform for smartphone
devices, infringed plaintiff\'s patents and copyrights for computer
programming language through unauthorized use of plaintiff\'s
application programming interface (API) packages, i.e., a portion of
platform that enabled a programmer to call up prewritten code that,
together with the computer\'s hardware, would carry out a large number
of specific tasks. After jury trial, the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California, [William Alsup](), J., [847
F.Supp.2d 1178](), entered judgment in favor of defendant on patent
claims, and entered judgment in favor of plaintiff in part and defendant
in part on copyright claims, concluding that the declaring code and the
structure, sequence, and organization (SSO) were a non-copyrightable
system or method of operation. Both parties appealed. The United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, O\'Malley, Circuit Judge, [750
F.3d 1339](), affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for trial
on fair use. The Supreme Court denied defendant\'s petition for a writ
of certiorari. After jury verdict for defendant on fair use, the
District Court, [Alsup](), J., [2016 WL 3181206](), denied plaintiff\'s
motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), and denied its renewed
motion for JMOL and for new trial, [2016 WL 5393938](). Plaintiff
appealed. The Court of Appeals, O\'Malley, Circuit Judge, [886 F.3d
1179](), reversed and remanded for trial on damages. Certiorari was
granted and supplemental briefing was ordered concerning standard of
review for a finding of fair use, including Seventh Amendment
implications, if any, on that standard.

 

**Holdings:** The Supreme Court, Justice [Breyer](), held that:

 

[^\[1\]^](#co_anchor_F72053376261_1) fair use question was mixed
question of fact and law, for purposes of standard for appellate review;

 

[^\[2\]^](#co_anchor_F92053376261_1) Seventh Amendment right of trial by
jury does not include fair use defense;

 

[^\[3\]^](#co_anchor_F102053376261_1) assuming copyrightability, nature
of copyrighted work was factor weighing in favor of finding fair use;

 

[^\[4\]^](#co_anchor_F112053376261_1) transformative purpose and
character of use constituted factor weighing in favor of finding fair
use;

 

[^\[5\]^](#co_anchor_F122053376261_1) amount and substantiality of
portion used constituted factor weighing in favor of finding fair use;
and

 

[^\[6\]^](#co_anchor_F132053376261_1) market effects constituted factor
weighing in favor of finding fair use.

 

Judgment of Court of Appeals reversed; remanded.

 

Justice [Thomas]() filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice
[Alito]() joined.

 

Justice [Barrett]() took no part in the consideration or decision of the
case.

 

**Procedural Posture(s):** Petition for Writ of Certiorari; On Appeal;
Judgment; Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL)/Directed
Verdict; Motion for New Trial.

**\*1** Oracle America, Inc., owns a copyright in Java SE, a computer
platform that uses the popular Java computer programming language. In
2005, Google acquired Android and sought to build a new software
platform for mobile devices. To allow the millions of programmers
familiar with the Java programming language to work with its new Android
platform, Google copied roughly 11,500 lines of code from the Java SE
program. The copied lines are part of a tool called an Application
Programming Interface (API). An API allows programmers to call upon
prewritten computing tasks for use in their own programs. Over the
course of protracted litigation, the lower courts have considered (1)
whether Java SE\'s owner could copyright the copied lines from the API,
and (2) if so, whether Google\'s copying constituted a permissible "fair
use" of that material freeing Google from copyright liability. In the
proceedings below, the Federal Circuit held that the copied lines are
copyrightable. After a jury then found for Google on fair use, the
Federal Circuit reversed, concluding that Google\'s copying was not a
fair use as a matter of law. Prior to remand for a trial on damages, the
Court agreed to review the Federal Circuit\'s determinations as to both
copyrightability and fair use.

 

*Held*: Google\'s copying of the Java SE API, which included only those
lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued
**\*2** talents to work in a new and transformative program, was a fair
use of that material as a matter of law. Pp. 1195 -- 1209.

 

\(a\) Copyright and patents, the Constitution says, serve to "promote
the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times
to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective
Writings and Discoveries." Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Copyright encourages the
production of works that others might cheaply reproduce by granting the
author an exclusive right to produce the work for a period of time.
Because such exclusivity may trigger negative consequences, Congress and
the courts have limited the scope of copyright protection to ensure that
a copyright holder\'s monopoly does not harm the public interest.

 

This case implicates two of the limits in the current Copyright Act.
First, the Act provides that copyright protection cannot extend to "any
idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept,
principle, or discovery \...." [17 U.S.C. § 102(b)](). Second, the Act
provides that a copyright holder may not prevent another person from
making a "fair use" of a copyrighted work. § 107. Google\'s petition
asks the Court to apply both provisions to the copying at issue here. To
decide no more than is necessary to resolve this case, the Court assumes
for argument\'s sake that the copied lines can be copyrighted, and
focuses on whether Google\'s use of those lines was a "fair use." Pp.
1195 -- 1198.

 

\(b\) The doctrine of "fair use" is flexible and takes account of
changes in technology. Computer programs differ to some extent from many
other copyrightable works because computer programs always serve a
functional purpose. Because of these differences, fair use has an
important role to play for computer programs by providing a
context-based check that keeps the copyright monopoly afforded to
computer programs within its lawful bounds. Pp. 1197 -- 1199.

 

\(c\) The fair use question is a mixed question of fact and law.
Reviewing courts should appropriately defer to the jury\'s findings of
underlying facts, but the ultimate question whether those facts amount
to a fair use is a legal question for judges to decide *de novo*. This
approach does not violate the Seventh Amendment\'s prohibition on courts
reexamining facts tried by a jury, because the ultimate question here is
one of law, not fact. The "right of trial by jury" does not include the
right to have a jury resolve a fair use defense. Pp. 1199 -- 1201.

 

\(d\) To determine whether Google\'s limited copying of the API here
constitutes fair use, the Court examines the four guiding factors set
forth in the Copyright Act\'s fair use provision: the purpose and
character of the use; the nature of the copyrighted work; the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as a whole; and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work. § 107. The Court has recognized that some
**\*3** factors may prove more important in some contexts than in
others. [*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 577, 114
S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500](). Pp. 1200 -- 1209.

 

\(1\) The nature of the work at issue favors fair use. The copied lines
of code are part of a "user interface" that provides a way for
programmers to access prewritten computer code through the use of simple
commands. As a result, this code is different from many other types of
code, such as the code that actually instructs the computer to execute a
task. As part of an interface, the copied lines are inherently bound
together with uncopyrightable ideas (the overall organization of the
API) and the creation of new creative expression (the code independently
written by Google). Unlike many other computer programs, the value of
the copied lines is in significant part derived from the investment of
users (here computer programmers) who have learned the API\'s system.
Given these differences, application of fair use here is unlikely to
undermine the general copyright protection that Congress provided for
computer programs. Pp. 1200 -- 1203.

 

\(2\) The inquiry into the "the purpose and character" of the use turns
in large measure on whether the copying at issue was "transformative,"
*i.e*., whether it "adds something new, with a further purpose or
different character." [*Campbell*, 510 U.S., at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().
Google\'s limited copying of the API is a transformative use. Google
copied only what was needed to allow programmers to work in a different
computing environment without discarding a portion of a familiar
programming language. Google\'s purpose was to create a different
task-related system for a different computing environment (smartphones)
and to create a platform---the Android platform---that would help
achieve and popularize that objective. The record demonstrates numerous
ways in which reimplementing an interface can further the development of
computer programs. Google\'s purpose was therefore consistent with that
creative progress that is the basic constitutional objective of
copyright itself. Pp. 1202 -- 1205.

 

\(3\) Google copied approximately 11,500 lines of declaring code from
the API, which amounts to virtually all the declaring code needed to
call up hundreds of different tasks. Those 11,500 lines, however, are
only 0.4 percent of the entire API at issue, which consists of 2.86
million total lines. In considering "the amount and substantiality of
the portion used" in this case, the 11,500 lines of code should be
viewed as one small part of the considerably greater whole. As part of
an interface, the copied lines of code are inextricably bound to other
lines of code that are accessed by programmers. Google copied these
lines not because of their creativity or beauty but because they would
allow programmers to bring their skills to a new smartphone computing
environment. The "substantiality" factor will generally weigh in favor
of **\*4** fair use where, as here, the amount of copying was tethered
to a valid, and transformative, purpose. Pp. 1204 -- 1206.

 

\(4\) The fourth statutory factor focuses upon the "effect" of the
copying in the "market for or value of the copyrighted work." § 107(4).
Here the record showed that Google\'s new smartphone platform is not a
market substitute for Java SE. The record also showed that Java SE\'s
copyright holder would benefit from the reimplementation of its
interface into a different market. Finally, enforcing the copyright on
these facts risks causing creativity-related harms to the public. When
taken together, these considerations demonstrate that the fourth
factor---market effects---also weighs in favor of fair use. Pp. 1205 --
1209.

 

\(e\) The fact that computer programs are primarily functional makes it
difficult to apply traditional copyright concepts in that technological
world. Applying the principles of the Court\'s precedents and Congress'
codification of the fair use doctrine to the distinct copyrighted work
here, the Court concludes that Google\'s copying of the API to
reimplement a user interface, taking only what was needed to allow users
to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative
program, constituted a fair use of that material as a matter of law. In
reaching this result, the Court does not overturn or modify its earlier
cases involving fair use. Pp. 1208 -- 1209.

**Opinion**

Justice [BREYER]() delivered the opinion of the Court.

**\*6** **\*\*1190** Oracle America, Inc., is the current owner of a
copyright in Java SE, a computer program that uses the popular Java
computer programming language. Google, without permission, has copied a
portion of that program, a portion that enables a programmer to call up
prewritten software that, together with the computer\'s hardware, will
carry out a large number of specific tasks. The lower courts have
considered (1) whether Java SE\'s owner could copyright the portion that
Google copied, and (2) if so, whether Google\'s copying nonetheless
constituted a "fair use" of that material, **\*7** thereby freeing
Google from copyright liability. The Federal Circuit held in Oracle\'s
favor (*i.e.*, that the portion is copyrightable and Google\'s copying
did not constitute a "fair use"). In reviewing that decision, we assume,
for argument\'s sake, that the material was copyrightable. But we hold
that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use.
Hence, Google\'s copying did not violate the copyright law.

 

I

In 2005, Google acquired Android, Inc., a startup firm that hoped to
become involved in smartphone software. Google sought, through Android,
to develop a software platform for mobile devices like smartphones. [886
F.3d 1179, 1187 (C.A. Fed. 2018)](); App. 137--138, 242--243. A platform
provides the necessary infrastructure for computer programmers to
develop new programs and applications. One might think of a software
platform as a kind of factory floor where computer programmers
(analogous to autoworkers, designers, or manufacturers) might come, use
sets of tools found there, and create new applications for use in, say,
smartphones. (For visual explanations of "platforms" and other somewhat
specialized computer-related terms, you might want to look at the
material in Appendix A, *infra*.)

 

Google envisioned an Android platform that was free and open, such that
software developers could use the tools found there free of charge. Its
idea was that more and more developers using its Android platform would
develop ever more Android-based applications, all of which would make
Google\'s Android-based smartphones more attractive to ultimate
consumers. Consumers would then buy and use ever more of those phones.
[*Oracle America, Inc. v. Google Inc.*, 872 F.Supp.2d 974, 978 (N.D.
Cal. 2012)](); App. 111, 464. That vision required attracting a sizeable
number of skilled programmers.

 

At that time, many software developers understood and wrote programs
using the Java programming language, a **\*8** language invented by Sun
Microsystems ([Oracle\'s predecessor). 872 F.Supp.2d at 975, 977]().
About six million programmers had spent considerable time learning, and
then using, the Java language. App. 228. Many of those programmers used
Sun\'s own popular Java SE platform to develop new programs primarily
for use in desktop and laptop computers. *Id*., at 151--152, 200. That
platform allowed developers using the Java language to write programs
that were able to run on any desktop or laptop computer, regardless of
the underlying hardware (*i.e.*, the programs were in large part
"interoperable"). [872 F.Supp.2d at 977](). Indeed, one of Sun\'s
slogans was " 'write once, run anywhere.' " [886 F.3d at 1186]().

 

Shortly after acquiring the Android firm, Google began talks with Sun
about **\*\*1191** the possibility of licensing the entire Java platform
for its new smartphone technology. [*Oracle*, 872 F.Supp.2d at 978]().
But Google did not want to insist that all programs written on the
Android platform be interoperable. [886 F.3d at 1187](). As Android\'s
founder explained, "\[t\]he whole idea about \[an\] open source
\[platform\] is to have very, very few restrictions on what people can
do with it," App. 659, and Sun\'s interoperability policy would have
undermined that free and open business model. Apparently, for reasons
related to this disagreement, Google\'s negotiations with Sun broke
down. Google then built its own platform.

 

The record indicates that roughly 100 Google engineers worked for more
than three years to create Google\'s Android platform software. *Id.*,
at 45, 117, 212. In doing so, Google tailored the Android platform to
smartphone technology, which differs from desktop and laptop computers
in important ways. A smartphone, for instance, may run on a more limited
battery or take advantage of GPS technology. *Id.,* at 197--198. The
Android platform offered programmers the ability to program for that
environment. To build the platform, Google wrote millions of lines of
new code. Because **\*9** Google wanted millions of programmers,
familiar with Java, to be able easily to work with its new Android
platform, it also copied roughly 11,500 lines of code from the [Java SE
program. 886 F.3d at 1187](). The copied lines of code are part of a
tool called an Application Programming Interface, or API.

 

What is an API? The Federal Circuit described an API as a tool that
"allow\[s\] programmers to use \... prewritten code to build certain
functions into their own programs, rather than write their own code to
perform those functions from scratch." [*Oracle America, Inc. v. Google,
Inc.*, 750 F.3d 1339, 1349 (2014)](). Through an API, a programmer can
draw upon a vast library of prewritten code to carry out complex tasks.
For lay persons, including judges, juries, and many others, some
elaboration of this description may prove useful.

 

Consider in more detail just what an API does. A computer can perform
thousands, perhaps millions, of different tasks that a programmer may
wish to use. These tasks range from the most basic to the enormously
complex. Ask the computer, for example, to tell you which of two numbers
is the higher number or to sort one thousand numbers in ascending order,
and it will instantly give you the right answer. An API divides and
organizes the world of computing tasks in a particular way. Programmers
can then use the API to select the particular task that they need for
their programs. In Sun\'s API (which we refer to as the Sun Java API),
each individual task is known as a "method." The API groups somewhat
similar methods into larger "classes," and groups somewhat similar
classes into larger "packages." This method-class-package organizational
structure is referred to as the Sun Java API\'s "structure, sequence,
and organization," or SSO.

 

For each task, there is computer code, known as "implementing code,"
that in effect tells the computer how to execute the particular task you
have asked it to perform (such **\*10** as telling you, of two numbers,
which is the higher). See [*Oracle*, 872 F.Supp.2d at 979--980](). The
implementing code (which Google independently wrote) is not at issue
here. For a single task, the implementing code may be hundreds of lines
long. It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, for a programmer to
create complex software programs without drawing on prewritten
task-implementing programs to execute discrete tasks.

 

But how do you as the programmer tell the computer which of the
implementing **\*\*1192** code programs it should choose, *i.e.*, which
task it should carry out? You do so by entering into your own program a
command that corresponds to the specific task and calls it up. Those
commands, known as "method calls," help you carry out the task by
choosing those programs written in implementing code that will do the
trick, *i.e.*, that will instruct the computer so that your program will
find the higher of two numbers. If a particular computer might perform,
say, a million different tasks, different method calls will tell the
computer which of those tasks to choose. Those familiar with the Java
language already know countless method calls that allow them to invoke
countless tasks.

 

And how does the method call (which a programmer types) actually locate
and invoke the particular implementing code that it needs to instruct
the computer how to carry out a particular task? It does so through
another type of code, which the parties have labeled "declaring code."
Declaring code is part of the API. For each task, the specific command
entered by the programmer matches up with specific declaring code inside
the API. That declaring code provides both the name for each task and
the location of each task within the API\'s overall organizational
system (*i.e.,* the placement of a method within a particular class and
the placement of a class within a particular package). In this sense,
the declaring code and the method call form a link, allowing the
programmer to draw upon the thousands of prewritten tasks, **\*11**
written in implementing code. See [*id.,* at 979--980](). Without that
declaring code, the method calls entered by the programmer would not
call up the implementing code.

 

The declaring code therefore performs at least two important functions
in the Sun Java API. The first, more obvious, function is that the
declaring code enables a set of shortcuts for programmers. By connecting
complex implementing code with method calls, it allows a programmer to
pick out from the API\'s task library a particular task without having
to learn anything more than a simple command. For example, a programmer
building a new application for personal banking may wish to use various
tasks to, say, calculate a user\'s balance or authenticate a password.
To do so, she need only learn the method calls associated with those
tasks. In this way, the declaring code\'s shortcut function is similar
to a gas pedal in a car that tells the car to move faster or the QWERTY
keyboard on a typewriter that calls up a certain letter when you press a
particular key. As those analogies demonstrate, one can think of the
declaring code as part of an *interface* between human beings and a
machine.

 

The second, less obvious, function is to reflect the way in which
Java\'s creators have divided the potential world of different tasks
into an actual world, *i.e.*, precisely which set of potentially
millions of different tasks we want to have our Java-based computer
systems perform and how we want those tasks arranged and grouped. In
this sense, the declaring code performs an organizational function. It
determines the structure of the task library that Java\'s creators have
decided to build. To understand this organizational system, think of the
Dewey Decimal System that categorizes books into an accessible system or
a travel guide that arranges a city\'s attractions into different
categories. Language itself provides a rough analogy to the declaring
code\'s organizational feature, for language itself divides into sets of
concepts a world that in certain respects other languages might have
divided differently. The developers of Java, for example, decided
**\*12** to place a method called "draw image" inside of a class called
"graphics."

 

**\*\*1193** Consider a comprehensive, albeit farfetched, analogy that
illustrates how the API is actually used by a programmer. Imagine that
you can, via certain keystrokes, instruct a robot to move to a
particular file cabinet, to open a certain drawer, and to pick out a
specific recipe. With the proper recipe in hand, the robot then moves to
your kitchen and gives it to a cook to prepare the dish. This example
mirrors the API\'s task-related organizational system. Through your
simple command, the robot locates the right recipe and hands it off to
the cook. In the same way, typing in a method call prompts the API to
locate the correct implementing code and hand it off to your computer.
And importantly, to select the dish that you want for your meal, you do
not need to know the recipe\'s contents, just as a programmer using an
API does not need to learn the implementing code. In both situations,
learning the simple command is enough.

 

Now let us consider the example that the District Court used to explain
the precise technology here. [*Id.,* at 980--981](). A programmer
wishes, as part of her program, to determine which of two integers is
the larger. To do so in the Java language, she will first write
**java.lang**. Those words (which we have put in bold type) refer to the
"package" (or by analogy to the file cabinet). She will then write
**Math**. That word refers to the "class" (or by analogy to the drawer).
She will then write **max**. That word refers to the "method" (or by
analogy to the recipe). She will then make two parentheses ( ). And, in
between the parentheses she will put two integers, say 4 and 6, that she
wishes to compare. The whole expression---the method call---will look
like this: "**java.lang.Math.max(4, 6)**." The use of this expression
will, by means of the API, call up a task-implementing program that will
determine the higher number.

 

In writing this program, the programmer will use the very symbols we
have placed in bold in the precise order we have **\*13** placed them.
But the symbols by themselves do nothing. She must also use software
that connects the symbols to the equivalent of file cabinets, drawers,
and files. The API is that software. It includes both the declaring code
that links each part of the method call to the particular
task-implementing program, and the implementing code that actually
carries it out. (For an illustration of this technology, see Appendix B,
*infra*.)

 

Now we can return to the copying at issue in this case. Google did not
copy the task-implementing programs, or implementing code, from the Sun
Java API. It wrote its own task-implementing programs, such as those
that would determine which of two integers is the greater or carry out
any other desired (normally far more complex) task. This implementing
code constitutes the vast majority of both the Sun Java API and the API
that Google created for Android. App. 212. For most of the packages in
its new API, Google also wrote its own declaring code. For 37 packages,
however, Google copied the declaring code from the Sun Java API. *Id*.,
at 106--107. As just explained, that means that, for those 37 packages,
Google necessarily copied both the names given to particular tasks and
the grouping of those tasks into classes and packages.

 

In doing so, Google copied that portion of the Sun Java API that allowed
programmers expert in the Java programming language to use the "task
calling" system that they had already learned. As Google saw it, the 37
packages at issue included those tasks that were likely to prove most
useful to programmers working on applications for mobile devices. In
fact, "three of these packages were \... **\*\*1194** fundamental to
being able to use the Java language at all." [*Oracle*, 872 F.Supp.2d at
982](). By using the same declaring code for those packages, programmers
using the Android platform can rely on the method calls that they are
already familiar with to call up particular tasks (*e.g.*, determining
which of two integers is the greater); but Google\'s own implementing
**\*14** programs carry out those tasks. Without that copying,
programmers would need to learn an entirely new system to call up the
same tasks.

 

We add that the Android platform has been successful. Within five years
of its release in 2007, Android-based devices claimed a large share of
the United States market. [*Id.,* at 978](). As of 2015, Android sales
produced more than \$42 billion in revenue. [886 F.3d at 1187]().

 

In 2010 Oracle Corporation bought Sun. Soon thereafter Oracle brought
this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California.

 

II

The case has a complex and lengthy history. At the outset Oracle
complained that Google\'s use of the Sun Java API violated both
copyright and patent laws. For its copyright claim, Oracle alleged that
Google infringed its copyright by copying, for 37 packages, both the
literal declaring code and the nonliteral organizational structure (or
SSO) of the API, *i.e.,* the grouping of certain methods into classes
and certain classes into packages. For trial purposes the District Court
organized three proceedings. The first would cover the copyright issues,
the second would cover the patent issues, and the third would, if
necessary, calculate damages. [*Oracle*, 872 F.Supp.2d at 975](). The
court also determined that a judge should decide whether copyright law
could protect an API and that the jury should decide whether Google\'s
use of Oracle\'s API infringed its copyright and, if so, whether a fair
use defense nonetheless applied. [*Ibid.*]()

 

After six weeks of hearing evidence, the jury rejected Oracle\'s patent
claims (which have since dropped out of the case). It also found a
limited copyright infringement. It deadlocked as to whether Google could
successfully assert a fair use defense. [*Id.,* at 976](). The judge
then decided that, regardless, the API\'s declaring code was not the
kind of creation to which copyright law extended its protection. The
**\*15** court noted that Google had written its own implementing code,
which constituted the vast majority of its API. It wrote that "anyone is
free under the Copyright Act to write his or her own code to carry out
exactly the same" tasks that the Sun Java API picks out or specifies.
[*Ibid*.]() Google copied only the declaring code and organizational
structure that was necessary for Java-trained programmers to activate
familiar tasks (while, as we said, writing its own implementing code).
Hence the copied material, in the judge\'s view, was a "system or method
of operation," which copyright law specifically states cannot be
copyrighted. [*Id.,* at 977]() (citing [17 U.S.C. § 102(b)]()).

 

On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed. That court held that both the
API\'s declaring code and its organizational structure could be
copyrighted. [*Oracle*, 750 F.3d at 1354](). It pointed out that Google
could have written its own declaring code just as it wrote its own
implementing code. And because in principle Google might have created a
whole new system of dividing and labeling tasks that could be called up
by programmers, the declaring code (and the system) that made up the Sun
Java API was copyrightable. [*Id.,* at 1361]().

 

The Federal Circuit also rejected Oracle\'s plea that it decide whether
Google had the right to use the Sun Java API because doing so was a
"fair use," immune **\*\*1195** from copyright liability. The Circuit
wrote that fair use "both permits and requires 'courts to avoid rigid
application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle
the very creativity which that law is designed to foster.' " [*Id.,* at
1372--1373](). But, it added, this "is not a case in which the record
contains sufficient factual findings upon which we could base a de novo
assessment of Google\'s affirmative defense of fair use." [*Id.,* at
1377](). And it remanded the case for another trial on that question.
Google petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, seeking review of
the Federal Circuit\'s copyrightability determination. We denied the
petition. [*Google, Inc. v. Oracle America, Inc.*, 576 U.S. 1071, 135
S.Ct. 2887, 192 L.Ed.2d 948 (2015)]().

 

**\*16** On remand the District Court, sitting with a jury, heard
evidence for a week. The court instructed the jury to answer one
question: Has Google "shown by a preponderance of the evidence that its
use in Android" of the declaring code and organizational structure
contained in the 37 Sun Java API packages that it copied "constitutes a
'fair use' under the Copyright Act?" App. 294. After three days of
deliberation the jury answered the question in the affirmative. *Id.*,
at 295. Google had shown fair use.

 

Oracle again appealed to the Federal Circuit. And the Circuit again
reversed the District Court. The Federal Circuit assumed all factual
questions in Google\'s favor. But, it said, the question whether those
facts constitute a "fair use" is a question of law. [886 F.3d at
1193](). Deciding that question of law, the court held that Google\'s
use of the Sun Java API was not a fair use. It wrote that "\[t\]here is
nothing fair about taking a copyrighted work verbatim and using it for
the same purpose and function as the original in a competing platform."
[*Id.,* at 1210](). It remanded the case again, this time for a trial on
damages.

 

Google then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court. It asked us
to review the Federal Circuit\'s determinations as to both
copyrightability and fair use. We granted its petition.

A

Copyright and patents, the Constitution says, are to "promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to
Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings
and Discoveries." Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Copyright statutes and case law
have made clear that copyright has practical objectives. It grants an
author an exclusive right to produce his work (sometimes for a hundred
years or more), not as a special reward, but in order to encourage the
production of works that others might reproduce more cheaply. At the
same time, copyright **\*17** has negative features. Protection can
raise prices to consumers. It can impose special costs, such as the cost
of contacting owners to obtain reproduction permission. And the
exclusive rights it awards can sometimes stand in the way of others
exercising their own creative powers. See generally [*Twentieth Century
Music Corp. v. Aiken*, 422 U.S. 151, 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040, 45 L.Ed.2d 84
(1975)](); [*Mazer v. Stein*, 347 U.S. 201, 219, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed.
630 (1954)]().

 

Macaulay once said that the principle of copyright is a "tax on readers
for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers." T. Macaulay, Speeches on
Copyright 25 (E. Miller ed. 1913). Congress, weighing advantages and
disadvantages, will determine the more specific nature of the tax, its
boundaries and conditions, the existence of exceptions and exemptions,
all by **\*\*1196** exercising its own constitutional power to write a
copyright statute.

 

[**^\[1\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F12053376261_1)Four provisions of the
current Copyright Act are of particular relevance in this case. First, a
definitional provision sets forth three basic conditions for obtaining a
copyright. There must be a "wor\[k\] of authorship," that work must be
"original," and the work must be "fixed in any tangible medium of
expression." [17 U.S.C. § 102(a)](); see also [*Feist Publications, Inc.
v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113
L.Ed.2d 358 (1991)]() (explaining that copyright requires some original
"creative spark" and therefore does not reach the facts that a
particular expression describes).

 

Second, the statute lists certain kinds of works that copyright can
protect. They include "literary," "musical," "dramatic," "motion
pictur\[e\]," "architectural," and certain other works. [§ 102(a)](). In
1980, Congress expanded the reach of the Copyright Act to include
computer programs. And it defined "computer program" as " 'a set of
statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a
computer in order to bring about a certain result.' " § 10, 94 Stat.
3028 (codified at [17 U.S.C. § 101]()).

 

[**^\[2\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F22053376261_1)Third, the statute sets forth
limitations on the works that can be copyrighted, including works that
the definitional provisions **\*18** might otherwise include. It says,
for example, that copyright protection cannot be extended to "any idea,
procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or
discovery \...." [§ 102(b)](). These limitations, along with the need to
"fix" a work in a "tangible medium of expression," have often led courts
to say, in shorthand form, that, unlike patents, which protect novel and
useful ideas, copyrights protect "expression" but not the "ideas" that
lie behind it. See [*Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp.*, 81 F.2d
49, 54 (C.A.2 1936)]() (Hand, J.); B. Kaplan, An Unhurried View of
Copyright 46--52 (1967).

 

Fourth, Congress, together with the courts, has imposed limitations upon
the scope of copyright protection even in respect to works that are
entitled to a copyright. For example, the Copyright Act limits an
author\'s exclusive rights in performances and displays, § 110, or to
performances of sound recordings, § 114. And directly relevant here, a
copyright holder cannot prevent another person from making a "fair use"
of copyrighted material. § 107.

 

[**^\[3\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F32053376261_1)We have described the "fair
use" doctrine, originating in the courts, as an "equitable rule of
reason" that "permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright
statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity which
that law is designed to foster." [*Stewart v. Abend*, 495 U.S. 207, 236,
110 S.Ct. 1750, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990)]() (internal quotation marks
omitted). The statutory provision that embodies the doctrine indicates,
rather than dictates, how courts should apply it. The provision says:

> "\[T\]he fair use of a copyrighted work, \... for purposes such as
> criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching \... scholarship, or
> research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether
> the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the
> factors to be considered shall include---
>
> **\*19** "(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
> such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational
> purposes;
>
> "(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
>
> "(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
> the copyrighted work as a whole; and
>
> **\*\*1197** "(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for
> or value of the copyrighted work." § 107.

 

[**^\[4\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F42053376261_1)In applying this provision,
we, like other courts, have understood that the provision\'s list of
factors is not exhaustive (note the words "include" and "including"),
that the examples it sets forth do not exclude other examples (note the
words "such as"), and that some factors may prove more important in some
contexts than in others. See [*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510
U.S. 569, 577, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)](); [*Harper &
Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises*, 471 U.S. 539, 560, 105

Standard, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1110 (1990)]() (Leval) ("The factors
do not represent a score card that promises victory to the winner of the
majority"). In a word, we have understood the provision to set forth
general principles, the application of which requires judicial
balancing, depending upon relevant circumstances, including "significant
changes in technology." [*Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City
Studios, Inc.*, 464 U.S. 417, 430, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574
(1984)](); see also [*Aiken*, 422 U.S., at 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040]() ("When
technological change has rendered its literal terms ambiguous, the
Copyright Act must be construed in light of its basic purpose").

Google\'s petition for certiorari poses two questions. The first asks
whether Java\'s API is copyrightable. It asks us to examine two of the
statutory provisions just mentioned, one that permits copyrighting
computer programs and the other that forbids copyrighting, *e.g.*,
"process\[es\]," "system\[s\]," **\*20** and "method\[s\] of operation."
Pet. for Cert. 12. Google believes that the API\'s declaring code and
organization fall into these latter categories and are expressly
excluded from copyright protection. The second question asks us to
determine whether Google\'s use of the API was a "fair use." Google
believes that it was.

 

A holding for Google on either question presented would dispense with
Oracle\'s copyright claims. Given the rapidly changing technological,
economic, and business-related circumstances, we believe we should not
answer more than is necessary to resolve the parties' dispute. We shall
assume, but purely for argument\'s sake, that the entire Sun Java API
falls within the definition of that which can be copyrighted. We shall
ask instead whether Google\'s use of part of that API was a "fair use."
Unlike the Federal Circuit, we conclude that it was.

 

IV

[**^\[5\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F52053376261_1)The language of § 107, the
"fair use" provision, reflects its judge-made origins. It is similar to
that used by Justice Story in [*Folsom v. Marsh*, 9 F.Cas. 342, 348 (No.
4,901) (C.C. D.Mass. 1841)](). See [*Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 576, 114
S.Ct. 1164]() (noting how "Justice Story\'s summary \[of fair use
considerations\] is discernable" in § 107). That background, as well as
modern courts' use of the doctrine, makes clear that the concept is
flexible, that courts must apply it in light of the sometimes
conflicting aims of copyright law, and that its application may well
vary depending upon context. Thus, copyright\'s protection may be
stronger where the copyrighted material is fiction, not fact, where it
consists of a motion picture rather than a news broadcast, or where it
serves an artistic rather than a utilitarian function. See, *e.g.*,
[*Stewart*, 495 U.S., at 237--238, 110 S.Ct. 1750](); [*Harper & Row*,
471 U.S., at 563, 105 S.Ct. 2218](); see also 4 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer,
Copyright § 13.05\[A\] \[2\]\[a\] (2019) (hereinafter Nimmer on
Copyright) **\*\*1198** ("\[C\]opyright protection is narrower, and the
corresponding application of the fair use defense greater, in the case
of factual works than in the case **\*21** of works of fiction or
fantasy"). Similarly, courts have held that in some circumstances, say,
where copyrightable material is bound up with uncopyrightable material,
copyright protection is "thin." See [*Feist*, 499 U.S., at 349, 111
S.Ct. 1282]() (noting that "the copyright in a factual compilation is
thin"); see also [*Experian Information Solutions, Inc. v. Nationwide
Marketing Servs. Inc.*, 893 F.3d 1176, 1186 (C.A.9 2018)]() ("In the
context of factual compilations, \... there can be no infringement
unless the works are virtually identical" (internal quotation marks
omitted)).

 

Generically speaking, computer programs differ from books, films, and
many other "literary works" in that such programs almost always serve
functional purposes. These and other differences have led at least some
judges to complain that "applying copyright law to computer programs is
like assembling a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces do not quite fit." [*Lotus
Development Corp. v. Borland Int\'l, Inc.*, 49 F.3d 807, 820 (C.A.1
1995)]() (BOUDIN, J., concurring).

 

These differences also led Congress to think long and hard about whether
to grant computer programs copyright protection. In 1974, Congress
established a National Commission on New Technological Uses of
Copyrighted Works (CONTU) to look into the matter. §§ 201--208, 88 Stat.
1873--1875. After several years of research, CONTU concluded that the
"availability of copyright protection for computer programs is
desirable." Final Report 11 (July 31, 1978). At the same time, it
recognized that computer programs had unique features. Mindful of not
"unduly burdening users of programs and the general public," it wrote
that copyright "should not grant anyone more economic power than is
necessary to achieve the incentive to create." *Id.,* at 12. And it
believed that copyright\'s existing doctrines (*e.g.*, fair use),
applied by courts on a case-by-case basis, could prevent holders from
using copyright to stifle innovation. *Ibid.* ("Relatively few changes
in the Copyright Act of 1976 are required to attain these objectives").
Congress then wrote computer program protection into the law. See § 10,
94 Stat. 3028.

 

**\*22** [**^\[6\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F62053376261_1)The upshot, in our
view, is that fair use can play an important role in determining the
lawful scope of a computer program copyright, such as the copyright at
issue here. It can help to distinguish among technologies. It can
distinguish between expressive and functional features of computer code
where those features are mixed. It can focus on the legitimate need to
provide incentives to produce copyrighted material while examining the
extent to which yet further protection creates unrelated or illegitimate
harms in other markets or to the development of other products. In a
word, it can carry out its basic purpose of providing a context-based
check that can help to keep a copyright monopoly within its lawful
bounds. See [H. R. Rep. No. 94--1476, pp. 65--66]() (1976) (explaining
that courts are to "adapt the doctrine \[of fair use\] to particular
situations on a case-by-case basis" and in light of "rapid technological
change"); see, *e.g.,* [*Lexmark Int\'l, Inc. v. Static Control
Components, Inc.*, 387 F.3d 522, 543--545 (C.A.6 2004)]() (discussing
fair use in the context of copying to preserve compatibility); [*Sony
Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp.*, 203 F.3d 596, 603--608
(C.A.9 2000)]() (applying fair use to intermediate copying necessary to
reverse engineer access to unprotected functional elements within a
program); **\*\*1199** [*Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.*, 977
F.2d 1510, 1521--1527 (C.A.9 1992)]() (holding that wholesale copying of
copyrighted code as a preliminary step to develop a competing product
was a fair use).

 

Justice THOMAS' thoughtful dissent offers a very different view of how
(and perhaps whether) fair use has any role to play for computer
programs. We are told that no attempt to distinguish among computer code
is tenable when considering "the nature of the work," see *post*, at
1215 -- 12016, even though there are important distinctions in the ways
that programs are used and designed, *post*, at 1220 ("The declaring
code is what attracted programmers"). We are told that no reuse of code
in a new program will ever have a valid "purpose and character," *post*,
at 1218 -- 1219, even though the reasons for copying **\*23** computer
code may vary greatly and differ from those applicable to other sorts of
works, *ibid.* (accepting that copying as part of "reverse
engineer\[ing\] a system to ensure compatibility" could be a valid
purpose). And we are told that our fair use analysis must prioritize
certain factors over others, *post*, at 1215, n. 5, even though our case
law instructs that fair use depends on the context, see [*Campbell*, 510
U.S., at 577--578, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

We do not understand Congress, however, to have shielded computer
programs from the ordinary application of copyright\'s limiting
doctrines in this way. By defining computer programs in [§ 101](),
Congress chose to place this subject matter within the copyright regime.
Like other protected works, that means that the owners of computer
programs enjoy the exclusive rights set forth in the Act, including the
right to "reproduce \[a\] copyrighted work" or to "prepare derivative
works." [17 U.S.C. § 106](). But that also means that exclusive rights
in computer programs are limited like any other works. Just as fair use
distinguishes among books and films, which are indisputably subjects of
copyright, so too must it draw lines among computer programs. And just
as fair use takes account of the market in which scripts and paintings
are bought and sold, so too must it consider the realities of how
technological works are created and disseminated. We do not believe that
an approach close to "all or nothing" would be faithful to the Copyright
Act\'s overall design.

 

V

[**^\[7\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F72053376261_1)At the outset, Google argues
that "fair use" is a question for a jury to decide; here the jury
decided the question in Google\'s favor; and we should limit our review
to determining whether "substantial evidence" justified the jury\'s
decision. The Federal Circuit disagreed. It thought that the "fair use"
question was a mixed question of fact and law; that reviewing courts
should appropriately defer to the jury\'s findings of underlying facts;
but that the ultimate question **\*24** whether those facts showed a
"fair use" is a legal question for judges to decide *de novo*.

 

We agree with the Federal Circuit\'s answer to this question. We have
said, "\[f\]air use is a mixed question of law and fact." [*Harper &
Row*, 471 U.S., at 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218](). We have explained that a
reviewing court should try to break such a question into its separate
factual and legal parts, reviewing each according to the appropriate
legal standard. But when a question can be reduced no further, we have
added that "the standard of review for a mixed question all depends---on
whether answering it entails primarily legal or factual work." [*U. S.
Bank N. A.* v. *Village at Lakeridge, LLC*, 583 U. S. --------,
--------, 138 S.Ct. 960, 967, 200 L.Ed.2d 218 (2018)]().

 

In this case, the ultimate "fair use" question primarily involves legal
work. "Fair use" was originally a concept fashioned **\*\*1200** by
judges. [*Folsom*, 9 F.Cas. at 348](). Our cases still provide legal
interpretations of the fair use provision. And those interpretations
provide general guidance for future cases. See, *e.g.*, [*Campbell*, 510
U.S., at 592--593, 114 S.Ct. 1164]() (describing kinds of market harms
that are not the concern of copyright); [*Harper & Row*, 471 U.S., at
564, 105 S.Ct. 2218]() ("scope of fair use is narrower with respect to
unpublished works"); [*Sony*, 464 U.S., at 451, 104 S.Ct. 774]()
(wholesale copying aimed at creating a market substitute is
presumptively unfair). This type of work is legal work. [*U. S. Bank*,
583 U. S., at --------, 138 S.Ct., at 967]() ("When applying the law
involves developing auxiliary legal principles for use in other
cases\[,\] appellate courts should typically review a decision *de
novo*").

 

Applying a legal "fair use" conclusion may, of course, involve
determination of subsidiary factual questions, such as "whether there
was harm to the actual or potential markets for the copyrighted work" or
"how much of the copyrighted work was copied." [886 F.3d at 1196]();
see, *e.g.,* [*Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Development
Corp.*, 602 F.3d 57, 63 (C.A.2 2010)]() (noting that in an infringement
suit "the question of substantial similarity typically presents an
extremely close question of fact"). In this case the Federal **\*25**
Circuit carefully applied the fact/law principles we set forth in [*U.
S. Bank*](), leaving factual determinations to the jury and reviewing
the ultimate question, a legal question, *de novo*.

 

[**^\[8\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F82053376261_1)Next, Google argues that the
Federal Circuit\'s approach violates the Seventh Amendment. The
Amendment both requires that "the right of trial by jury \... be
preserved" and forbids courts to "re-examin\[e\]" any "fact tried by a
jury." U. S. Const., Amdt. 7; see also [*Gasperini v. Center for
Humanities, Inc.*, 518 U.S. 415, 432--433, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d
659 (1996)](). The Reexamination Clause is no bar here, however, for, as
we have said, the ultimate question here is one of law, not fact. It
does not violate the Reexamination Clause for a court to determine the
controlling law in resolving a challenge to a jury verdict, as happens
any time a court resolves a motion for judgment as a matter of law. See,
*e.g.,* [*Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co.*, 386 U.S. 317, 322, 87
S.Ct. 1072, 18 L.Ed.2d 75 (1967)]().

 

[**^\[9\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F92053376261_1)Nor is Google correct that
"the right of trial by jury" includes the right to have a jury resolve a
fair use defense. That Clause is concerned with "the particular trial
decision" at issue. [*Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.*, 517 U.S.
370, 376, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996)](). Even though it is
possible to find pre-Revolutionary English cases in which a judge sent
related questions like fair abridgment to a jury, those questions were
significantly different from the "fair use" doctrine as courts apply it
today. See, *e.g.*, *Gyles* v. *Wilcox*, 2 Atk. 141, 142--144, 26 Eng.
Rep. 489, 490--491 (Ch. 1740) (asking the Court to resolve the narrow
question whether a shortened work could be considered a new work);
*Sayre* v. *Moore*, 1 East 361, n., 102 Eng. Rep. 138, 139, n. (K. B.
1785) (discussing the jury\'s role in resolving whether copying
constituted infringement). As far as contemporary fair use is concerned,
we have described the doctrine as an "equitable," not a "legal,"
doctrine. We have found no case suggesting that application of [*U. S.
Bank*]() here would fail "to preserve the substance of the common-law
\[jury trial\] right as it existed in 1791." [*Markman*, 517 U.S., at
376, 116 S.Ct. 1384]().

 

**\*26** VI

We turn now to the basic legal question before us: Was Google\'s copying
of the Sun Java API, specifically its use of the declaring code and
organizational structure for **\*\*1201** 37 packages of that API, a
"fair use." In answering this question, we shall consider the four
factors set forth in the fair use statute as we find them applicable to
the kind of computer programs before us. We have reproduced those four
statutory factors *supra*, at 1196 -- 1197. For expository purposes, we
begin with the second.

 

A. "The Nature of the Copyrighted Work"

[**^\[10\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F102053376261_1)The Sun Java API is a "user
interface." It provides a way through which users (here the programmers)
can "manipulate and control" task-performing computer programs "via a
series of menu commands." [*Lotus Development Corp.*, 49 F.3d at 809]().
The API reflects Sun\'s division of possible tasks that a computer might
perform into a set of actual tasks that certain kinds of computers
actually will perform. Sun decided, for example, that its API would call
up a task that compares one integer with another to see which is the
larger. Sun\'s API (to our knowledge) will not call up the task of
determining which great Arabic scholar decided to use Arabic numerals
(rather than Roman numerals) to perform that "larger integer" task. No
one claims that the decisions about what counts as a task are themselves
copyrightable---although one might argue about decisions as to how to
label and organize such tasks (*e.g.*, the decision to name a certain
task "max" or to place it in a class called "Math." Cf. [*Baker v.
Selden*, 101 U.S., 99, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1880)]()).

 

As discussed above, *supra,* at 1190 -- 1192, and in Appendix B,
*infra*, we can think of the technology as having three essential parts.
First, the API includes "implementing code," which actually instructs
the computer on the steps to follow to carry out each task. Google wrote
its own programs (implementing programs) that would perform each one of
the tasks that its API calls up.

 

**\*27** Second, the Sun Java API associates a particular command,
called a "method call," with the calling up of each task. The symbols
**java.lang.**, for example, are part of the command that will call up
the program (whether written by Sun or, as here, by Google) that
instructs the computer to carry out the "larger number" operation.
Oracle does not here argue that the use of these commands by programmers
itself violates its copyrights.

 

Third, the Sun Java API contains computer code that will associate the
writing of a method call with particular "places" in the computer that
contain the needed implementing code. This is the declaring code. The
declaring code both labels the particular tasks in the API and organizes
those tasks, or "methods," into "packages" and "classes." We have
referred to this organization, by way of rough analogy, as file
cabinets, drawers, and files. Oracle does claim that Google\'s use of
the Sun Java API\'s declaring code violates its copyrights.

 

The declaring code at issue here resembles other copyrighted works in
that it is part of a computer program. Congress has specified that
computer programs are subjects of copyright. It differs, however, from
many other kinds of copyrightable computer code. It is inextricably
bound together with a general system, the division of computing tasks,
that no one claims is a proper subject of copyright. It is inextricably
bound up with the idea of organizing tasks into what we have called
cabinets, drawers, and files, an idea that is also not copyrightable. It
is inextricably bound up with the use of specific commands known to
programmers, known here as method calls (such as **java.lang.Math.max**,
etc.), that Oracle does not here contest. And it is inextricably bound
up with implementing code, which is copyrightable but was not copied.

 

**\*\*1202** Moreover, the copied declaring code and the uncopied
implementing programs call for, and reflect, different kinds of
capabilities. A single implementation may walk a computer through dozens
of different steps. To write implementing **\*28** programs, witnesses
told the jury, requires balancing such considerations as how quickly a
computer can execute a task or the likely size of the computer\'s
memory. One witness described that creativity as "magic" practiced by an
API developer when he or she worries "about things like power
management" for devices that "run on a battery." App. 143; see also
*id*., at 147, 204. This is the very creativity that was needed to
develop the Android software for use not in laptops or desktops but in
the very different context of smartphones.

 

The declaring code (inseparable from the programmer\'s method calls)
embodies a different kind of creativity. Sun Java\'s creators, for
example, tried to find declaring code names that would prove intuitively
easy to remember. *Id*., at 211. They wanted to attract programmers who
would learn the system, help to develop it further, and prove reluctant
to use another. See *post*, at 1215 ("Declaring code \... is user
facing. It must be designed and organized in a way that is intuitive and
understandable to developers so that they can invoke it"). Sun\'s
business strategy originally emphasized the importance of using the API
to attract programmers. It sought to make the API "open" and "then \...
compete on implementations." App. 124--125. The testimony at trial was
replete with examples of witnesses drawing this critical line between
the user-centered declaratory code and the innovative implementing code.
*Id*., at 126--127, 159--160, 163--164, 187, 190--191.

 

These features mean that, as part of a user interface, the declaring
code differs to some degree from the mine run of computer programs. Like
other computer programs, it is functional in nature. But unlike many
other programs, its use is inherently bound together with
uncopyrightable ideas (general task division and organization) and new
creative expression (Android\'s implementing code). Unlike many other
programs, its value in significant part derives from the value that
those who do not hold copyrights, namely, computer programmers, **\*29**
invest of their own time and effort to learn the API\'s system. And
unlike many other programs, its value lies in its efforts to encourage
programmers to learn and to use that system so that they will use (and
continue to use) Sun-related implementing programs that Google did not
copy.

 

Although copyrights protect many different kinds of writing, Leval 1116,
we have emphasized the need to "recogni\[ze\] that some works are closer
to the core of \[copyright\] than others," [*Campbell*, 510 U.S., at
586, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). In our view, for the reasons just described, the
declaring code is, if copyrightable at all, further than are most
computer programs (such as the implementing code) from the core of
copyright. That fact diminishes the fear, expressed by both the dissent
and the Federal Circuit, that application of "fair use" here would
seriously undermine the general copyright protection that Congress
provided for computer programs. And it means that this factor, "the
nature of the copyrighted work," points in the direction of fair use.

 

B. "The Purpose and Character of the Use"

[**^\[11\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F112053376261_1)In the context of fair use,
we have considered whether the copier\'s use "adds something new, with a
further purpose or different character, altering" the copyrighted work
"with new expression, meaning or message." [*Id.*, at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164](). Commentators have put the matter more broadly, asking whether
the copier\'s **\*\*1203** use "fulfill\[s\] the objective of copyright
law to stimulate creativity for public illumination." Leval 1111. In
answering this question, we have used the word "transformative" to
describe a copying use that adds something new and important.
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S., at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). An " 'artistic
painting' " might, for example, fall within the scope of fair use even
though it precisely replicates a copyrighted " 'advertising logo to make
a comment about consumerism.' " 4 Nimmer on Copyright §
13.05\[A\]\[1\]\[b\] (quoting Netanel, **\*30** [Making Sense of Fair
Use, 15 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 715, 746 (2011)]()). Or, as we held in
[*Campbell*](), a parody can be transformative because it comments on
the original or criticizes it, for "\[p\]arody needs to mimic an
original to make its point." [510 U.S., at 580--581, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

Google copied portions of the Sun Java API precisely, and it did so in
part for the same reason that Sun created those portions, namely, to
enable programmers to call up implementing programs that would
accomplish particular tasks. But since virtually any unauthorized use of
a copyrighted computer program (say, for teaching or research) would do
the same, to stop here would severely limit the scope of fair use in the
functional context of computer programs. Rather, in determining whether
a use is "transformative," we must go further and examine the copying\'s
more specifically described "purpose\[s\]" and "character." [17 U.S.C. §
107(1)]().

 

Here Google\'s use of the Sun Java API seeks to create new products. It
seeks to expand the use and usefulness of Android-based smartphones. Its
new product offers programmers a highly creative and innovative tool for
a smartphone environment. To the extent that Google used parts of the
Sun Java API to create a new platform that could be readily used by
programmers, its use was consistent with that creative "progress" that
is the basic constitutional objective of copyright itself. Cf. [*Feist*,
499 U.S., at 349--350, 111 S.Ct. 1282]() ("The primary objective of
copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but '\[t\]o promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts' " (quoting [U. S. Const., Art. I, §
8, cl. 8]())).

 

The jury heard that Google limited its use of the Sun Java API to tasks
and specific programming demands related to Android. It copied the API
(which Sun created for use in desktop and laptop computers) only insofar
as needed to include tasks that would be useful in smartphone programs.
App. 169--170. And it did so only insofar as needed to allow programmers
to call upon those tasks without discarding a portion of a familiar
programming language and learning a **\*31** new one. *Id*., at
139--140. To repeat, Google, through Android, provided a new collection
of tasks operating in a distinct and different computing environment.
Those tasks were carried out through the use of new implementing code
(that Google wrote) designed to operate within that new environment.
Some of the *amici* refer to what Google did as "reimplementation,"
defined as the "building of a system \... that repurposes the same words
and syntaxes" of an existing system---in this case so that programmers
who had learned an existing system could put their basic skills to use
in a new one. Brief for R Street Institute et al. as *Amici Curiae* 2.

 

The record here demonstrates the numerous ways in which reimplementing
an interface can further the development of computer programs. The jury
heard that shared interfaces are necessary for different programs to
speak to each other. App. 125 ("We have to agree on the APIs so that the
application I write to show a movie runs on your device"). It heard that
the reimplementation of interfaces is necessary **\*\*1204** if
programmers are to be able to use their acquired skills. *Id.*, at 191
("If the API labels change, then either the software wouldn\'t continue
to work anymore or the developer \... would have to learn a whole new
language to be able to use these API labels"). It heard that the reuse
of APIs is common in the industry. *Id*., at 115, 155, 663. It heard
that Sun itself had used pre-existing interfaces in creating Java.
*Id.*, at 664. And it heard that Sun executives thought that widespread
use of the Java programming language, including use on a smartphone
platform, would benefit the company. *Id.*, at 130--133.

 

*Amici* supporting Google have summarized these same points---points
that witnesses explained to the jury. See, *e.g.*, Brief for Copyright
Scholars as *Amici Curiae* 25 ("\[T\]he portions of Java SE that Google
reimplemented may have helped preserve consistency of use within the
larger Java developer community"); Brief for Microsoft Corporation as
*Amicus Curiae* 22 ("\[A\]llowing reasonable fair use of functional
**\*32** code enables innovation that creates new opportunities for the
whole market to grow"); Brief for 83 Computer Scientists as *Amici
Curiae* 20 ("Reimplementing interfaces fueled widespread adoption of
popular programming languages" (emphasis deleted)); Brief for R Street
Institute et al. as *Amici Curiae* 15--20 (describing Oracle\'s
reimplementation of other APIs); see also Brief for American Antitrust
Institute as *Amicus Curiae* 7 ("Copyright on largely functional
elements of software that \[have\] become an industry standard gives a
copyright holder anti-competitive power").

 

These and related facts convince us that the "purpose and character" of
Google\'s copying was transformative---to the point where this factor
too weighs in favor of fair use.

 

There are two other considerations that are often taken up under the
first factor: commerciality and good faith. The text of [§ 107]()
includes various noncommercial uses, such as teaching and scholarship,
as paradigmatic examples of privileged copying. There is no doubt that a
finding that copying was not commercial in nature tips the scales in
favor of fair use. But the inverse is not necessarily true, as many
common fair uses are indisputably commercial. For instance, the text of
[§ 107]() includes examples like "news reporting," which is often done
for commercial profit. So even though Google\'s use was a commercial
endeavor---a fact no party disputed, see [886 F.3d at 1197]()---that is
not dispositive of the first factor, particularly in light of the
inherently transformative role that the reimplementation played in the
new Android system.

 

As for bad faith, our decision in [*Campbell*]() expressed some
skepticism about whether bad faith has any role in a fair use analysis.
[510 U.S., at 585, n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). We find this skepticism
justifiable, as "\[c\]opyright is not a privilege reserved for the
well-behaved." Leval 1126. We have no occasion here to say whether good
faith is as a general matter a helpful inquiry. We simply note that
given the strength of the other **\*33** factors pointing toward fair
use and the jury finding in Google\'s favor on hotly contested evidence,
that factbound consideration is not determinative in this context.

 

C. "The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used"

[**^\[12\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F122053376261_1)If one considers the
declaring code in isolation, the quantitative amount of what Google
copied was large. Google copied the declaring code for 37 packages of
the Sun Java API, totaling approximately 11,500 lines of code. Those
lines of code amount to virtually all the declaring code needed to call
up hundreds of different tasks. On the other hand, if one considers
**\*\*1205** the entire set of software material in the Sun Java API,
the quantitative amount copied was small. The total set of Sun Java API
computer code, including implementing code, amounted to 2.86 million
lines, of which the copied 11,500 lines were only 0.4 percent. App. 212.

 

The question here is whether those 11,500 lines of code should be viewed
in isolation or as one part of the considerably greater whole. We have
said that even a small amount of copying may fall outside of the scope
of fair use where the excerpt copied consists of the " 'heart' " of the
original work\'s creative expression. [*Harper & Row*, 471 U.S., at
564--565, 105 S.Ct. 2218](). On the other hand, copying a larger amount
of material can fall within the scope of fair use where the material
copied captures little of the material\'s creative expression or is
central to a copier\'s valid purpose. See, *e.g.*, [*Campbell*, 510
U.S., at 588, 114 S.Ct. 1164](); [*New Era Publications Int\'l, ApS v.
Carol Publishing Group*, 904 F.2d 152, 158 (C.A.2 1990)](). If a
defendant had copied one sentence in a novel, that copying may well be
insubstantial. But if that single sentence set forth one of the world\'s
shortest short stories---"When he awoke, the dinosaur was still
there."---the question looks much different, as the copied material
constitutes a small part of the novel but the entire short story. See A.
Monterroso, El Dinosaurio, in Complete Works & Other Stories 42 (E.
Grossman **\*34** transl. 1995). (In the original Spanish, the story
reads: "Cuando despertó, el dinosaurio todavía estaba allí.")

 

Several features of Google\'s copying suggest that the better way to
look at the numbers is to take into account the several million lines
that Google did not copy. For one thing, the Sun Java API is inseparably
bound to those task-implementing lines. Its purpose is to call them up.
For another, Google copied those lines not because of their creativity,
their beauty, or even (in a sense) because of their purpose. It copied
them because programmers had already learned to work with the Sun Java
API\'s system, and it would have been difficult, perhaps prohibitively
so, to attract programmers to build its Android smartphone system
without them. Further, Google\'s basic purpose was to create a different
task-related system for a different computing environment (smartphones)
and to create a platform---the Android platform---that would help
achieve and popularize that objective. The "substantiality" factor will
generally weigh in favor of fair use where, as here, the amount of
copying was tethered to a valid, and transformative, purpose. *Supra*,
at 1203 -- 1204; see [*Campbell*, 510 U.S., at 586--587, 114 S.Ct.
1164]() (explaining that the factor three "enquiry will harken back to
the first of the statutory factors, for \... the extent of permissible
copying varies with the purpose and character of the use").

 

We do not agree with the Federal Circuit\'s conclusion that Google could
have achieved its Java-compatibility objective by copying only the 170
lines of code that are "necessary to write in the Java language." [886
F.3d at 1206](). In our view, that conclusion views Google\'s legitimate
objectives too narrowly. Google\'s basic objective was not simply to
make the Java programming language usable on its Android systems. It was
to permit programmers to make use of their knowledge and experience
using the Sun Java API when they wrote new programs for smartphones with
the Android platform. In principle, Google might have created its own,
**\*35** different system of declaring code. But the jury could have
found that its doing so would not have achieved that basic objective. In
a sense, the declaring code was the key that it needed to unlock the
programmers' creative energies. And it needed those energies
**\*\*1206** to create and to improve its own innovative Android
systems.

 

We consequently believe that this "substantiality" factor weighs in
favor of fair use.

 

D. Market Effects

[**^\[13\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F132053376261_1)The fourth statutory factor
focuses upon the "effect" of the copying in the "market for or value of
the copyrighted work." [17 U.S.C. § 107(4)](). Consideration of this
factor, at least where computer programs are at issue, can prove more
complex than at first it may seem. It can require a court to consider
the amount of money that the copyright owner might lose. As we pointed
out in [*Campbell*](), "verbatim copying of the original in its entirety
for commercial purposes" may well produce a market substitute for an
author\'s work. [510 U.S., at 591, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Making a film of
an author\'s book may similarly mean potential or presumed losses to the
copyright owner. Those losses normally conflict with copyright\'s basic
objective: providing authors with exclusive rights that will spur
creative expression.

 

But a potential loss of revenue is not the whole story. We here must
consider not just the amount but also the source of the loss. As we
pointed out in [*Campbell*](), a "lethal parody, like a scathing theatre
review," may "kil\[l\] demand for the original." [*Id.*, at 591--592,
114 S.Ct. 1164](). Yet this kind of harm, even if directly translated
into foregone dollars, is not "cognizable under the Copyright Act."
[*Id.,* at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

Further, we must take into account the public benefits the copying will
likely produce. Are those benefits, for example, related to copyright\'s
concern for the creative production of new expression? Are they
comparatively important, or **\*36** unimportant, when compared with
dollar amounts likely lost (taking into account as well the nature of
the source of the loss)? Cf. [*MCA, INC. v. Wilson*, 677 F.2d 180, 183
(C.A.2 1981)]() (calling for a balancing of public benefits and losses
to copyright owner under this factor).

 

We do not say that these questions are always relevant to the
application of fair use, not even in the world of computer programs. Nor
do we say that these questions are the only questions a court might ask.
But we do find them relevant here in helping to determine the likely
market effects of Google\'s reimplementation.

 

As to the likely amount of loss, the jury could have found that Android
did not harm the actual or potential markets for Java SE. And it could
have found that Sun itself (now Oracle) would not have been able to
enter those markets successfully whether Google did, or did not, copy a
part of its API. First, evidence at trial demonstrated that, regardless
of Android\'s smartphone technology, Sun was poorly positioned to
succeed in the mobile phone market. The jury heard ample evidence that
Java SE\'s primary market was laptops and desktops. App. 99, 200. It
also heard that Sun\'s many efforts to move into the mobile phone market
had proved unsuccessful. *Id.,* at 135, 235, 671. As far back as 2006,
prior to Android\'s release, Sun\'s executives projected declining
revenue for mobile phones because of emerging smartphone technology.
*Id.,* at 240. When Sun\'s former CEO was asked directly whether Sun\'s
failure to build a smartphone was attributable to Google\'s development
of Android, he answered that it was not. *Id.,* at 650. Given the
evidence showing that Sun was beset by business challenges in developing
a mobile phone product, the jury was entitled to agree with that
assessment.

 

Second, the jury was repeatedly told that devices using Google\'s
Android platform were different in kind from those **\*\*1207** that
licensed Sun\'s technology. For instance, witnesses explained **\*37**
that the broader industry distinguished between smartphones and simpler
"feature phones." *Id.,* at 237. As to the specific devices that used
Sun-created software, the jury heard that one of these phones lacked a
touchscreen, *id.*, at 359--360, while another did not have a QWERTY
keyboard, *id.*, at 672. For other mobile devices, the evidence showed
that simpler products, like the Kindle, used Java software, *id.*, at
396, while more advanced technology, like the Kindle Fire, were built on
the Android operating system, *id.*, at 206. This record evidence
demonstrates that, rather than just "repurposing \[Sun\'s\] code from
larger computers to smaller computers," *post*, at 16, Google\'s Android
platform was part of a distinct (and more advanced) market than Java
software.

 

Looking to these important differences, Google\'s economic expert told
the jury that Android was not a market substitute for Java\'s software.
As he explained, "the two products are on very different devices," and
the Android platform, which offers "an entire mobile operating stack,"
is a "very different typ\[e\] of produc\[t\]" than Java SE, which is
"just an applications programming framework." App. 256; see also *id.*,
at 172--174. Taken together, the evidence showed that Sun\'s mobile
phone business was declining, while the market increasingly demanded a
new form of smartphone technology that Sun was never able to offer.

 

Finally, the jury also heard evidence that Sun foresaw a benefit from
the broader use of the Java programming language in a new platform like
Android, as it would further expand the network of Java-trained
programmers. *Id.*, at 131--133; see also *id.*, at 153 ("Once an API
starts getting reimplemented, you know it has succeeded"). In other
words, the jury could have understood Android and Java SE as operating
in two distinct markets. And because there are two markets at issue,
programmers learning the Java language to work in one market
(smartphones) are then able **\*38** to bring those talents to the other
market (laptops). See 4 Nimmer on Copyright § 13.05\[A\]\[4\]
(explaining that factor four asks what the impact of "widespread conduct
of the sort engaged in by the defendant" would be on the market for the
present work).

 

Oracle presented evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the Federal Circuit
held that the "market effects" factor militated against fair use in part
because Sun had tried to enter the Android market. [886 F.3d at 1209]()
(Sun sought licensing agreement with Google). But those licensing
negotiations concerned much more than 37 packages of declaring code,
covering topics like "the implementation of \[Java\'s\] code" and
"branding and cooperation" between the firms. App. 245; see also 4
Nimmer on Copyright § 13.05\[A\]\[4\] (cautioning against the "danger of
circularity posed" by considering unrealized licensing opportunities
because "it is a given in every fair use case that plaintiff suffers a
loss of a *potential* market if that potential is defined as the
theoretical market for licensing the very use at bar"). In any event,
the jury\'s fair use determination means that neither Sun\'s effort to
obtain a license nor Oracle\'s conflicting evidence can overcome
evidence indicating that, at a minimum, it would have been difficult for
Sun to enter the smartphone market, even had Google not used portions of
the Sun Java API.

 

On the other hand, Google\'s copying helped Google make a vast amount of
money from its Android platform. And enforcement of the Sun Java API
copyright might give Oracle a significant share of these funds. It is
important, however, to consider why and how Oracle might have become
**\*\*1208** entitled to this money. When a new interface, like an API
or a spreadsheet program, first comes on the market, it may attract new
users because of its expressive qualities, such as a better visual
screen or because of its superior functionality. As time passes,
however, it may be valuable for a different reason, namely, because
users, including programmers, are just used to it. They have already
learned how to work with **\*39** it. See [*Lotus Development Corp.*, 49
F.3d at 821]() (BOUDIN, J., concurring).

 

The record here is filled with evidence that this factor accounts for
Google\'s desire to use the Sun Java API. See, *e.g.,* App. 169--170,
213--214. This source of Android\'s profitability has much to do with
third parties' (say, programmers') investment in Sun Java programs. It
has correspondingly less to do with Sun\'s investment in creating the
Sun Java API. We have no reason to believe that the Copy-right Act seeks
to protect third parties' investment in learning how to operate a
created work. Cf. [*Campbell*, 510 U.S., at 591--592, 114 S.Ct. 1164]()
(discussing the need to identify those harms that are "cognizable under
the Copyright Act").

 

Finally, given programmers' investment in learning the Sun Java API, to
allow enforcement of Oracle\'s copyright here would risk harm to the
public. Given the costs and difficulties of producing alternative APIs
with similar appeal to programmers, allowing enforcement here would make
of the Sun Java API\'s declaring code a lock limiting the future
creativity of new programs. Oracle alone would hold the key. The result
could well prove highly profitable to Oracle (or other firms holding a
copyright in computer interfaces). But those profits could well flow
from creative improvements, new applications, and new uses developed by
users who have learned to work with that interface. To that extent, the
lock would interfere with, not further, copyright\'s basic creativity
objectives. See [*Connectix Corp.*, 203 F.3d at 607](); see also [*Sega
Enterprises*, 977 F.2d at 1523--1524]() ("An attempt to monopolize the
market by making it impossible for others to compete runs counter to the
statutory purpose of promoting creative expression"); [*Lexmark Int\'l*,
387 F.3d at 544]() (noting that where a subsequent user copied a
computer program to foster functionality, it was not exploiting the
programs "commercial value *as a copyrighted work*" (emphasis in
original)). After all, "copyright supplies the economic incentive to
\[both\] create and disseminate ideas," **\*40** [*Harper & Row*, 471
U.S., at 558, 105 S.Ct. 2218](), and the reimplementation of a user
interface allows creative new computer code to more easily enter the
market.

 

The uncertain nature of Sun\'s ability to compete in Android\'s market
place, the sources of its lost revenue, and the risk of
creativity-related harms to the public, when taken together, convince
that this fourth factor---market effects---also weighs in favor of fair
use.

 

\* \* \*

 

The fact that computer programs are primarily functional makes it
difficult to apply traditional copyright concepts in that technological
world. See [*Lotus Development Corp.*, 49 F.3d at 820]() (BOUDIN, J.,
concurring). In doing so here, we have not changed the nature of those
concepts. We do not overturn or modify our earlier cases involving fair
use---cases, for example, that involve "knockoff " products,
journalistic writings, and parodies. Rather, we here recognize that
application of a copyright doctrine such as fair use has long proved a
cooperative effort of Legislatures and courts, and that Congress, in our
view, intended that it so continue. As such, we have looked to the
principles set forth in the fair use statute, [§ 107](), and set forth
in **\*\*1209** our earlier cases, and applied them to this different
kind of copyrighted work.

 

We reach the conclusion that in this case, where Google reimplemented a
user interface, taking only what was needed to allow users to put their
accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, Google\'s
copying of the Sun Java API was a fair use of that material as a matter
of law. The Federal Circuit\'s contrary judgment is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this
opinion.

 

It is so ordered.

 

Justice [BARRETT]() took no part in the consideration or decision of
this case.

**\*41** APPENDIX A

Computer System Diagram

Some readers might find it helpful to start with an explanation of what
a "software platform" is. Put simply, a software platform collects all
of the software tools that a programmer may need to build computer
programs. The Android platform, for instance, includes an "operating
system," "core libraries," and a "virtual machine," among other tools.
App. 197--198.

 

The diagram below illustrates the general features of a standard
computer system, with the dotted line reflecting the division between a
computer\'s hardware and its software. (It is not intended to reflect
any specific technology at issue in this case.)

Sun Java API Diagram

[​]()

This image depicts the connection between the three parts of the Sun
Java API technology at issue, using the District Court\'s example.
[*Oracle*, 872 F.Supp.2d at 980--981](). The programmer enters a method
call to invoke a task from within the API (the solid arrow). The precise
symbols in the method call correspond to a single task, which is located
within a particular class. That class is located within a particular
package. All of the lines of code that provide that organization and
name the methods, classes, and packages are "declaring code." For each
method, the declaring code is associated with particular lines of
implementing code (the dotted arrow). It is that implementing code
(which Google wrote for its Android API) that actually instructs the
computer in the programmer\'s application.

 

Justice [THOMAS](), with whom Justice [ALITO]() joins, dissenting.

**\*43** Oracle spent years developing a programming library that
successfully attracted software developers, thus enhancing the value of
Oracle\'s products.[]{#co_fnRef_B00022053376261_ID0ENZBK_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00022053376261_1) Google sought a license to
use the library in Android, the operating system it was developing for
mobile phones. But when the companies could not agree on terms, Google
simply copied verbatim 11,500 lines of code from the library. As a
result, it erased 97.5% of **\*\*1211** the value of Oracle\'s
partnership with Amazon, made tens of billions of dollars, and
established its position as the owner of the largest mobile operating
system in the world. Despite this, the majority holds that this copying
was fair use.

 

The Court reaches this unlikely result in large part because it bypasses
the antecedent question clearly before us: Is the software code at issue
here protected by the Copyright Act? The majority purports to assume,
without deciding, that the code is protected. But its fair-use analysis
is wholly inconsistent with the substantial protection Congress gave to
computer code. By skipping over the copyrightability question, the
majority disregards half the relevant statutory text and distorts its
fair-use analysis. Properly considering that statutory text, Oracle\'s
code at issue here is copyrightable, and Google\'s use of that
copyrighted code was anything but fair.

 

I

In the 1990s, Oracle created a programming language called Java. Like
many programming languages, Java allows developers to prewrite small
subprograms called "methods." Methods form the building blocks of more
complex programs. This process is not unlike what legislatures do with
statutes. To save space and time, legislatures define terms and then use
those definitions as a shorthand. For example, the legal definition for
"refugee" is more than **\*44** 300 words long. [8 U.S.C. § 1101(42)]().
Rather than repeat all those words every time they are relevant, the U.
S. Code encapsulates them all with a single term that it then inserts
into each relevant section. Java methods work similarly. Once a method
has been defined, a developer need only type a few characters (the
method name and relevant inputs) to invoke everything contained in the
subprogram. A programmer familiar with prewritten methods can string
many of them together to quickly develop complicated programs without
having to write from scratch all the basic subprograms.

 

To create Java methods, developers use two kinds of code. The first,
"declaring code," names the method, defines what information it can
process, and defines what kind of data it can output. It is like the
defined term in a statute. The second, "implementing code," includes the
step-by-step instructions that make those methods
run.[]{#co_fnRef_B00032053376261_ID0EE5BK_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00032053376261_1) It is like the detailed
definition in a statute.

 

Oracle\'s declaring code was central to its business model. Oracle
profited financially by encouraging developers to create programs
written in Java and then charging manufacturers a fee to embed in their
devices the Java software platform needed to run those programs. To this
end, Oracle created a work called Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition,
which included a highly organized library containing about 30,000
methods. Oracle gave developers free access to these **\*45** methods to
encourage them to write programs for the Java platform. In return,
developers were required to make their programs compatible with the Java
platform on any device. Developers **\*\*1212** were encouraged to make
improvements to the platform, but they were required to release
beneficial modifications to the public. If a company wanted to customize
the platform and keep those customizations secret for business purposes,
it had to pay for a separate license.

 

By 2005, many companies were racing to develop operating systems for
what would become modern smartphones. Oracle\'s strategy had
successfully encouraged millions of programmers to learn Java. As a
result, Java software platforms were in the vast majority of mobile
phones. Google wanted to attract those programmers to Android by
including in Android the declaring code with which they were now
familiar. But the founder of Android, Andrew Rubin, understood that the
declaring code was copyrighted, so Google sought a custom license from
Oracle. At least four times between 2005 and 2006, the two companies
attempted to negotiate a license, but they were unsuccessful, in part
because of "trust issues." App. 657.

 

When those negotiations broke down, Google simply decided to use
Oracle\'s code anyway. Instead of creating its own declaring code---as
Apple and Microsoft chose to do---Google copied verbatim 11,500 lines of
Oracle\'s declaring code and arranged that code exactly as Oracle had
done. It then advertised Android to device manufacturers as containing
"Core Java Libraries." *Id*., at 600. Oracle predictably responded by
suing Google for copyright infringement. The Federal Circuit ruled that
Oracle\'s declaring code is copyrightable and that Google\'s copying of
it was not fair use.

 

II

The Court wrongly sidesteps the principal question that we were asked to
answer: Is declaring code protected by copyright? I would hold that it
is.

 

**\*46** Computer code occupies a unique space in intellectual property.
Copyright law generally protects works of authorship. Patent law
generally protects inventions or discoveries. A library of code
straddles these two categories. It is highly functional like an
invention; yet as a writing, it is also a work of authorship. Faced with
something that could fit in either space, Congress chose copyright, and
it included declaring code in that protection.

 

The Copyright Act expressly protects computer code. It recognizes that a
"computer program" is protected by copyright. See [17 U.S.C. §§
109(b)](), [117](), [506(a)](). And it defines " 'computer program' " as
"a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly
in a computer in order to bring about a certain result." [§ 101](). That
definition clearly covers declaring code---sets of statements that
indirectly perform computer functions by triggering prewritten
implementing code.

 

Even without that express language, declaring code would satisfy the
general test for copyrightability. "Copyright protection subsists \...
in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of
expression." [§ 102(a)](). "Works of authorship include \... literary
works," which are "works \... expressed in words, numbers, or other
verbal or numerical symbols." [§§ 101](), [102(a)](). And a work is
"original" if it is "independently created by the author" and "possesses
at least some minimal degree of creativity." [*Feist Publications, Inc.
v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113
L.Ed.2d 358 (1991)](). The lines of declaring code in the Java platform
readily satisfy this "extremely low" threshold. *[Ibid.]()* First, they
are expressed in "words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols"
and are thus works of authorship. [§ 101](). Second, as Google concedes,
the lines of declaring **\*\*1213** code are original because Oracle
could have created them any number of ways.

 

Google contends that declaring code is a "method of operation" and thus
excluded from protection by [§ 102(b)](). That **\*47** subsection
excludes from copyright protection "any idea, procedure, process,
system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery,
regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated,
or embodied." This provision codifies the "idea/expression dichotomy"
that copyright protection covers only the "the author\'s expression" of
an idea, not the idea itself. [*Golan v. Holder*, 565 U.S. 302, 328, 132
S.Ct. 873, 181 L.Ed.2d 835 (2012)](). A property right in the idea
itself "can only be secured, if it can be secured at all, by
letters-patent." [*Baker v. Selden*, 101 U.S. 99, 105, 25 L.Ed. 841
(1880)](). Thus, for example, a "method of book-keeping" is not
protected by copyright, but the expression describing that accounting
method is. [*Id.*, at 101--102](). So too, a person who writes a book
inventing the idea of declaring code has a copyright protection in the
expression in the book, but not in the idea of declaring code itself.
Google acknowledges that implementing code is protected by the Copyright
Act, but it contends that declaring code is much more functional and
thus is a "method of operation" outside the scope of protection.

 

That argument fails. As the majority correctly recognizes, declaring
code and implementing code are "inextricably bound" together. *Ante*, at
1201. Declaring code defines the scope of a set of implementing code and
gives a programmer a way to use it by shortcut. Because declaring code
incorporates implementing code, it has no function on its own.
Implementing code is similar. Absent declaring code, developers would
have to write every program from scratch, making complex programs
prohibitively time consuming to create. The functionality of both
declaring code and implementing code will thus typically rise and fall
together.

 

Google\'s argument also cannot account for Congress' decision to define
protected computer code as "a set of statements or instructions to be
used *directly or indirectly* in a computer in order to bring about a
certain result." [§ 101]() (emphasis added). Hence, Congress rejected
any categorical **\*48** distinction between declaring and implementing
code. Implementing code orders a computer operation directly. Declaring
code does so indirectly by incorporating implementing code. When faced
with general language barring protection for "methods of operation" and
specific language protecting declaring code, the " 'specific governs the
general.' " [*RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank*, 566 U.S.
639, 645, 132 S.Ct. 2065, 182 L.Ed.2d 967 (2012)]().

 

This context makes clear that the phrase "method of operation" in [§
102(b)]() does not remove protection from declaring code simply because
it is functional. That interpretation does not, however, render "method
of operation" meaningless. It is "given more precise content by the
neighboring words with which it is associated." [*United States v.
Williams*, 553 U.S. 285, 294, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008)]().
Other terms in the same subsection such as "idea," "principle," and
"concept" suggest that "method of operation" covers the functions and
ideas implemented by computer code---such as math functions, accounting
methods, or the idea of declaring code---not the specific expression
Oracle created. Oracle cannot copyright the idea of using declaring
code, but it can copyright the specific expression of that idea found in
its library.

 

Google also contends that declaring code is not copyrightable because
the "merger doctrine" bars copyright protection when **\*\*1214** there
is only one way to express an idea. That argument fails for the same
reasons Google\'s [§ 102(b)]() argument fails. Even if the doctrine
exists, Google admits that it is merely an application of [§ 102(b)]().
And, in any event, there may have been only one way for Google to copy
the lines of declaring code, but there were innumerable ways for Oracle
to write them. Certainly, Apple and Microsoft managed to create their
own declaring code.

 

III

The Court inexplicably declines to address copyrightability. Its sole
stated reason is that "technological, economic, **\*49** and
business-related circumstances" are "rapidly changing." *Ante*, at 1197
-- 1198. That, of course, has been a constant where computers are
concerned.

 

Rather than address this principal question, the Court simply assumes
that declaring code is protected and then concludes that every fair-use
factor favors Google. I agree with the majority that Congress did not
"shiel\[d\] computer programs from the ordinary application" of fair
use. *Ante,* at 1199. But the majority\'s application of fair use is far
from ordinary. By skipping copyrightability, the majority gets the
methodology backward, causing the Court to sidestep a key conclusion
that ineluctably affects the fair-use analysis: Congress rejected
categorical distinctions between declaring and implementing code. But
the majority creates just such a distinction. The result of this
distorting analysis is an opinion that makes it difficult to imagine any
circumstance in which declaring code will remain protected by copyright.

 

I agree with the majority that, under our precedent, fair use is a mixed
question of fact and law and that questions of law
predominate.[]{#co_fnRef_B00042053376261_ID0EX1CK_1
.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00042053376261_1) Because the jury issued a
finding of fair use in favor of Google, we must construe all factual
disputes and inferences in Google\'s favor and ask whether the evidence
was sufficient as a matter of law to support the jury\'s verdict. See
[Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b)](). But whether a statutory fair-use factor
favors one side or the other is a **\*50** legal question reviewed *de
novo*. Congress has established four statutory fair-use factors for
courts to weigh.[]{#co_fnRef_B00052053376261_ID0EZ2CK_1
.anchor}[^4^](#co_footnote_B00052053376261_1) Three decisively favor
Oracle. And even assuming that the remaining factor favors Google, that
factor, without more, cannot legally establish fair use in this context.

 

The majority holds otherwise---concluding that *every* factor favors
Google---by relying, in large part, on a distinction it draws between
declaring and implementing code, a distinction that the statute rejects.
Tellingly, the majority evaluates **\*\*1215** the factors neither in
sequential order nor in order of importance (at least two factors are
more important under our
precedent[]{#co_fnRef_B00062053376261_ID0ERBDK_1
.anchor}[^5^](#co_footnote_B00062053376261_1)). Instead, it starts with
the second factor: the nature of the copyrighted work. It proceeds in
this manner in order to create a distinction between declaring and
implementing code that renders the former less worthy of protection than
the latter. Because the majority\'s mistaken analysis rests so heavily
on this factor, I begin with it as well.

 

A. The Nature of the Copyrighted Work

This factor requires courts to assess the level of creativity or
functionality in the original work. It generally favors fair use when a
copyrighted work is more "informational or functional" than "creative."
4 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, **\*51** Copyright § 13.05\[A\]\[2\]\[a\]
(2019). Because code is predominantly functional, this factor will often
favor copying when the original work is computer code. But because
Congress determined that declaring and implementing code are
copyrightable, this factor alone cannot support a finding of fair use.

 

The majority, however, uses this factor to create a distinction between
declaring and implementing code that in effect removes copyright
protection from declaring code. It concludes that, unlike implementing
code, declaring code is far "from the core of copyright" because it
becomes valuable only when third parties (computer programmers) value it
and because it is "inherently bound together with uncopyrightable
ideas." *Ante*, at 1202 -- 1203.

 

Congress, however, rejected this sort of categorical distinction that
would make declaring code less worthy of protection. The Copyright Act
protects code that operates "in a computer in order to bring about a
certain result" both "directly" (implementing code) and "indirectly"
(declaring code). [§ 101](). And if anything, declaring code is *closer*
to the "core of copyright." *Ante*, at 1202 -- 1203. Developers cannot
even see implementing code. [*Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc.*, 2016 WL
3181206, \*4 (ND Cal., June 8, 2016)](); see also *ante*, at 1201 --
1202 (declaring code is "user-centered"). Implementing code thus conveys
*no* expression to developers. Declaring code, in contrast, is user
facing. It must be designed and organized in a way that is intuitive and
understandable to developers so that they can invoke it.

 

Even setting those concerns aside, the majority\'s distinction is
untenable. True, declaring code is "inherently bound together with
uncopyrightable ideas." *Ante,* at 1201 -- 1203. Is anything not? Books
are inherently bound with uncopyrightable ideas---the use of chapters,
having a plot, or including dialogue or footnotes. This does not place
books far "from the core of copyright." And implementing code, which the
majority concedes is copyrightable, is inherently **\*52** bound up with
"the division of computing tasks" that cannot be
copyrighted.[]{#co_fnRef_B00072053376261_ID0EYLDK_1
.anchor}[^6^](#co_footnote_B00072053376261_1) *Ante*, at 1201. We have
not discounted **\*\*1216** a work of authorship simply because it is
associated with noncopyrightable ideas. While ideas cannot be
copyrighted, expressions of those ideas can. [*Golan*, 565 U.S., at 328,
132 S.Ct. 873]().

 

Similarly, it makes no difference that the value of declaring code
depends on how much time third parties invest in learning it. Many other
copyrighted works depend on the same. A Broadway musical script needs
actors and singers to invest time learning and rehearsing it. But a
theater cannot copy a script---the rights to which are held by a smaller
theater---simply because it wants to entice actors to switch theaters
and because copying the script is more efficient than requiring the
actors to learn a new one.

 

What the majority says is true of declaring code is no less true of
implementing code. Declaring code is how programmers access prewritten
implementing code. The value of that implementing code thus is directly
proportional to how much programmers value the associated declaring
code. The majority correctly recognizes that declaring code "is
inextricably bound up with implementing code," *ante*, at 1201 -- 1202,
but it overlooks the implications of its own conclusion.

 

Only after wrongly concluding that the nature of declaring code makes
that code generally unworthy of protection does the Court move on to
consider the other factors. This opening mistake taints the Court\'s
entire analysis.

 

B. Market Effects

"\[U\]ndoubtedly the single most important element of fair use" is the
effect of Google\'s copying " 'upon the potential **\*53** market for or
value of \[Oracle\'s\] copyrighted work.' " [*Harper & Row, Publishers,
Inc. v. Nation Enterprises*, 471 U.S. 539, 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85
L.Ed.2d 588 (1985)](). As the Federal Circuit correctly determined,
"evidence of actual and potential harm stemming from Google\'s copying
was 'overwhelming.' " [886 F.3d 1179, 1209 (2018)](). By copying
Oracle\'s code to develop and release Android, Google ruined Oracle\'s
potential market in at least two ways.

 

First, Google eliminated the reason manufacturers were willing to pay to
install the Java platform. Google\'s business model differed from
Oracle\'s. While Oracle earned revenue by charging device manufacturers
to install the Java platform, Google obtained revenue primarily through
ad sales. Its strategy was to release Android to device manufacturers
for free and then use Android as a vehicle to collect data on consumers
and deliver behavioral ads. With a free product available that included
much of Oracle\'s code (and thus with similar programming potential),
device manufacturers no longer saw much reason to pay to embed the Java
platform.

 

For example, before Google released Android, Amazon paid for a license
to embed the Java platform in Kindle devices. But after Google released
Android, Amazon used the cost-free availability of Android to negotiate
a 97.5% discount on its license fee with Oracle. Evidence at trial
similarly showed that right after Google released Android, Samsung\'s
contract with Oracle dropped from \$40 million to about \$1 million.
Google contests none of this except to say that Amazon used a different
Java platform, Java Micro Edition instead of Java Standard Edition. That
difference is inconsequential because the former was simply a smaller
subset of the latter. Google copied code found in both platforms. The
majority does not dispute---or even mention---this enormous harm.

 

Second, Google interfered with opportunities for Oracle to license the
Java platform **\*\*1217** to developers of smartphone operating
**\*54** systems. Before Google copied Oracle\'s code, nearly every
mobile phone on the market contained the Java platform. Oracle\'s code
was extraordinarily valuable to anybody who wanted to develop
smartphones, which explains why Google tried no fewer than four times to
license it. The majority\'s remark that Google also sought other
licenses from Oracle, *ante*, at 1207 -- 1208, does not change this
central fact. Both parties agreed that Oracle could enter Google\'s
current market by licensing its declaring code. But by copying the code
and releasing Android, Google eliminated Oracle\'s opportunity to
license its code for that use.

 

The majority writes off this harm by saying that the jury could have
found that Oracle might not have been able to enter the modern
smartphone market successfully.[]{#co_fnRef_B00082053376261_ID0EMXDK_1
.anchor}[^7^](#co_footnote_B00082053376261_1) *Ante*, at 1206 -- 1207.
But whether Oracle could itself enter that market is only half the
picture. We look at not only the potential market "that creators of
original works would in general develop" but also those potential
markets the copyright holder might "license others to develop."
[*Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 592, 114 S.Ct.
1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)](). A book author need not be able to
personally convert a book into a film so long as he can license someone
else to do so. That Oracle could have licensed its code for use in
Android is undisputed.

 

Unable to seriously dispute that Google\'s actions had a disastrous
effect on Oracle\'s potential market, the majority changes course and
asserts that enforcing copyright protection could harm the public by
giving Oracle the power to "limi\[t\] the future creativity" of programs
on Android. *Ante*, at 1208. But this case concerns only versions of
Android released through November 2014. Order in No. 3:10--cv--3561 (ND
Cal., Feb. 5, 2016), Doc. 1479, p. 2 (identifying versions through
Android Lollipop 5.0). Google has released **\*55** six major versions
since then. Only about 7.7% of active Android devices still run the
versions at issue.[]{#co_fnRef_B00092053376261_ID0EZ2DK_1
.anchor}[^8^](#co_footnote_B00092053376261_1) The majority\'s concern
about a lock-in effect might carry more weight if this suit concerned
versions of Android widely in use or that will be widely in use. It
makes little sense in a suit about versions that are close to obsolete.

 

The majority\'s concern about a lock-in effect also is speculation
belied by history. First, Oracle never had lock-in power. The majority
(again) overlooks that Apple and Microsoft created mobile operating
systems without using Oracle\'s declaring code. Second, Oracle always
made its declaring code freely available to programmers. There is little
reason to suspect Oracle might harm programmers by stopping now. And
third, the majority simply assumes that the jury, in a future suit over
current Android versions, would give Oracle control of Android instead
of just awarding damages or perpetual royalties.

 

If the majority is going to speculate about what Oracle *might* do, it
at least should consider what Google *has* done. The majority expresses
concern that Oracle might abuse its copyright protection (on outdated
Android versions) and " 'attempt to monopolize the market.' " *Ante*, at
1208 -- 1209. But it is Google that recently **\*\*1218** was fined a
record \$5 billion for abusing Android to violate antitrust laws. Case
AT.40099, *Google Android*, July 18, 2018 (Eur. Comm\'n-Competition);
European Comm\'n Press Release, Commission Fines Google €4.34 Billion
for Illegal Practices Regarding Android Mobile Devices to Strengthen
Dominance of Google\'s Search Engine, July 18, 2018. Google controls the
most widely used mobile operating system in the world. And if companies
may now freely copy libraries of declaring code whenever it is more
convenient than writing their own, others will likely hesitate to spend
the resources Oracle did to create intuitive, well-organized **\*56**
libraries that attract programmers and could compete with Android. If
the majority is worried about monopolization, it ought to consider
whether Google is the greater threat.

 

By copying Oracle\'s work, Google decimated Oracle\'s market and created
a mobile operating system now in over 2.5 billion actively used devices,
earning tens of billions of dollars every year. If these effects on
Oracle\'s potential market *favor* Google, something is very wrong with
our fair-use analysis.

 

C. The Purpose and Character of the Use

The second-most important factor---"the purpose and character of the
use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for
nonprofit educational purposes," [§ 107(1)]()---requires us to consider
whether use was "commercial" and whether it was "transformative."
[*Campbell*, 510 U.S., at 578--579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Both aspects
heavily favor Oracle.

 

Begin with the overwhelming commercial nature of Google\'s copying. In
2015 alone, the year before the fair-use trial, Google earned \$18
billion from Android. That number has no doubt dramatically increased as
Android has grown to dominate the global market
share.[]{#co_fnRef_B00102053376261_ID0ECCEK_1
.anchor}[^9^](#co_footnote_B00102053376261_1) On this scale, Google\'s
use of Oracle\'s declaring code weighs heavily---if not
decisively---against fair use.

 

The majority attempts to dismiss this overwhelming commercial use by
noting that commercial use does "not necessarily" **\*57** weigh against
fair use. *Ante*, at 1204. True enough. Commercial use sometimes can be
overcome by use that is sufficiently "transformative." [*Campbell*, 510
U.S., at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). But "we cannot ignore \[Google\'s\]
*intended purpose* of supplanting \[Oracle\'s\] commercially valuable"
platform with its own. [*Harper*, 471 U.S., at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218]()
(emphasis in original). Even if we could, we have never found fair use
for copying that reaches into the tens of billions of dollars and wrecks
the copyright holder\'s market.

 

Regardless, Google fares no better on transformative use. A court
generally cannot find fair use unless the copier\'s use is
transformative.[]{#co_fnRef_B00112053376261_ID0E3GEK_1
.anchor}[^10^](#co_footnote_B00112053376261_1) A work is
"transformative" **\*\*1219** if it "adds something new, with a further
purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression,
meaning, or message." [*Campbell*, 510 U.S., at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().
This question is "guided by the examples \[of fair use\] given in the
preamble to [§ 107]()." [*Id.*, at 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). Those
examples include: "criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching \...,
scholarship, or research." [§ 107](). Although these examples are not
exclusive, they are illustrative, and Google\'s repurposing of Java code
from larger computers to smaller computers resembles none of them.
Google did not use Oracle\'s code to teach or reverse engineer a system
to ensure compatibility. Instead, to "avoid the drudgery in working up
something fresh," [*id*., at 580, 114 S.Ct. 1164](), Google used the
declaring code for the same exact purpose Oracle did. As the Federal
Circuit correctly determined, "\[t\]here is nothing fair about taking a
copyrighted work verbatim and using it for the same purpose and function
as the original in a competing platform." [886 F.3d at 1210]().

 

The majority acknowledges that Google used the copied declaring code
"for the same reason" Oracle did. **\*58** *Ante*, at 1203. So, by
turns, the majority transforms the definition of "transformative." Now,
we are told, "transformative" simply means---at least for computer
code---a use that will help others "create new products." *Ibid;*
accord, *ante*, at 1203 (Google\'s copying "can further the development
of computer programs").

 

That new definition eviscerates copyright. A movie studio that converts
a book into a film without permission not only creates a new product
(the film) but enables others to "create products"---film reviews,
merchandise, YouTube highlight reels, late night television interviews,
and the like. Nearly every computer program, once copied, can be used to
create new products. Surely the majority would not say that an author
can pirate the next version of Microsoft Word simply because he can use
it to create new manuscripts.[]{#co_fnRef_B00122053376261_ID0EUREK_1
.anchor}[^11^](#co_footnote_B00122053376261_1)

 

Ultimately, the majority wrongly conflates transformative use with
derivative use. To be transformative, a work must do something
fundamentally different from the original. A work that simply serves the
same purpose in a new context---which the majority concedes is true
here---is derivative, not transformative. Congress made clear that
Oracle holds "the exclusive rights \... to prepare derivative works." [§
106(2)](). Rather than create a transformative product, Google
"profit\[ed\] from exploitation of the copyrighted material without
paying the customary price." [*Harper*, 471 U.S., at 562, 105 S.Ct.
2218]().

 

D. The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

The statutory fair-use factors also instruct us to consider "the amount
and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole." [§ 107(3)](). In general, the greater the amount of
use, the more likely the copying is unfair. *Ibid.* But even if the
copier takes only a **\*59** small amount, copying the " 'heart' " or
"focal points" of a work weighs against fair use, [*Harper*, 471 U.S.,
at 565--566, 105 S.Ct. 2218](), unless " 'no more was taken than
necessary' " for the copier to achieve transformative use, [*Campbell*,
510 U.S., at 589, 114 S.Ct. 1164]().

 

**\*\*1220** Google does not dispute the Federal Circuit\'s conclusion
that it copied the heart or focal points of Oracle\'s work. [886 F.3d at
1207](). The declaring code is what attracted programmers to the Java
platform and why Google was so interested in that code. And Google
copied that code "verbatim," which weighs against fair use. [*Harper*,
471 U.S., at 565, 105 S.Ct. 2218](). The majority does not disagree.
Instead, it concludes that Google took no more than necessary to create
new products. That analysis fails because Google\'s use is not
transformative. [*Campbell*, 510 U.S., at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164]()
(recognizing that this fourth factor "will harken back to the
\[purpose-and-character\] statutory facto\[r\]"). This factor thus
weighs against Google.

 

Even if Google\'s use were transformative, the majority is wrong to
conclude that Google copied only a small portion of the original work.
The majority points out that the 11,500 lines of declaring code---enough
to fill about 600 pages in an appendix, Tr. of Oral Arg. 57---were just
a fraction of the code in the Java platform. But the proper denominator
is *declaring code*, not all code. A copied work is quantitatively
substantial if it could "serve as a market substitute for the original"
work or "potentially licensed derivatives" of that work. [*Campbell*,
510 U.S., at 587, 114 S.Ct. 1164](). The declaring code is what
attracted programmers. And it is what made Android a "market substitute"
for "potentially licensed derivatives" of Oracle\'s Java platform.
Google\'s copying was both qualitatively and quantitatively substantial.

 

\* \* \*

 

In sum, three of the four statutory fair-use factors weigh decidedly
against Google. The nature of the copyrighted work---the sole factor
possibly favoring Google---cannot by **\*60** itself support a
determination of fair use because holding otherwise would improperly
override Congress' determination that declaring code is
copyrightable.[]{#co_fnRef_B00132053376261_ID0E25EK_1
.anchor}[^12^](#co_footnote_B00132053376261_1)

 

IV

The majority purports to save for another day the question whether
declaring code is copyrightable. The only apparent reason for doing so
is because the majority cannot square its fundamentally flawed fair-use
analysis with a finding that declaring code is copyrightable. The
majority has used fair use to eviscerate Congress' considered policy
judgment. I respectfully dissent.
