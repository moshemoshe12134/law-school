**Synopsis**

Copyright infringement action was brought arising out of magazine\'s
unauthorized publication of verbatim quotes from President Ford\'s
memoirs. The United States District Court, the Southern District of New
York, [557 F.Supp. 1067,]() entered judgment in favor of copyright
holders. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, [723
F.2d 195,]() reversed the District Court\'s finding of infringement,
holding that defendant magazine\'s act was sanctioned as a "fair use" of
the copyrighted material, and copyright holders petitioned for a writ of
certiorari. The Supreme Court, Justice [O\'Connor](), held that
magazine\'s unauthorized publication of verbatim quotes from essentially
the "heart" of unpublished presidential memoirs, which was intended to
supplant copyright holders\' commercially valuable right of first
publication, was not a "fair use" within meaning of Copyright Revision
Act.

 

Reversed and remanded.

 

Justice [Brennan]() filed dissenting opinion in which Justice [White]()
and Justice [Marshall]() joined.

In 1977, former President Ford contracted with petitioners to publish
his as yet unwritten memoirs. The agreement gave petitioners the
exclusive first serial right to license prepublication excerpts. Two
years later, as the memoirs were nearing completion, petitioners, as the
copyright holders, negotiated a prepublication licensing agreement with
Time Magazine under which Time agreed to pay \$25,000 (\$12,500 in
advance and the balance at publication) in exchange for the right to
excerpt 7,500 words from Mr. Ford\'s account of his pardon of former
President Nixon. Shortly before the Time article\'s scheduled release,
an unauthorized source provided The Nation Magazine with the unpublished
Ford manuscript. Working directly from this manuscript, an editor of The
Nation produced a 2,250-word article, at least 300 to 400 words of which
consisted of verbatim quotes of copyrighted expression taken from the
manuscript. It was timed to "scoop" the Time article. As a result of the
publication of The Nation\'s article, Time canceled its article and
refused to pay the remaining \$12,500 to petitioners. Petitioners then
brought suit in Federal District Court against respondent publishers of
The Nation, alleging, *inter alia,* violations of the Copyright Act
(Act). The District Court held that the Ford memoirs were protected by
copyright at the time of The Nation publication and that respondents\'
use of the copyrighted material constituted an infringement under the
Act, and the court awarded actual damages of \$12,500. The Court of
Appeals reversed, holding that The Nation\'s publication of the 300 to
400 words it identified as copyrightable expression was sanctioned as a
"fair use" of the copyrighted material under [§ 107]() of the Act.
[Section 107]() provides that notwithstanding the provisions of § 106
giving a copyright owner the exclusive right to reproduce the
copyrighted work and to prepare **\*\*2220** derivative works based on
the copyrighted work, the fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes
such as comment and news reporting is not an infringement of copyright.
[Section 107]() further provides that in determining whether the use was
fair the factors to be considered shall include: (1) the purpose and
character of the use; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the **\*540**
copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect on the potential market
for or value of the copyrighted work.

 

*Held:* The Nation\'s article was not a "fair use" sanctioned by [§
107](). Pp. 2221--2235.

 

\(a\) In using generous verbatim excerpts of Mr. Ford\'s unpublished
expression to lend authenticity to its account of the forthcoming
memoirs, The Nation effectively arrogated to itself the right of first
publication, an important marketable subsidiary right. Pp. 2223--2225.

 

\(b\) Though the right of first publication, like other rights
enumerated in § 106, is expressly made subject to the fair use
provisions of [§ 107](), fair use analysis must always be tailored to
the individual case. The nature of the interest at stake is highly
relevant to whether a given use is fair. The unpublished nature of a
work is a key, though not necessarily determinative, factor tending to
negate a defense of fair use. And under ordinary circumstances, the
author\'s right to control the first public appearance of his
undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use. Pp.
2225--2228.

 

\(c\) In view of the First Amendment\'s protections embodied in the
Act\'s distinction between copyrightable expression and uncopyrightable
facts and ideas, and the latitude for scholarship and comment
traditionally afforded by fair use, there is no warrant for expanding,
as respondents contend should be done, the fair use doctrine to what
amounts to a public figure exception to copyright. Whether verbatim
copying from a public figure\'s manuscript in a given case is or is not
fair must be judged according to the traditional equities of fair use.
Pp. 2228--2231.

 

\(d\) Taking into account the four factors enumerated in [§ 107]() as
especially relevant in determining fair use, leads to the conclusion
that the use in question here was not fair. (i) The fact that news
reporting was the general purpose of The Nation\'s use is simply one
factor. While The Nation had every right to be the first to publish the
information, it went beyond simply reporting uncopyrightable information
and actively sought to exploit the headline value of its infringement,
making a "news event" out of its unauthorized first publication. The
fact that the publication was commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a
separate factor tending to weigh against a finding of fair use. Fair use
presupposes good faith. The Nation\'s unauthorized use of the
undisseminated manuscript had not merely the incidental effect but the
*intended purpose* of supplanting the copyright holders\' commercially
valuable right of first publication. (ii) While there may be a greater
need to disseminate works of fact than works of fiction, The Nation\'s
taking of copyrighted expression exceeded that necessary to disseminate
the facts and infringed the copyright holders\' interests in
confidentiality and creative control over the first public appearance of
the work. (iii) Although the verbatim quotes **\*541** in question were
an insubstantial portion of the Ford manuscript, they qualitatively
embodied Mr. Ford\'s distinctive expression and played a key role in the
infringing article. (iv) As to the effect of The Nation\'s article on
the market for the copyrighted work, Time\'s cancellation of its
projected article and its refusal to pay \$12,500 were the direct effect
of the infringing publication. Once a copyright holder establishes a
causal connection between the infringement and loss of revenue, the
burden shifts to the infringer to show that the damage would have
occurred had there been no taking of copyrighted expression. Petitioners
established a prima facie case of actual damage that respondents failed
to rebut. More important, **\*\*2221** to negate a claim of fair use it
need only be shown that if the challenged use should become widespread,
it would adversely affect the *potential* market for the copyrighted
work. Here, The Nation\'s liberal use of verbatim excerpts posed
substantial potential for damage to the marketability of first
serialization rights in the copyrighted work. Pp. 2231 -- 2235.

**Opinion**

Justice O\'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case requires us to consider to what extent the "fair use"
provision of the Copyright Revision Act of 1976, (hereinafter **\*542**
the Copyright Act) [17 U.S.C. § 107](), sanctions the unauthorized use
of quotations from a public figure\'s unpublished manuscript. In March
1979, an undisclosed source provided The Nation Magazine with the
unpublished manuscript of "A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald
R. Ford." Working directly from the purloined manuscript, an editor of
The Nation produced a short piece entitled "The Ford Memoirs---Behind
the Nixon Pardon." The piece was timed to "scoop" an article scheduled
shortly to appear in Time Magazine. Time had agreed to purchase the
exclusive right to print prepublication excerpts from the copyright
holders, Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. (hereinafter Harper & Row), and
Reader\'s Digest Association, Inc. (hereinafter Reader\'s Digest). As a
result of The Nation article, Time canceled its agreement. Petitioners
brought a successful copyright action against The Nation. On appeal, the
Second Circuit reversed the lower court\'s finding of infringement,
holding that The Nation\'s act was sanctioned as a "fair use" of the
copyrighted material. We granted certiorari, [467 U.S. 1214, 104 S.Ct.
2655, 81 L.Ed.2d 362 (1984)](), and we now reverse.

 

I

In February 1977, shortly after leaving the White House, former
President Gerald R. Ford contracted with petitioners Harper & Row and
Reader\'s Digest, to publish his as yet unwritten memoirs. The memoirs
were to contain "significant hitherto unpublished material" concerning
the Watergate crisis, Mr. Ford\'s pardon of former President Nixon and
"Mr. Ford\'s reflections on this period of history, and the morality and
personalities involved." App. to Pet. for Cert. C--14---C--15. In
addition to the right to publish the Ford memoirs in book form, the
agreement gave petitioners the exclusive right to license prepublication
excerpts, known in the trade as "first serial rights." Two years later,
as the memoirs were nearing completion, petitioners negotiated a
prepublication licensing agreement with Time, a weekly news magazine.
Time agreed to pay \$25,000, \$12,500 in advance and an **\*543**
additional \$12,500 at publication, in exchange for the right to excerpt
7,500 words from Mr. Ford\'s account of the Nixon pardon. The issue
featuring the excerpts was timed to appear approximately one week before
shipment of the full length book version to bookstores. Exclusivity was
an important consideration; Harper & Row instituted procedures designed
to maintain the confidentiality of the manuscript, and Time retained the
right to renegotiate the second payment should the material appear in
print prior to its release of the excerpts.

 

Two to three weeks before the Time article\'s scheduled release, an
unidentified person secretly brought a copy of the Ford manuscript to
Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation, a political commentary magazine.
Mr. Navasky knew that his possession of the manuscript was not
authorized and that the manuscript must be returned quickly to his
"source" to avoid discovery. [557 F.Supp. 1067, 1069 (SDNY 1983)](). He
hastily put together what he believed was "a real hot news story"
composed of **\*\*2222** quotes, paraphrases, and facts drawn
exclusively from the manuscript. *Ibid.* Mr. Navasky attempted no
independent commentary, research or criticism, in part because of the
need for speed if he was to "make news" by "publish\[ing\] in advance of
publication of the Ford book." App. 416--417. The 2,250--word article,
reprinted in the Appendix to this opinion, appeared on April 3, 1979. As
a result of The Nation\'s article, Time canceled its piece and refused
to pay the remaining \$12,500.

 

Petitioners brought suit in the District Court for the Southern District
of New York, alleging conversion, tortious interference with contract,
and violations of the Copyright Act. After a 6-day bench trial, the
District Judge found that "A Time to Heal" was protected by copyright at
the time of The Nation publication and that respondents\' use of the
copyrighted material constituted an infringement under the Copyright
Act, §§ 106(1), (2), and (3), protecting respectively the right to
reproduce the work, the right to license preparation of derivative
works, and the right of first distribution of **\*544** the copyrighted
work to the public. App. to Pet. for Cert. C--29---C--30. The District
Court rejected respondents\' argument that The Nation\'s piece was a
"fair use" sanctioned by [§ 107]() of the Act. Though billed as "hot
news," the article contained no new facts. The magazine had "published
its article for profit," taking "the heart" of "a soon-to-be-published"
work. This unauthorized use "caused the *Time* agreement to be aborted
and thus diminished the value of the copyright." [557 F.Supp., at
1072.]() Although certain elements of the Ford memoirs, such as
historical facts and memoranda, were not *per se* copyrightable, the
District Court held that it was "the totality of these facts and
memoranda collected together with Ford\'s reflections that made them of
value to The Nation, \[and\] this \... totality \... is protected by the
copyright laws." [*Id.,* at 1072--1073.]() The court awarded actual
damages of \$12,500.

 

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.
The majority recognized that Mr. Ford\'s verbatim "reflections" were
original "expression" protected by copyright. But it held that the
District Court had erred in assuming the "coupling \[of these
reflections\] with uncopyrightable fact transformed that information
into a copyrighted 'totality.' " [723 F.2d 195, 205 (CA2 1983)](). The
majority noted that copyright attaches to expression, not facts or
ideas. It concluded that, to avoid granting a copyright monopoly over
the facts underlying history and news, " 'expression' \[in such works
must be confined\] to its barest elements---the ordering and choice of
the words themselves." [*Id.,* at 204.]() Thus similarities between the
original and the challenged work traceable to the copying or
paraphrasing of uncopyrightable material, such as historical facts,
memoranda and other public documents, and quoted remarks of third
parties, must be disregarded in evaluating whether the second author\'s
use was fair or infringing.

> "When the uncopyrighted material is stripped away, the article in *The
> Nation* contains, at most, approximately **\*545** 300 words that are
> copyrighted. These remaining paragraphs and scattered phrases are all
> verbatim quotations from the memoirs which had not appeared previously
> in other publications. They include a short segment of Ford\'s
> conversations with Henry Kissinger and several other individuals.
> Ford\'s impressionistic depictions of Nixon, ill with [phlebitis]()
> after the resignation and pardon, and of Nixon\'s character,
> constitute the major portion of this material. It is these parts of
> the magazine piece on which \[the court\] must focus in \[its\]
> examination of the question whether there was a 'fair use' of
> copyrighted matter." [*Id.,* at 206]().

Examining the four factors enumerated in [§ 107](), see *infra,* at
2224, n. 2, the majority found the purpose of the article was "news
reporting," the original work was essentially factual in nature, the 300
words appropriated were insubstantial in relation to the 2,250--word
piece, and the impact on the market for the original was minimal as
**\*\*2223** "the evidence \[did\] not support a finding that it was the
very limited use of expression *per se* which led to Time\'s decision
not to print the excerpt." The Nation\'s borrowing of verbatim
quotations merely "len\[t\] authenticity to this politically significant
material \... complementing the reporting of the facts." [723 F.2d, at
208.]() The Court of Appeals was especially influenced by the
"politically significant" nature of the subject matter and its
conviction that it is not "the purpose of the Copyright Act to impede
that harvest of knowledge so necessary to a democratic state" or "chill
the activities of the press by forbidding a circumscribed use of
copyrighted words." [*Id.,* at 197, 209.]()

 

II

We agree with the Court of Appeals that copyright is intended to
increase and not to impede the harvest of knowledge. But we believe the
Second Circuit gave insufficient deference to the scheme established by
the Copyright Act for **\*546** fostering the original works that
provide the seed and substance of this harvest. The rights conferred by
copyright are designed to assure contributors to the store of knowledge
a fair return for their labors. [*Twentieth Century Music Corp. v.
Aiken,* 422 U.S. 151, 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040, 2043, 45 L.Ed.2d 84 (1975)]().

> "The Congress shall have Power \... to Promote the Progress of Science
> and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and
> Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
> Discoveries."

As we noted last Term: "\[This\] limited grant is a means by which an
important public purpose may be achieved. It is intended to motivate the
creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special
reward, and to allow the public access to the products of their genius
after the limited period of exclusive control has expired." [*Sony Corp.
of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S. 417, 429, 104
S.Ct. 774, 782, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984)](). "The monopoly created by
copyright thus rewards the individual author in order to benefit the
public." [*Id.,* at 477, 104 S.Ct., at 807]() (dissenting opinion). This
principle applies equally to works of fiction and nonfiction. The book
at issue here, for example, was two years in the making, and began with
a contract giving the author\'s copyright to the publishers in exchange
for their services in producing and marketing the work. In preparing the
book, Mr. Ford drafted essays and word portraits of public figures and
participated in hundreds of taped interviews that were later distilled
to chronicle his personal viewpoint. It is evident that the monopoly
granted by copyright actively served its intended purpose of inducing
the creation of new material of potential historical value.

 

Section 106 of the Copyright Act confers a bundle of exclusive rights to
the owner of the copyright.[]{#co_fnRef_B00021985125844_ID0EURBG_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00021985125844_1) Under the Copyright
**\*547** Act, these rights---to publish, copy, and distribute the
author\'s work---vest in the author of an original work from the time of
its creation. § 106. In practice, the author commonly sells his rights
to publishers who offer royalties in exchange for their services in
producing and marketing the author\'s work. The copyright owner\'s
rights, however, are subject to certain statutory exceptions. [§§
107]()--[118](). Among these is [§ 107]() which codifies the traditional
privilege of other authors to make "fair use" of an earlier writer\'s
work.[]{#co_fnRef_B00031985125844_ID0ETTBG_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00031985125844_1) In addition, **\*\*2224**
no author may copyright facts or ideas. § 102. The copyright is limited
to those aspects of the work---termed "expression"---that display the
stamp of the author\'s originality.

 

Creation of a nonfiction work, even a compilation of pure fact, entails
originality. See, *e.g.,* [*Schroeder v. William Morrow & Co.,* 566 F.2d
3 (CA7 1977)]() (copyright in gardening directory); cf. [*Burrow-Giles
Lithographic Co. v. Sarony,* 111 U.S. 53, 58, 4 S.Ct. 279, 281, 28 L.Ed.
349 (1884)]() (originator of a photograph may claim copyright in his
work). The copyright holders of "A Time to Heal" complied with the
relevant statutory notice and registration **\*548** procedures. See §§
106, 401, 408; App. to Pet. for Cert. C--20. Thus there is no dispute
that the unpublished manuscript of "A Time to Heal," as a whole, was
protected by § 106 from unauthorized reproduction. Nor do respondents
dispute that verbatim copying of excerpts of the manuscript\'s original
form of expression would constitute infringement unless excused as fair
use. See 1 M. Nimmer, Copyright § 2.11\[B\], p. 2--159 (1984)
(hereinafter Nimmer). Yet copyright does not prevent subsequent users
from copying from a prior author\'s work those constituent elements that
are not original---for example, quotations borrowed under the rubric of
fair use from other copyrighted works, facts, or materials in the public
domain---as long as such use does not unfairly appropriate the author\'s
original contributions. *Ibid.;* A. Latman, Fair Use of Copyrighted
Works (1958), reprinted as Study No. 14 in Copyright Law Revision
Studies Nos. 14--16, prepared for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
86th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1960) (hereinafter Latman). Perhaps the
controversy between the lower courts in this case over copyrightability
is more aptly styled a dispute over whether The Nation\'s appropriation
of unoriginal and uncopyrightable elements encroached on the originality
embodied in the work as a whole. Especially in the realm of factual
narrative, the law is currently unsettled regarding the ways in which
uncopyrightable elements combine with the author\'s original
contributions to form protected expression. Compare [*Wainwright
Securities Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript Corp.,* 558 F.2d 91 (CA2
1977)]() (protection accorded author\'s analysis, structuring of
material and marshaling of facts), with [*Hoehling v. Universal City
Studios, Inc.,* 618 F.2d 972 (CA2 1980)]() (limiting protection to
ordering and choice of words). See, *e.g.,* 1 Nimmer § 2.11\[D\], at
2--164---2--165.

 

We need not reach these issues, however, as The Nation has admitted to
lifting verbatim quotes of the author\'s original language totaling
between 300 and 400 words and constituting some 13% of The Nation
article. In using generous **\*549** verbatim excerpts of Mr. Ford\'s
unpublished manuscript to lend authenticity to its account of the
forthcoming memoirs, The Nation effectively arrogated to itself the
right of first publication, an important marketable subsidiary right.
For the reasons set forth below, we find that this use of the
copyrighted manuscript, even stripped to the verbatim quotes conceded by
The Nation to be copyrightable expression, was not a fair use within the
meaning of the Copyright Act.

 

III

A

Fair use was traditionally defined as "a privilege in others than the
owner of the copyright to use the copyrighted material in a reasonable
manner without his consent." H. Ball, Law of Copyright and Literary
**\*\*2225** Property 260 (1944) (hereinafter Ball). The statutory
formulation of the defense of fair use in the Copyright Act reflects the
intent of Congress to codify the common-law doctrine. 3 Nimmer § 13.05.
[Section 107]() requires a case-by-case determination whether a
particular use is fair, and the statute notes four nonexclusive factors
to be considered. This approach was "intended to restate the
\[pre-existing\] judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow,
or enlarge it in any way." [H.R.Rep. No. 94--1476, p. 66 (1976)]()
(hereinafter House Report), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, pp. 5659,
5680.

 

"\[T\]he author\'s consent to a reasonable use of his copyrighted works
ha\[d\] always been implied by the courts as a necessary incident of the
constitutional policy of promoting the progress of science and the
useful arts, since a prohibition of such use would inhibit subsequent
writers from attempting to improve upon prior works and thus \...
frustrate the very ends sought to be attained." Ball 260. Professor
Latman, in a study of the doctrine of fair use commissioned by Congress
for the revision effort, see [*Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City
Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S., at 462--463, n. 9, 104 S.Ct., at 781, n. 9]()
(dissenting opinion), summarized prior law as turning on the "importance
**\*550** of the material copied or performed from the point of view of
the reasonable copyright owner. In other words, would the reasonable
copyright owner have consented to the use?" Latman
15.[]{#co_fnRef_B00041985125844_ID0ECFAI_1
.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00041985125844_1)

 

As early as 1841, Justice Story gave judicial recognition to the
doctrine in a case that concerned the letters of another former
President, George Washington.

> "\[A\] reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his
> design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of
> fair and reasonable criticism. On the other hand, it is as clear, that
> if he thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view,
> not to criticise, but to supersede the use of the original work, and
> substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a
> piracy." [*Folsom v. Marsh,* 9 F.Cas. 342, 344--345 (No. 4,901)]() (CC
> Mass.)

As Justice Story\'s hypothetical illustrates, the fair use doctrine has
always precluded a use that "supersede\[s\] the use of the original."
*Ibid.* Accord, S.Rep. No. 94--473, p. 65 (1975) (hereinafter Senate
Report).

 

Perhaps because the fair use doctrine was predicated on the author\'s
implied consent to "reasonable and customary" use when he released his
work for public consumption, fair use traditionally was not recognized
as a defense to charges **\*551** of copying from an author\'s as yet
unpublished works.[]{#co_fnRef_B00051985125844_ID0EELAI_1
.anchor}[^4^](#co_footnote_B00051985125844_1) Under common-law
copyright, "the property of the author \... in his intellectual creation
\[was\] absolute until he voluntarily part\[ed\] with the same."
**\*\*2226** [*American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister,* 207 U.S. 284, 299,
28 S.Ct. 72, 77, 52 L.Ed. 208 (1907)](); 2 Nimmer § 8.23, at 8--273.
This absolute rule, however, was tempered in practice by the equitable
nature of the fair use doctrine. In a given case, factors such as
implied consent through *de facto* publication on performance or
dissemination of a work may tip the balance of equities in favor of
prepublication use. See Copyright Law Revision---Part 2: Discussion and
Comments on Report of the Register of Copyrights on General Revision of
the U.S. Copyright Law, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 27 (H.R.Comm. Print 1963)
(discussion suggesting works disseminated to the public in a form not
constituting a technical "publication" should nevertheless be subject to
fair use); 3 Nimmer § 13.05, at 13--62, n. 2. But it has never been
seriously disputed that "the fact that the plaintiff\'s work is
unpublished \... is a factor tending to negate the defense of fair use."
*Ibid.* Publication of an author\'s expression before he has authorized
its dissemination seriously infringes the author\'s right to decide when
and whether it will be made public, a factor not present in fair use of
published works.[]{#co_fnRef_B00061985125844_ID0EZNAI_1
.anchor}[^5^](#co_footnote_B00061985125844_1) **\*552** Respondents
contend, however, that Congress, in including first publication among
the rights enumerated in § 106, which are expressly subject to fair use
under [§ 107](), intended that fair use would apply *in pari materia* to
published and unpublished works. The Copyright Act does not support this
proposition.

 

The Copyright Act represents the culmination of a major legislative
reexamination of copyright doctrine. See [*Mills Music, Inc. v. Snyder,*
469 U.S. 153, 159--160, 105 S.Ct. 638, at --------, 83 L.Ed.2d 556
(1985)](); [*Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,* 464
U.S., at 462--463, n. 9, 104 S.Ct., at 781, n. 9]() (dissenting
opinion). Among its other innovations, it eliminated publication "as a
dividing line between common law and statutory protection," House
Report, at 129 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, p. 5745, extending
statutory protection to all works from the time of their creation. It
also recognized for the first time a distinct statutory right of first
publication, which had previously been an element of the common-law
protections afforded unpublished works. The Report of the House
Committee on the Judiciary confirms that "Clause (3) of section 106,
establishes the exclusive right of publications\.... Under this
provision the copyright owner would have the right to control the first
public distribution of an authorized copy \... of his work." *Id.,* at
62 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, p. 5675.

 

[**^\[1\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F11985125844_1) Though the right of first
publication, like the other rights enumerated in § 106, is expressly
made subject to the fair use provision of [§ 107](), fair use analysis
must always be tailored to the individual case. *Id.,* at 65; 3 Nimmer §
13.05\[A\]. The **\*553** nature of the interest at stake is highly
relevant to whether a given use is fair. From the beginning, those
entrusted with the task of revision recognized the "overbalancing
reasons to preserve the common law protection of undisseminated works
until the author or his successor chooses to disclose them." Copyright
Law Revision, Report of the Register of Copyrights on the General
Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 41 (Comm.
Print 1961). The right of first **\*\*2227** publication implicates a
threshold decision by the author whether and in what form to release his
work. First publication is inherently different from other § 106 rights
in that only one person can be the first publisher; as the contract with
Time illustrates, the commercial value of the right lies primarily in
exclusivity. Because the potential damage to the author from judicially
enforced "sharing" of the first publication right with unauthorized
users of his manuscript is substantial, the balance of equities in
evaluating such a claim of fair use inevitably shifts.

 

The Senate Report confirms that Congress intended the unpublished nature
of the work to figure prominently in fair use analysis. In discussing
fair use of photocopied materials in the classroom the Committee Report
states:

> "A key, though not necessarily determinative, factor in fair use is
> whether or not the work is available to the potential user. If the
> work is 'out of print' and unavailable for purchase through normal
> channels, the user may have more justification for reproducing it\....
> The applicability of the fair use doctrine to unpublished works is
> narrowly limited since, although the work is unavailable, this is the
> result of a deliberate choice on the part of the copyright owner.
> Under ordinary circumstances, the copyright owner\'s 'right of first
> publication' would outweigh any needs of reproduction for classroom
> purposes." Senate Report, at 64.

Although the Committee selected photocopying of classroom materials to
illustrate fair use, it emphasized that "the same **\*554** general
standards of fair use are applicable to all kinds of uses of copyrighted
material." *Id.,* at 65. We find unconvincing respondents\' contention
that the absence of the quoted passage from the House Report indicates
an intent to abandon the traditional distinction between fair use of
published and unpublished works. It appears instead that the fair use
discussion of photocopying of classroom materials was omitted from the
final Report because educators and publishers in the interim had
negotiated a set of guidelines that rendered the discussion obsolete.
House Report, at 67. The House Report nevertheless incorporates the
discussion by reference, citing to the Senate Report and stating: "The
Committee has reviewed this discussion, and considers it still has value
as an analysis of various aspects of the \[fair use\] problem." *Ibid.*

 

Even if the legislative history were entirely silent, we would be bound
to conclude from Congress\' characterization of [§ 107]() as a
"restatement" that its effect was to preserve existing law concerning
fair use of unpublished works as of other types of protected works and
not to "change, narrow, or enlarge it." *Id.,* at 66. We conclude that
the unpublished nature of a work is "\[a\] key, though not necessarily
determinative, factor" tending to negate a defense of fair use. Senate
Report, at 64. See 3 Nimmer § 13.05, at 13--62, n. 2; W. Patry, The Fair
Use Privilege in Copyright Law 125 (1985) (hereinafter Patry).

 

[**^\[2\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F21985125844_1) We also find unpersuasive
respondents\' argument that fair use may be made of a
soon-to-be-published manuscript on the ground that the author has
demonstrated he has no interest in nonpublication. This argument assumes
that the unpublished nature of copyrighted material is only relevant to
letters or other confidential writings not intended for dissemination.
It is true that common-law copyright was often enlisted in the service
of personal privacy. See [Brandeis & Warren, The Right to Privacy, 4
Harv.L.Rev. 193, 198--199 (1890)](). In its commercial guise, however,
an author\'s right to choose when he will publish is no less deserving
of protection. **\*555** The period encompassing the work\'s initiation,
its preparation, and its grooming for public dissemination is a crucial
one for any literary endeavor. The Copyright Act, which accords the
copyright owner the "right to control the first public distribution" of
his work, House Report, at 62, echos the common law\'s concern that the
author or copyright owner retain control throughout this **\*\*2228**
critical stage. See generally Comment, [The Stage of Publication as a
"Fair Use" Factor: *Harper & Row, Publishers v. Nation Enterprises,* 58
St. John\'s L.Rev. 597 (1984)](). The obvious benefit to author and
public alike of assuring authors the leisure to develop their ideas free
from fear of expropriation outweighs any short-term "news value" to be
gained from premature publication of the author\'s expression. See
[Goldstein, Copyright and the First Amendment, 70 Colum.L.Rev. 983,
1004--1006 (1970)]() (The absolute protection the common law accorded to
soon-to-be published works "\[was\] justified by \[its\] brevity and
expedience"). The author\'s control of first public distribution
implicates not only his personal interest in creative control but his
property interest in exploitation of prepublication rights, which are
valuable in themselves and serve as a valuable adjunct to publicity and
marketing. See [*Belushi v. Woodward,* 598 F.Supp. 36 (DC 1984)]()
(successful marketing depends on coordination of serialization and
release to public); Marks, Subsidiary Rights and Permissions, in What
Happens in Book Publishing 230 (C. Grannis ed. 1967) (exploitation of
subsidiary rights is necessary to financial success of new books). Under
ordinary circumstances, the author\'s right to control the first public
appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of
fair use.

 

B

[**^\[3\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F31985125844_1) Respondents, however,
contend that First Amendment values require a different rule under the
circumstances of this case. The thrust of the decision below is that
"\[t\]he scope of \[fair use\] is undoubtedly wider when the information
**\*556** conveyed relates to matters of high public concern."
[*Consumers Union of the United States, Inc. v. General Signal Corp.,*
724 F.2d 1044, 1050 (CA2 1983)]() (construing [723 F.2d 195 (CA2
1983)]() (case below) as allowing advertiser to quote Consumer Reports),
cert. denied, 469 U.S. 823, 104 S.Ct. 2655, 81 L.Ed.2d 362 (1984).
Respondents advance the substantial public import of the subject matter
of the Ford memoirs as grounds for excusing a use that would ordinarily
not pass muster as a fair use---the piracy of verbatim quotations for
the purpose of "scooping" the authorized first serialization.
Respondents explain their copying of Mr. Ford\'s expression as essential
to reporting the news story it claims the book itself represents. In
respondents\' view, not only the facts contained in Mr. Ford\'s memoirs,
but "the precise manner in which \[he\] expressed himself \[were\] as
newsworthy as what he had to say." Brief for Respondents 38--39.
Respondents argue that the public\'s interest in learning this news as
fast as possible outweighs the right of the author to control its first
publication.

 

The Second Circuit noted, correctly, that copyright\'s idea/expression
dichotomy "strike\[s\] a definitional balance between the First
Amendment and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of
facts while still protecting an author\'s expression." [723 F.2d, at
203.]() No author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates. [17
U.S.C. § 102(b)](). See, *e.g.,* [*New York Times Co. v. United States,*
403 U.S. 713, 726,]() n. , [91 S.Ct. 2140, 2147,]() n. , [29 L.Ed.2d 822
(1971)]() (BRENNAN, J., concurring) (Copyright laws are not restrictions
on freedom of speech as copyright protects only form of expression and
not the ideas expressed); 1 Nimmer § 1.10\[B\]\[2\]. As this Court long
ago observed: "\[T\]he news element---the information respecting current
events contained in the literary production---is not the creation of the
writer, but is a report of matters that ordinarily are *publici juris;*
it is the history of the day." [*International News Service v.
Associated Press,* 248 U.S. 215, 234, 39 S.Ct. 68, 71, 63 L.Ed. 211
(1918)](). But copyright assures those who write and publish factual
narratives such as "A Time to Heal" that **\*557** they may at least
enjoy the right to market the original expression contained therein as
just compensation for their investment. Cf. **\*\*2229** [*Zacchini v.
Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.,* 433 U.S. 562, 575, 97 S.Ct. 2849,
2857, 53 L.Ed.2d 965 (1977)]().

 

Respondents\' theory, however, would expand fair use to effectively
destroy any expectation of copyright protection in the work of a public
figure. Absent such protection, there would be little incentive to
create or profit in financing such memoirs, and the public would be
denied an important source of significant historical information. The
promise of copyright would be an empty one if it could be avoided merely
by dubbing the infringement a fair use "news report" of the book. See
[*Wainwright Securities Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript Corp.,* 558 F.2d
91 (CA2 1977)](), cert. denied, [434 U.S. 1014, 98 S.Ct 730, 54 L.Ed.2d
759 (1978)]().

 

Nor do respondents assert any actual necessity for circumventing the
copyright scheme with respect to the types of works and users at issue
here.[]{#co_fnRef_B00071985125844_ID0EOQBI_1
.anchor}[^6^](#co_footnote_B00071985125844_1) Where an author and
publisher have invested extensive resources in creating an original work
and are poised to release it to the public, no legitimate aim is served
by pre-empting the right of first publication. The fact that the words
the author has chosen to clothe his narrative may of themselves be
"newsworthy" is not an independent justification for unauthorized
copying of the author\'s expression prior to publication. To paraphrase
another recent Second Circuit decision:

 

> "\[Respondent\] possessed an unfettered right to use any factual
> information revealed in \[the memoirs\] for the purpose of
> enlightening its audience, but it can claim **\*558** no need to
> 'bodily appropriate' \[Mr. Ford\'s\] 'expression' of that information
> by utilizing portions of the actual \[manuscript\]. The public
> interest in the free flow of information is assured by the law\'s
> refusal to recognize a valid copyright in facts. The fair use doctrine
> is not a license for corporate theft, empowering a court to ignore a
> copyright whenever it determines the underlying work contains material
> of possible public importance." [*Iowa State University Research
> Foundation, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., Inc.,* 621 F.2d 57, 61
> (CA2 1980)]() (citations omitted).

Accord, [*Roy Export Co. Establishment v. Columbia Broadcasting System,
Inc.,* 503 F.Supp. 1137 (SDNY 1980)]() ("newsworthiness" of material
copied does not justify copying), aff\'d, [672 F.2d 1095 (CA2),]() cert.
denied, [459 U.S. 826, 103 S.Ct. 60, 74 L.Ed.2d 63 (1982)](); [*Quinto
v. Legal Times of Washington, Inc.,* 506 F.Supp. 554 (DC 1981)]()
(same).

In our haste to disseminate news, it should not be forgotten that the
Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression.
By establishing a marketable right to the use of one\'s expression,
copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate
ideas. This Court stated in [*Mazer v. Stein,* 347 U.S. 201, 219, 74
S.Ct. 460, 471, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954)]():

> "The economic philosophy behind the clause empowering Congress to
> grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of
> individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public
> welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in 'Science and
> useful Arts.' "

And again in *Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken:*

> "The immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return
> for an 'author\'s\' creative labor. But the ultimate aim is, by this
> incentive, to stimulate \[the creation of useful works\] for the
> general public good." [422 U.S., at 156, 95 S.Ct., at 2043]().

 

**\*559** It is fundamentally at odds with the scheme of copyright to
accord lesser rights **\*\*2230** in those works that are of greatest
importance to the public. Such a notion ignores the major premise of
copyright and injures author and public alike. "\[T\]o propose that fair
use be imposed whenever the 'social value \[of dissemination\] \...
outweighs any detriment to the artist,' would be to propose depriving
copyright owners of their right in the property precisely when they
encounter those users who could afford to pay for it." Gordon, [Fair Use
as Market Failure: A Structural and Economic Analysis of the *Betamax*
Case and its Predecessors, 82 Colum.L.Rev. 1600, 1615 (1982)](). And as
one commentator has noted: "If every volume that was in the public
interest could be pirated away by a competing publisher, \... the public
\[soon\] would have nothing worth reading." Sobel, Copyright and the
First Amendment: A Gathering Storm?, 19 ASCAP Copyright Law Symposium
43, 78 (1971). See generally Comment, [Copyright and the First
Amendment; Where Lies the Public Interest?, 59 Tulane L.Rev. 135
(1984)]().

 

Moreover, freedom of thought and expression "includes both the right to
speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all." [*Wooley v.
Maynard,* 430 U.S. 705, 714, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 1435, 51 L.Ed.2d 752
(1977)]() (BURGER, C.J.). We do not suggest this right not to speak
would sanction abuse of the copyright owner\'s monopoly as an instrument
to suppress facts. But in the words of New York\'s Chief Judge Fuld:

> "The essential thrust of the First Amendment is to prohibit improper
> restraints on the *voluntary* public expression of ideas; it shields
> the man who wants to speak or publish when others wish him to be
> quiet. There is necessarily, and within suitably defined areas, a
> concomitant freedom *not* to speak publicly, one which serves the same
> ultimate end as freedom of speech in its affirmative aspect." [*Estate
> of Hemingway v. Random House, Inc.,* 23 N.Y.2d 341, 348, 296 N.Y.S.2d
> 771, 776, 244 N.E.2d 250, 255 (1968)]().

**\*560** Courts and commentators have recognized that copyright, and
the right of first publication in particular, serve this countervailing
First Amendment value. See [*Schnapper v. Foley,* 215 U.S.App.D.C. 59,
667 F.2d 102 (1981)](), cert. denied, [455 U.S. 948, 102 S.Ct. 1448, 71
L.Ed.2d 661 (1982)](); 1 Nimmer § 1.10\[B\], at 1--70, n. 24; Patry
140--142.

 

In view of the First Amendment protections already embodied in the
Copyright Act\'s distinction between copyrightable expression and
uncopyrightable facts and ideas, and the latitude for scholarship and
comment traditionally afforded by fair use, we see no warrant for
expanding the doctrine of fair use to create what amounts to a public
figure exception to copyright. Whether verbatim copying from a public
figure\'s manuscript in a given case is or is not fair must be judged
according to the traditional equities of fair use.

[**^\[4\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F41985125844_1)
[**^\[5\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F51985125844_1)
[**^\[6\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F61985125844_1) Fair use is a mixed question
of law and fact. [*Pacific & Southern Co. v. Duncan,* 744 F.2d 1490,
1495, n. 8 (CA11 1984)](). Where the district court has found facts
sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors, an appellate court
"need not remand for further factfinding \... \[but\] may conclude as a
matter of law that \[the challenged use\] do\[es\] not qualify as a fair
use of the copyrighted work." [*Id.,* at 1495.]() Thus whether The
Nation article constitutes fair use under [§ 107]() must be reviewed in
light of the principles discussed above. The factors enumerated in the
section are not meant to be exclusive: "\[S\]ince the doctrine is an
equitable rule of reason, no generally applicable definition is
possible, and each case raising the question must be decided on its own
facts." House Report, at 65, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, p. 5678.
The four factors identified by Congress as especially relevant in
determining whether the use was fair are: (1) the purpose and character
of the use; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as **\*561** a whole; (4) the effect on the potential market
**\*\*2231** for or value of the copyrighted work. We address each one
separately.

 

[**^\[7\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F71985125844_1) *Purpose of the Use.* The
Second Circuit correctly identified news reporting as the general
purpose of The Nation\'s use. News reporting is one of the examples
enumerated in [§ 107]() to "give some idea of the sort of activities the
courts might regard as fair use under the circumstances." Senate Report,
at 61. This listing was not intended to be exhaustive, see *ibid.;* §
101 (definition of "including" and "such as"), or to single out any
particular use as presumptively a "fair" use. The drafters resisted
pressures from special interest groups to create presumptive categories
of fair use, but structured the provision as an affirmative defense
requiring a case-by-case analysis. See H.R.Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st
Sess., 37 (1967); Patry 477, n. 4. "\[W\]hether a use referred to in the
first sentence of [section 107]() is a fair use in a particular case
will depend upon the application of the determinative factors, including
those mentioned in the second sentence." Senate Report, at 62. The fact
that an article arguably is "news" and therefore a productive use is
simply one factor in a fair use analysis.

 

We agree with the Second Circuit that the trial court erred in fixing on
whether the information contained in the memoirs was actually new to the
public. As Judge Meskill wisely noted, "\[c\]ourts should be chary of
deciding what is and what is not news." [723 F.2d, at 215]()
(dissenting). Cf. [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,* 418 U.S. 323,
345--346, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3009--3010, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974)](). "The
issue is not what constitutes 'news,' but whether a claim of
newsreporting is a valid fair use defense to an infringement of
*copyrightable expression.*" Patry 119. The Nation has every right to
seek to be the first to publish information. But The Nation went beyond
simply reporting uncopyrightable information and actively sought to
exploit the headline value of its infringement, making a "news event"
out of its unauthorized first publication of a noted figure\'s
copyrighted expression.

 

**\*562** [**^\[8\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F81985125844_1) The fact that a
publication was commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor
that tends to weigh against a finding of fair use. "\[E\]very commercial
use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of
the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright."
[*Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S., at
451, 104 S.Ct., at 793.]() In arguing that the purpose of news reporting
is not purely commercial, The Nation misses the point entirely. The crux
of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of
the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from
exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary
price. See [*Roy Export Co. Establishment v. Columbia Broadcasting
System, Inc.,* 503 F.Supp., at 1144;]() 3 Nimmer § 13.05\[A\]\[1\], at
13--71, n. 25.3.

 

In evaluating character and purpose we cannot ignore The Nation\'s
stated purpose of scooping the forthcoming hardcover and Time
abstracts.[]{#co_fnRef_B00081985125844_ID0E6OCI_1
.anchor}[^7^](#co_footnote_B00081985125844_1) App. to Pet. for Cert.
C--27. The Nation\'s use had not merely the incidental effect but the
*intended purpose* of supplanting the copyright holder\'s commercially
valuable right of first publication. See [*Meredith Corp. v. Harper &
Row, Publishers, Inc.,* 378 F.Supp. 686, 690 (SDNY)]() (purpose of text
was to compete with original), aff\'d, [500 F.2d 1221 (CA2 1974)]().
Also relevant to the "character" of the use is "the propriety of the
defendant\'s **\*\*2232** conduct." 3 Nimmer § 13.05\[A\], at 13--72.
"Fair use presupposes 'good faith' and 'fair dealing.' " [*Time Inc. v.
Bernard Geis Associates,* 293 F.Supp. 130, 146 (SDNY 1968)](), quoting
**\*563** Schulman, Fair Use and the Revision of the Copyright Act, 53
Iowa L.Rev. 832 (1968). The trial court found that The Nation knowingly
exploited a purloined manuscript. App. to Pet. for Cert. B--1,
C--20---C--21, C--28---C--29. Unlike the typical claim of fair use, The
Nation cannot offer up even the fiction of consent as justification.
Like its competitor newsweekly, it was free to bid for the right of
abstracting excerpts from "A Time to Heal." Fair use "distinguishes
between 'a true scholar and a chiseler who infringes a work for personal
profit.' " [*Wainwright Securities Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript
Corp.,* 558 F.2d, at 94,]() quoting from Hearings on Bills for the
General Revision of the Copyright Law before the House Committee on the
Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 8, pt. 3, p. 1706 (1966)
(statement of John Schulman).

 

*Nature of the Copyrighted Work.* Second, the Act directs attention to
the nature of the copyrighted work. "A Time to Heal" may be
characterized as an unpublished historical narrative or autobiography.
The law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works
than works of fiction or fantasy. See Gorman, Fact or Fancy? The
Implications for Copyright, 29 J. Copyright Soc. 560, 561 (1982).

> "\[E\]ven within the field of fact works, there are gradations as to
> the relative proportion of fact and fancy. One may move from sparsely
> embellished maps and directories to elegantly written biography. The
> extent to which one must permit expressive language to be copied, in
> order to assure dissemination of the underlying facts, will thus vary
> from case to case." *Id.,* at 563.

Some of the briefer quotes from the memoirs are arguably necessary
adequately to convey the facts; for example, Mr. Ford\'s
characterization of the White House tapes as the "smoking gun" is
perhaps so integral to the idea expressed as to be inseparable from it.
Cf. 1 Nimmer § 1.10\[C\]. But The Nation did not stop at isolated
phrases and instead excerpted subjective descriptions and portraits of
public figures whose power lies in the author\'s individualized
expression. Such **\*564** use, focusing on the most expressive elements
of the work, exceeds that necessary to disseminate the facts.

 

[**^\[9\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F91985125844_1) The fact that a work is
unpublished is a critical element of its "nature." 3 Nimmer §
13.05\[A\]; Comment, [58 St. John\'s L.Rev., at 613.]() Our prior
discussion establishes that the scope of fair use is narrower with
respect to unpublished works. While even substantial quotations might
qualify as fair use in a review of a published work or a news account of
a speech that had been delivered to the public or disseminated to the
press, see House Report, at 65, the author\'s right to control the first
public appearance of his expression weighs against such use of the work
before its release. The right of first publication encompasses not only
the choice whether to publish at all, but also the choices of when,
where, and in what form first to publish a work.

 

In the case of Mr. Ford\'s manuscript, the copyright holders\' interest
in confidentiality is irrefutable; the copyright holders had entered
into a contractual undertaking to "keep the manuscript confidential" and
required that all those to whom the manuscript was shown also "sign an
agreement to keep the manuscript confidential." App. to Pet. for Cert.
C--19---C--20. While the copyright holders\' contract with Time required
Time to submit its proposed article seven days before publication, The
Nation\'s clandestine publication afforded no such opportunity for
creative or quality control. *Id.,* at C--18. It was hastily patched
together and contained "a number of inaccuracies." App. 300b--300c
(testimony of Victor Navasky). A use that so clearly infringes the
copyright holder\'s interests in confidentiality and creative control is
difficult to characterize as "fair."

 

**\*\*2233** *Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used.* Next, the
Act directs us to examine the amount and substantiality of the portion
used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole. In absolute terms,
the words actually quoted were an insubstantial portion of "A Time to
Heal." The District Court, however, found that "\[T\]he Nation took what
was **\*565** essentially the heart of the book." [557 F.Supp., at
1072.]() We believe the Court of Appeals erred in overruling the
District Judge\'s evaluation of the qualitative nature of the taking.
See, *e.*[*g., Roy Export Co. Establishment v. Columbia Broadcasting
System, Inc.,* 503 F.Supp., at 1145]() (taking of 55 seconds out of 1
hour and 29--minute film deemed qualitatively substantial). A Time
editor described the chapters on the pardon as "the most interesting and
moving parts of the entire manuscript." Reply Brief for Petitioners 16,
n. 8. The portions actually quoted were selected by Mr. Navasky as among
the most powerful passages in those chapters. He testified that he used
verbatim excerpts because simply reciting the information could not
adequately convey the "absolute certainty with which \[Ford\] expressed
himself," App. 303; or show that "this comes from President Ford,"
*id.,* at 305; or carry the "definitive quality" of the original, *id.,*
at 306. In short, he quoted these passages precisely because they
qualitatively embodied Ford\'s distinctive expression.

 

As the statutory language indicates, a taking may not be excused merely
because it is insubstantial with respect to the *infringing* work. As
Judge Learned Hand cogently remarked, "no plagiarist can excuse the
wrong by showing how much of his work he did not pirate." [*Sheldon v.
Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp.,* 81 F.2d 49, 56 (CA2),]() cert. denied,
[298 U.S. 669, 56 S.Ct. 835, 80 L.Ed. 1392 (1936)](). Conversely, the
fact that a substantial portion of the infringing work was copied
verbatim is evidence of the qualitative value of the copied material,
both to the originator and to the plagiarist who seeks to profit from
marketing someone else\'s copyrighted expression.

 

Stripped to the verbatim quotes,[]{#co_fnRef_B00091985125844_ID0EVBDI_1
.anchor}[^8^](#co_footnote_B00091985125844_1) the direct takings from
the unpublished manuscript constitute at least 13% of the
infringingarticle. **\*566** See [*Meeropol v. Nizer,* 560 F.2d 1061,
1071 (CA2 1977)]() (copyrighted letters constituted less than 1% of
infringing work but were prominently featured). The Nation article is
structured around the quoted excerpts which serve as its dramatic focal
points. See Appendix to this opinion, *post,* p. 2235. In view of the
expressive value of the excerpts and their key role in the infringing
work, we cannot agree with the Second Circuit that the "magazine took a
meager, indeed an infinitesimal amount of Ford\'s original language."
[723 F.2d, at 209]().

 

[**^\[10\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F101985125844_1)
[**^\[11\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F111985125844_1) *Effect on the Market.*
Finally, the Act focuses on "the effect of the use upon the potential
market for or value of the copyrighted work." This last factor is
undoubtedly the single most important element of fair
use.[]{#co_fnRef_B00101985125844_ID0EJGDI_1
.anchor}[^9^](#co_footnote_B00101985125844_1) See 3 Nimmer § 13.05\[A\],
**\*\*2234** at 13--76, and cases cited therein. "Fair use, when
properly applied, is limited to copying by others which **\*567** does
not materially impair the marketability of the work which is copied." 1
Nimmer § 1.10\[D\], at 1--87. The trial court found not merely a
potential but an actual effect on the market. Time\'s cancellation of
its projected serialization and its refusal to pay the \$12,500 were the
direct effect of the infringement. The Court of Appeals rejected this
factfinding as clearly erroneous, noting that the record did not
establish a causal relation between Time\'s nonperformance and
respondents\' unauthorized publication of Mr. Ford\'s *expression* as
opposed to the facts taken from the memoirs. We disagree. Rarely will a
case of copyright infringement present such clear-cut evidence of actual
damage. Petitioners assured Time that there would be no other authorized
publication of *any* portion of the unpublished manuscript prior to
April 23, 1979. *Any* publication of material from chapters 1 and 3
would permit Time to renegotiate its final payment. Time cited The
Nation\'s article, which contained verbatim quotes from the unpublished
manuscript, as a reason for its nonperformance. With respect to
apportionment of profits flowing from a copyright infringement, this
Court has held that an infringer who commingles infringing and
noninfringing elements "must abide the consequences, unless he can make
a separation of the profits so as to assure to the injured party all
that justly belongs to him." [*Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp.,*
309 U.S. 390, 406, 60 S.Ct. 681, 687, 84 L.Ed. 825 (1940)](). Cf. [17
U.S.C. § 504(b)]() (the infringer is required to prove elements of
profits attributable to other than the infringed work). Similarly, once
a copyright holder establishes with reasonable probability the existence
of a causal connection between the infringement and a loss of revenue,
the burden properly shifts to the infringer to show that this damage
would have occurred had there been no taking of copyrighted expression.
See 3 Nimmer § 14.02, at 14--7---14--8.1. Petitioners established a
prima facie case of actual damage that respondents failed to rebut. See
**\*568** [*Stevens Linen Associates,* *Inc. v. Mastercraft Corp.,* 656
F.2d 11, 15 (CA2 1981)](). The trial court properly awarded actual
damages and accounting of profits. See [17 U.S.C. § 504(b)]().

 

[**^\[12\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F121985125844_1) More important, to negate
fair use one need only show that if the challenged use "should become
widespread, it would adversely affect the *potential* market for the
copyrighted work." [*Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios,
Inc.,* 464 U.S., at 451, 104 S.Ct., at 793]() (emphasis added); [*id.,*
at 484, and n. 36, 104 S.Ct., at 810, and n. 36]() (collecting cases)
(dissenting opinion). This inquiry must take account not only of harm to
the original but also of harm to the market for derivative works. See
[*Iowa State University Research Foundation, Inc. v. American
Broadcasting Cos.,* 621 F.2d 57 (CA2 1980)](); *Meeropol v. Nizer,
supra,* at 1070; [*Roy Export v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,*
503 F.Supp., at 1146.]() "If the defendant\'s work adversely affects the
value of any of the rights in the copyrighted work (in this case the
adaptation \[and serialization\] right) the use is not fair." 3 Nimmer §
13.05\[B\], at 13--77---13--78 (footnote omitted).

 

It is undisputed that the factual material in the balance of The
Nation\'s article, besides the verbatim quotes at issue here, was drawn
exclusively from the chapters on the pardon. The excerpts were employed
as featured episodes in a story about the Nixon pardon---precisely the
use petitioners had licensed to Time. The borrowing of these verbatim
quotes from the unpublished manuscript lent The Nation\'s piece a
special air of authenticity---as Navasky expressed it, the reader would
know it was Ford speaking and not The Nation. **\*\*2235** App. 300c.
Thus it directly competed for a share of the market for prepublication
excerpts. The Senate Report states:

> "With certain special exceptions \... a use that supplants any part of
> the normal market for a copyrighted work would ordinarily be
> considered an infringement." Senate Report, at 65.

**\*569** Placed in a broader perspective, a fair use doctrine that
permits extensive prepublication quotations from an unreleased
manuscript without the copyright owner\'s consent poses substantial
potential for damage to the marketability of first serialization rights
in general. "Isolated instances of minor infringements, when multiplied
many times, become in the aggregate a major inroad on copyright that
must be prevented." *Ibid.*

 

V

The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that The Nation\'s use of the
copyrighted material was excused by the public\'s interest in the
subject matter. It erred, as well, in overlooking the unpublished nature
of the work and the resulting impact on the potential market for first
serial rights of permitting unauthorized prepublication excerpts under
the rubric of fair use. Finally, in finding the taking "infinitesimal,"
the Court of Appeals accorded too little weight to the qualitative
importance of the quoted passages of original expression. In sum, the
traditional doctrine of fair use, as embodied in the Copyright Act, does
not sanction the use made by The Nation of these copyrighted materials.
Any copyright infringer may claim to benefit the public by increasing
public access to the copyrighted work. See [*Pacific & Southern Co. v.
Duncan,* 744 F.2d, at 1499--1500.]() But Congress has not designed, and
we see no warrant for judicially imposing, a "compulsory license"
permitting unfettered access to the unpublished copyrighted expression
of public figures.

 

The Nation conceded that its verbatim copying of some 300 words of
direct quotation from the Ford manuscript would constitute an
infringement unless excused as a fair use. Because we find that The
Nation\'s use of these verbatim excerpts from the unpublished manuscript
was not a fair use, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

 

*It is so ordered.*

 

**\*570** APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT

The portions of The Nation article which were copied verbatim from "A
Time to Heal," excepting quotes from Government documents and quotes
attributed by Ford to third persons, are identified in boldface in the
text. See *ante,* at 2237, n. 7. The corresponding passages in the Ford
manuscript are footnoted.

 

THE FORD MEMOIRS BEHIND THE NIXON PARDON

In his memoirs, *A Time To Heal,* which Harper & Row will publish in
late May or early June, former President Gerald R. Ford says that the
idea of giving a blanket pardon to Richard M. Nixon was raised before
Nixon resigned from the Presidency by Gen. Alexander Haig, who was then
the White House chief of staff.

 

Ford also writes that, but for a misunderstanding, he might have
selected Ronald Reagan as his 1976 running mate, that Washington lawyer
Edward Bennett Williams, a Democrat, was his choice for head of the
Central Intelligence Agency, that Nixon was the one who first proposed
Rockefeller for Vice President, and that he regretted his
**"cowardice"**[]{#co_fnRef_B00111985125844_ID0EJZDI_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00111985125844_1) in allowing Rockefeller to
remove himself from Vice Presidential contention. Ford also describes
his often prickly relations with Henry Kissinger.

 

*The Nation* obtained the 655-page typescript before publication.
Advance excerpts **\*\*2236** from the book will appear in *Time* in
mid-April and in *The Reader\'s Digest* thereafter. Although the initial
print order has not been decided, the figure is tentatively set at
50,000; it could change, depending upon the public reaction to the
serialization.

 

Ford\'s account of the Nixon pardon contains significant new detail on
the negotiations and considerations that surrounded **\*571** it.
According to Ford\'s version, the subject was first broached to him by
General Haig on August 1, 1974, a week before Nixon resigned. General
Haig revealed that the newly transcribed White House tapes were the
equivalent of the **"smoking
gun"**[]{#co_fnRef_B00121985125844_ID0E42DI_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00121985125844_1) and that Ford should
prepare himself to become President.

 

Ford was deeply hurt by Haig\'s revelation: **"Over the past several
months Nixon had repeatedly assured me that he was not involved in
Watergate, that the evidence would prove his innocence, that the matter
would fade from view."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00131985125844_ID0EG4DI_1
.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00131985125844_1) Ford had believed him, but
he let Haig explain the President\'s alternatives.

 

He could **"ride it out"**[]{#co_fnRef_B00141985125844_ID0EL5DI_1
.anchor}[^4^](#co_footnote_B00141985125844_1) or he could resign, Haig
said. He then listed the different ways Nixon might resign and concluded
by pointing out that **Nixon could agree to leave in return for an
agreement that the new President, Ford, would pardon
him.**[]{#co_fnRef_B00151985125844_ID0EZ5DI_1
.anchor}[^5^](#co_footnote_B00151985125844_1) Although Ford said it
would be improper for him to make any recommendation, he basically
agreed with Haig\'s assessment and adds, **"Because of his references to
the pardon authority, I did ask Haig about the extent of a President\'s
pardon power."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00161985125844_ID0EJ6DI_1
.anchor}[^6^](#co_footnote_B00161985125844_1)

 

"It\'s my understanding from a White House lawyer," Haig replied, "that
a President does have authority to grant a pardon even before criminal
action has been taken against an individual."

 

**\*572** But because Ford had neglected to tell Haig he thought the
idea of a resignation conditioned on a pardon was improper, his press
aide, Bob Hartmann, suggested that Haig might well have returned to the
White House and told President Nixon that he had mentioned the idea and
Ford seemed comfortable with it. "Silence implies assent."

 

Ford then consulted with White House special counsel James St. Clair,
who had no advice one way or the other on the matter more than pointing
out that he was not the lawyer who had given Haig the opinion on the
pardon. Ford also discussed the matter with Jack Marsh, who felt that
the mention of a pardon in this context was a "time bomb," and with
Bryce Harlow, who had served six Presidents and who agreed that **the
mere mention of a pardon "could cause a lot of
trouble."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00171985125844_ID0E4CAK_1
.anchor}[^7^](#co_footnote_B00171985125844_1)

 

As a result of these various conversations, Vice President Ford called
Haig and read him a written statement: "I want you to understand that I
have no intention of recommending what the President should do about
resigning or not resigning and that nothing we talked about yesterday
afternoon should be given any consideration in whatever decision the
President may wish to make."

 

**\*\*2237** Despite what Haig had told him about the "smoking gun"
tapes, Ford told a Jackson, Mich., luncheon audience later in the day
that **the President was not guilty of an impeachable offense. "Had I
said otherwise at that moment,"** he writes, **"the whole house of cards
might have collapsed."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00181985125844_ID0EFFAK_1
.anchor}[^8^](#co_footnote_B00181985125844_1)

 

In justifying the pardon, Ford goes out of his way to assure the reader
that **"compassion for Nixon as an individual** **\*573** hadn\'t
prompted my decision at all."[]{#co_fnRef_B00191985125844_ID0EWGAK_1
.anchor}[^9^](#co_footnote_B00191985125844_1) Rather, he did it because
he had "to get the monkey off my back one way or the
other."[]{#co_fnRef_B00201985125844_ID0EIHAK_1
.anchor}[^10^](#co_footnote_B00201985125844_1)

 

The precipitating factor in his decision was a series of secret meetings
his general counsel, Phil Buchen, held with Watergate Special Prosecutor
Leon Jaworski in the Jefferson Hotel, where they were both staying at
the time. Ford attributes Jaworski with providing some **"crucial"
information**[]{#co_fnRef_B00211985125844_ID0E4IAK_1
.anchor}[^11^](#co_footnote_B00211985125844_1)---*i.e.,* that Nixon was
under investigation in ten separate areas, and that **the court process
could "take years."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00221985125844_ID0EIJAK_1
.anchor}[^12^](#co_footnote_B00221985125844_1) Ford cites a memorandum
from Jaworski\'s assistant, Henry S. Ruth Jr., as being especially
persuasive. Ruth had written:

 

"If you decide to recommend indictment I think it is fair and proper to
notify Jack Miller and the White House sufficiently in advance so that
pardon action could be taken before the indictment." He went on to say:
"One can make a strong argument for leniency and if President Ford is so
inclined, I think he ought to do it early rather than late."

 

Ford decided that court proceedings against Nixon might take six years,
that **Nixon "would not spend time quietly in San
Clemente,"**[]{#co_fnRef_B00231985125844_ID0EFMAK_1
.anchor}[^13^](#co_footnote_B00231985125844_1) and **"it would be
virtually impossible for me to direct public attention on anything
else."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00241985125844_ID0EVMAK_1
.anchor}[^14^](#co_footnote_B00241985125844_1)

 

Buchen, Haig and Henry Kissinger agreed with him. Hartmann was not so
sure.

 

**\*574** Buchen wanted to condition the pardon on Nixon agreeing to
settle the question of who would retain custody and control over the
tapes and Presidential papers that might be relevant to various
Watergate proceedings, but Ford was reluctant to do that.

 

At one point a plan was considered whereby the Presidential materials
would be kept in a vault at a Federal facility near San Clemente, but
the vault would require two keys to open it. One would be retained by
the General Services Administration, the other by Richard Nixon.

 

The White House did, however, want Nixon to make a full confession on
the occasion of his pardon or, at a minimum, express true contrition.
Ford tells of the negotiation with Jack Miller, Nixon\'s lawyer, over
the wording of Nixon\'s statement. But as Ford reports Miller\'s
response. Nixon was not likely to yield. **"His few meetings with his
client had shown him that the former President\'s ability to discuss
Watergate objectively was almost
nonexistent."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00251985125844_ID0E6PAK_1
.anchor}[^15^](#co_footnote_B00251985125844_1)

 

**\*\*2238** The statement they really wanted was never forthcoming. As
soon as Ford\'s emissary arrived in San Clemente, he was confronted with
an ultimatum by Ron Zeigler, Nixon\'s former press secretary. "Lets get
one thing straight immediately," Zeigler said. "President Nixon is not
issuing any statement whatsoever regarding Watergate, whether Jerry Ford
pardons him or not." Zeigler proposed a draft, which was turned down on
the ground that **"no statement would be better than
that."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00261985125844_ID0EKSAK_1
.anchor}[^16^](#co_footnote_B00261985125844_1) They went through three
more drafts before they agreed on the statement Nixon finally made,
which stopped far short of a full confession.

 

When Ford aide Benton Becker tried to explain to Nixon that acceptance
of a pardon was an admission of guilt, he **\*575** felt the President
wasn\'t really listening. Instead, Nixon wanted to talk about the
Washington Redskins. And when Becker left, Nixon pressed on him some
cuff links and a tiepin "out of my own jewelry box."

 

Ultimately, Ford sums up the philosophy underlying his decision as one
he picked up as a student at Yale Law School many years before. **"I
learned that public policy often took precedence over a rule of law.
Although I respected the tenet that no man should be above the law,
public policy demanded that I put Nixon---and Watergate---behind us as
quickly as possible."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00271985125844_ID0EYUAK_1
.anchor}[^17^](#co_footnote_B00271985125844_1)

 

Later, when Ford learned that Nixon\'s [phlebitis]() had acted up and
his health was seriously impaired, he debated whether to pay the ailing
former President a visit. **"If I made the trip it would remind
everybody of Watergate and the pardon. If I didn\'t, people would say I
lacked compassion."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00281985125844_ID0EPWAK_1
.anchor}[^18^](#co_footnote_B00281985125844_1) Ford went:

 

**He was stretched out flat on his back. There were tubes in his nose
and mouth, and wires led from his arms, chest and legs to machines with
orange lights that blinked on and off. His face was ashen, and I thought
I had never seen anyone closer to
death.**[]{#co_fnRef_B00291985125844_ID0EFYAK_1
.anchor}[^19^](#co_footnote_B00291985125844_1)

 

The manuscript made available to The Nation includes many references to
Henry Kissinger and other personalities who played a major role during
the Ford years.

 

**\*576** *On Kissinger.* Immediately after being informed by Nixon of
his intention to resign, Ford returned to the Executive Office Building
and phoned Henry Kissinger to let him know how he felt. **"Henry,"** he
said, **"I need you. The country needs you. I want you to stay. I\'ll do
everything I can to work with you
."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00301985125844_ID0ER1AK_1
.anchor}[^20^](#co_footnote_B00301985125844_1)

 

"Sir," Kissinger replied, "it is my job to get along with you and not
yours to get along with me."

 

**"We\'ll get along,"** Ford said. **"I know we\'ll get along."**
Referring to Kissinger\'s joint jobs as Secretary of State and National
Security Adviser to the President, Ford said, **"I don\'t want to make
any change. I think it\'s worked out well, so let\'s keep it that
way."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00311985125844_ID0EC4AK_1
.anchor}[^21^](#co_footnote_B00311985125844_1)

 

**\*\*2239** Later Ford did make the change and relieved Kissinger of
his responsibilities as National Security Adviser at the same time that
he fired James Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense. Shortly thereafter,
he reports, Kissinger presented him with a "draft" letter of
resignation, which he said Ford could call upon at will if he felt he
needed it to quiet dissent from conservatives who objected to
Kissinger\'s role in the firing of Schlesinger.

 

*On John Connally.* When Ford was informed that Nixon wanted him to
replace Agnew, he told the President he had **"no ambition to hold
office after January 1977."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00321985125844_ID0E56AK_1
.anchor}[^22^](#co_footnote_B00321985125844_1) Nixon replied that that
was good since his own choice for his running mate in 1976 was John
Connally. "He\'d be excellent," observed Nixon. Ford says he had "no
problem with that."

 

*On the Decision to Run Again.* Ford was, he tells us, so sincere in his
intention not to run again that he thought he would announce it and
enhance his credibility in the country and the Congress, as well as keep
the promise he had made to his wife, Betty.

 

Kissinger talked him out of it. "You can\'t do that. It would be
disastrous from a foreign policy point of view. For the next two and a
half years foreign governments would know that they were dealing with a
lame-duck President. All our initiatives would be dead in the water, and
I wouldn\'t be able to implement your foreign policy. It would probably
have the same consequences in dealing with the Congress on domestic
issues. You can\'t reassert the authority of the Presidency if you leave
yourself hanging out on a dead limb. You\'ve got to be an affirmative
President."

 

**\*577** *On David Kennerly, the White House photographer.* Schlesinger
was arguing with Kissinger and Ford over the appropriate response to the
seizure of the *Mayaguez.* At issue was whether airstrikes against the
Cambodians were desirable; Schlesinger was opposed to bombings.
Following a lull in the conversation, Ford reports, up spoke the
30-year-old White House photographer, David Kennerly, who had been
taking pictures for the last hour.

 

"Has anyone considered," Kennerly asked, "that this might be the act of
a local Cambodian commander who has just taken it into his own hands to
stop any ship that comes by?" Nobody, apparently, had considered it, but
following several seconds of silence, Ford tells us, the view carried
the day. **"Massive airstrikes would constitute overkill,"** Ford
decided. **"It would be far better to have Navy jets from the Coral Sea
make surgical strikes against specific
targets."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00331985125844_ID0ELEBK_1
.anchor}[^23^](#co_footnote_B00331985125844_1)

 

**\*578** *On Nixon\'s Character.* **Nixon\'s flaw,** according to Ford,
**was "pride." "A terribly proud man,"** writes Ford, **"he detested
weakness in other people. I\'d often heard him speak disparagingly of
those whom he felt to be soft and expedient. (Curiously, he didn\'t feel
that the press was weak. Reporters, he sensed, were his adversaries. He
knew they didn\'t like him, and he responded with reciprocal
disdain.)"**[]{#co_fnRef_B00341985125844_ID0EXGBK_1
.anchor}[^24^](#co_footnote_B00341985125844_1)

 

Nixon felt disdain for the Democratic leadership of the House, whom he
also regarded as weak. According to Ford, **"His pride and personal
contempt for weakness had overcome his ability to tell the difference
between right and** **\*\*2240**
**wrong,"**[]{#co_fnRef_B00351985125844_ID0EUIBK_1
.anchor}[^25^](#co_footnote_B00351985125844_1) all of which leads Ford
to wonder whether Nixon had known in advance about Watergate.

 

On hearing Nixon\'s resignation speech, which Ford felt lacked an
adequate plea for forgiveness, he was persuaded that **"Nixon was out of
touch with reality."**[]{#co_fnRef_B00361985125844_ID0E4JBK_1
.anchor}[^26^](#co_footnote_B00361985125844_1)

 

In February of last year, when *The Washington Post* obtained and
printed advance excerpts from H.R. Haldeman\'s memoir, *The Ends of
Power,* on the eve of its publication by Times Books, *The New York
Times* called *The Post\'s* feat "a second-rate burglary."

 

*The Post* disagreed, claiming that its coup represented "first-rate
enterprise" and arguing that it had burglarized nothing, that
publication of the Haldeman memoir came under the Fair Comment doctrine
long recognized by the **\*579** courts, and that "There is a
fundamental journalistic principle here---a First Amendment principle
that was central to the Pentagon Papers case."

 

In the issue of *The Nation* dated May 5, 1979, our special Spring Books
number, we will discuss some of the ethical problems raised by the issue
of disclosure.

 

Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice WHITE and Justice MARSHALL join,
dissenting.

The Court holds that The Nation\'s quotation of 300 words from the
unpublished 200,000-word manuscript of President Gerald R. Ford
infringed the copyright in that manuscript, even though the quotations
related to a historical event of undoubted significance---the
resignation and pardon of President Richard M. Nixon. Although the Court
pursues the laudable goal of protecting "the economic incentive to
create and disseminate ideas," *ante,* at 2230, this zealous defense of
the copyright owner\'s prerogative will, I fear, stifle the broad
dissemination of ideas and information copyright is intended to nurture.
Protection of the copyright owner\'s economic interest is achieved in
this case through an exceedingly narrow definition of the scope of fair
use. The progress of arts and sciences and the robust public debate
essential to an enlightened citizenry are ill served by this constricted
reading of the fair use doctrine. See [17 U.S.C. § 107](). I therefore
respectfully dissent.

 

I

A

This case presents two issues. First, did The Nation\'s use of material
from the Ford manuscript in forms other than direct quotation from that
manuscript infringe Harper & Row\'s copyright. Second, did the quotation
of approximately 300 words from the manuscript infringe the copyright
because this quotation did not constitute "fair use" within the meaning
**\*580** of [§ 107]() of the Copyright Act. [17 U.S.C. § 107](). The
Court finds no need to resolve the threshold copyrightability issue. The
use of 300 words of quotation was, the Court finds, beyond the scope of
fair use and thus a copyright
infringement.[]{#co_fnRef_B00371985125844_ID0EHQBK_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00371985125844_1) Because I disagree with
the Court\'s fair use holding, it is necessary for me to decide the
threshold copyrightability question.

"The enactment of copyright legislation by Congress under the terms of
the Constitution is not based upon any natural right that the author has
in his writings \... but upon the ground that the welfare of the public
will be served and progress of science and useful arts will be promoted
by **\*\*2241** securing to authors for limited periods the exclusive
rights to their writings." H.R.Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 7
(1909). Congress thus seeks to define the rights included in copyright
so as to serve the public welfare and not necessarily so as to maximize
an author\'s control over his or her product. The challenge of copyright
is to strike the "difficult balance between the interests of authors and
inventors in the control and exploitation of their writings and
discoveries on the one hand, and society\'s competing interest in the
free flow of ideas, information, and commerce on the other hand." [*Sony
Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S. 417, 429,
104 S.Ct. 774, 782, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984)]().

 

The "originality" requirement now embodied in § 102 of the Copyright Act
is crucial to maintenance of the appropriate balance between these
competing interests.[]{#co_fnRef_B00381985125844_ID0EYUBK_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00381985125844_1) Properly interpreted
**\*581** in the light of the legislative history, this section extends
copyright protection to an author\'s literary form but permits free use
by others of the ideas and information the author communicates. See
S.Rep. No. 93--983, pp. 107--108 (1974) ("Copyright does not preclude
others from using the ideas or information revealed by the author\'s
work. It pertains to the literary \... form in which the author
expressed intellectual concepts"); [H.R.Rep. No. 94--1476, pp. 56--57
(1976)]() (same); [*New York Times Co. v. United States,* 403 U.S. 713,
726, n. \*, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 2147, n. \*, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971)]()
(BRENNAN, J., concurring) ("\[T\]he copyright laws, of course, protect
only the form of expression and not the ideas expressed"). This
limitation of protection to literary form precludes any claim of
copyright in facts, including historical narration.

.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00391985125844_1)

**\*582** The "promotion of science and the useful arts" requires this
limit on the scope of an author\'s control. Were an author able to
prevent subsequent authors from using concepts, ideas, or facts
contained in his or her work, the creative process would wither and
scholars would be forced into unproductive replication of the research
of their predecessors. See [*Hoehling v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,*
618 F.2d 972, 979 (CA2 1980)](). This limitation on copyright also
ensures consonance with our most important First Amendment values. Cf.
[*Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.,* 433 U.S. 562, 577, n.
13, 97 S.Ct. 2849, 2858 n. 13, 53 L.Ed.2d 965 (1977)](). Our "profound
national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should
be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open," **\*\*2242** [*New York Times
Co. v. Sullivan,* 376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 721, 11 L.Ed.2d 686
(1964)](), leaves no room for a statutory monopoly over information and
ideas. "The arena of public debate would be quiet, indeed, if a
politician could copyright his speeches or a philosopher his treatises
and thus obtain a monopoly on the ideas they contained." [*Lee v.
Runge,* 404 U.S. 887, 893, 92 S.Ct. 197, 200, 30 L.Ed.2d 169 (1971)]()
(Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). A broad
dissemination of principles, ideas, and factual information is crucial
to the robust public debate and informed citizenry that are "the essence
of self-government." [*Garrison v. Louisiana,* 379 U.S. 64, 74--75, 85
S.Ct. 209, 215--216, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964)](). And every citizen must be
permitted freely to marshal ideas and facts in the advocacy of
particular political choices.[]{#co_fnRef_B00401985125844_ID0E5DCK_1
.anchor}[^4^](#co_footnote_B00401985125844_1)

 

It follows that infringement of copyright must be based on a taking of
literary form, as opposed to the ideas or information contained in a
copyrighted work. Deciding whether an infringing appropriation of
literary form has occurred is difficult for at least two reasons. First,
the distinction between **\*583** literary form and information or ideas
is often elusive in practice. Second, infringement must be based on a
*substantial* appropriation of literary form. This determination is
equally challenging. Not surprisingly, the test for infringement has
defied precise formulation.[]{#co_fnRef_B00411985125844_ID0EIGCK_1
.anchor}[^5^](#co_footnote_B00411985125844_1) In general, though, the
inquiry proceeds along two axes: *how closely* has the second author
tracked the first author\'s particular language and structure of
presentation; and *how much* of the first author\'s language and
structure has the second author
appropriated.[]{#co_fnRef_B00421985125844_ID0ETGCK_1
.anchor}[^6^](#co_footnote_B00421985125844_1)

 

In the present case the infringement analysis must be applied to a
historical biography in which the author has chronicled the events of
his White House tenure and commented on those events from his unique
perspective. Apart from the quotations, virtually all of the material in
The Nation\'s article indirectly recounted Mr. Ford\'s factual narrative
of the Nixon resignation and pardon, his latter-day reflections on some
events of his Presidency, and his perceptions of the personalities at
the center of those events. See *ante,* at 2235 -- 2240. No copyright
can be claimed in this information *qua* information. Infringement would
thus have to be based **\*584** on too close and substantial a tracking
of Mr. Ford\'s expression of this
information.[]{#co_fnRef_B00431985125844_ID0EHNCK_1
.anchor}[^7^](#co_footnote_B00431985125844_1)

 

**\*\*2243** *The Language.* Much of the information The Nation conveyed
was not in the form of paraphrase at all, but took the form of synopsis
of lengthy discussions in the Ford
manuscript.[]{#co_fnRef_B00441985125844_ID0E3RCK_1
.anchor}[^8^](#co_footnote_B00441985125844_1) In the course of this
summary presentation, The **\*585** Nation did use occasional sentences
that closely resembled language in the original Ford
manuscript.[]{#co_fnRef_B00451985125844_ID0EKSCK_1
.anchor}[^9^](#co_footnote_B00451985125844_1) But these linguistic
similarities are insufficient to constitute an infringement for three
reasons. First, some leeway must be given to subsequent authors seeking
to convey facts because those "wishing to express the ideas contained in
a factual work **\*586** often can choose from only a narrow range of
expression." [*Landsberg v. Scrabble Crossword Game Players, Inc.,* 736
F.2d 485, 488 (CA9 1984)](). Second, much of what The Nation paraphrased
was material in which Harper & Row could claim no
copyright.[]{#co_fnRef_B00461985125844_ID0E6TCK_1
.anchor}[^10^](#co_footnote_B00461985125844_1) Third, The Nation
paraphrased **\*\*2244** nothing approximating the totality of a single
paragraph, much less a chapter or the work as a whole. At most The
Nation paraphrased disparate isolated sentences from the original. A
finding of infringement based on paraphrase generally requires far more
close and substantial a tracking of the original language than occurred
in this case. See, *e.g.,* [*Wainwright Securities Inc. v. Wall Street
Transcript Corp.,* 558 F.2d 91 (CA2 1977)]().

 

*The Structure of Presentation.* The article does not mimic Mr. Ford\'s
structure. The information The Nation presents is drawn from scattered
sections of the Ford work and does not appear in the sequence in which
Mr. Ford presented it.[]{#co_fnRef_B00471985125844_ID0EEBDK_1
.anchor}[^11^](#co_footnote_B00471985125844_1) Some of The Nation\'s
discussion of the pardon does roughly track the order in which the Ford
manuscript presents information about the pardon. With respect to this
similarity, however, Mr. Ford has done no more than present the facts
**\*587** chronologically and cannot claim infringement when a
subsequent author similarly presents the facts of history in a
chronological manner. Also, it is difficult to suggest that a 2,000-word
article could bodily appropriate the structure of a 200,000-word book.
Most of what Mr. Ford created, and most of the history he recounted,
were simply not represented in The Nation\'s
article.[]{#co_fnRef_B00481985125844_ID0EZBDK_1
.anchor}[^12^](#co_footnote_B00481985125844_1)

 

When The Nation was not quoting Mr. Ford, therefore, its efforts to
convey the historical information in the Ford manuscript did not so
closely and substantially track Mr. Ford\'s language and structure as to
constitute an appropriation of literary form.

 

II

The Nation is thus liable in copyright only if the quotation of 300
words infringed any of Harper & Row\'s exclusive rights under § 106 of
the Act. Section 106 explicitly makes the grant of exclusive rights
"\[s\]ubject to [section 107]() through [118]()." [17 U.S.C. § 106]().
[Section 107]() states: "Notwithstanding the provisions of [section
106](), the fair use of a copyrighted work \... for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies
for classroom use), scholarship or research, is not an infringement of
copyright." The question here is whether The Nation\'s **\*588**
quotation was a noninfringing fair use within the meaning of [§ 107]().

 

Congress "eschewed a rigid, bright-line approach to fair use." [*Sony
Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S., at 449, n.
31, 104 S.Ct., at 792, n. 31.]() A court is to apply an "equitable rule
of reason" analysis, [*id.,* at 448, 104 S.Ct., at 792]() guided by four
statutorily prescribed factors:

> "(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
> is of a **\*\*2245** commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational
> purposes;
>
> "(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
>
> "(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
> the copyrighted work as a whole; and
>
> "(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
> the copyrighted work." [17 U.S.C. § 107]().

These factors are not necessarily the exclusive determinants of the fair
use inquiry and do not mechanistically resolve fair use issues; "no
generally applicable definition is possible, and each case raising the
question must be decided on its own facts." [H.R.Rep. No. 94--1476, at
65](). See also *id.,* at 66 ("\[T\]he endless variety of situations and
combinations of circumstances that can arise in particular cases
precludes the formulation of exact rules in the statute"); S.Rep. No.
94--473, p. 62 (1975). The statutory factors do, however, provide
substantial guidance to courts undertaking the proper fact-specific
inquiry.

 

With respect to a work of history, particularly the memoirs of a public
official, the statutorily prescribed analysis cannot properly be
conducted without constant attention to copyright\'s crucial distinction
between protected literary form and unprotected information or ideas.
The question must always be: Was the subsequent author\'s use of
*literary form* a fair use within the meaning of [§ 107](), in light of
the purpose for the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount
of literary form used, and the effect of this use of literary form on
the value of or market for the original?

 

**\*589** Limiting the inquiry to the propriety of a subsequent
author\'s use of the copyright owner\'s literary form is not easy in the
case of a work of history. Protection against only substantial
appropriation of literary form does not ensure historians a return
commensurate with the full value of their labors. The literary form
contained in works like "A Time to Heal" reflects only a part of the
labor that goes into the book. It is the labor of collecting, sifting,
organizing, and reflecting that predominates in the creation of works of
history such as this one. The value this labor produces lies primarily
in the information and ideas revealed, and not in the particular
collocation of words through which the information and ideas are
expressed. Copyright thus does not protect that which is often of most
value in a work of history, and courts must resist the tendency to
reject the fair use defense on the basis of their feeling that an author
of history has been deprived of the full value of his or her labor. A
subsequent author\'s taking of information and ideas is in no sense
piratical because copyright law simply does not create any property
interest in information and ideas.

 

The urge to compensate for subsequent use of information and ideas is
perhaps understandable. An inequity seems to lurk in the idea that much
of the fruit of the historian\'s labor may be used without compensation.
This, however, is not some unforeseen byproduct of a statutory scheme
intended primarily to ensure a return for works of the imagination.
Congress made the affirmative choice that the copyright laws should
apply in this way: "Copyright does not preclude others from using the
ideas or information revealed by the author\'s work. It pertains to the
literary \... form in which the author expressed intellectual concepts."
[H.R.Rep. No. 94--1476, at 56--57](). This distinction is at the essence
of copyright. The copyright laws serve as the "engine of free
expression," *ante,* at 2230, only when the statutory monopoly does not
choke off multifarious indirect uses and consequent broad dissemination
of information and ideas. To ensure the progress of arts and sciences
and the integrity **\*590** of First Amendment values, ideas and
information must not be freighted with claims of proprietary
right.[]{#co_fnRef_B00491985125844_ID0EUTDK_1
.anchor}[^13^](#co_footnote_B00491985125844_1)

 

**\*\*2246** In my judgment, the Court\'s fair use analysis has fallen
to the temptation to find copyright violation based on a minimal use of
literary form in order to provide compensation for the appropriation of
information from a work of history. The failure to distinguish between
information and literary form permeates every aspect of the Court\'s
fair use analysis and leads the Court to the wrong result in this case.
Application of the statutorily prescribed analysis with attention to the
distinction between information and literary form leads to a
straightforward finding of fair use within the meaning of [§ 107]().

 

*The Purpose of the Use.* The Nation\'s purpose in quoting 300 words of
the Ford manuscript was, as the Court acknowledges, news reporting. See
*ante,* at 2231. The Ford work contained information about important
events of recent history. Two principals, Mr. Ford and General Alexander
Haig, were at the time of The Nation\'s publication in 1979 widely
thought to be candidates for the Presidency. That The Nation objectively
reported the information in the Ford manuscript without independent
commentary in no way diminishes the conclusion that it was reporting
news. A typical newsstory differs from an editorial precisely in that it
presents newsworthy information in a straightforward and unelaborated
manner. Nor does the source of the information render The Nation\'s
article any less a news report. Often books and manuscripts, solicited
and unsolicited, are **\*591** the subject matter of news reports.
*E.g.,* [*New York Times Co. v. United States,* 403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct.
2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971)](). Frequently the manuscripts are
unpublished at the time of the news
report.[]{#co_fnRef_B00501985125844_ID0EHYDK_1
.anchor}[^14^](#co_footnote_B00501985125844_1)

 

[Section 107]() lists news reporting as a prime example of fair use of
another\'s expression. Like criticism and all other purposes Congress
explicitly approved in [§ 107](), news reporting informs the public; the
language of [§ 107]() makes clear that Congress saw the spread of
knowledge and information as the strongest justification for a properly
limited appropriation of expression. The Court of Appeals was therefore
correct to conclude that the purpose of The Nation\'s
use---dissemination of the information contained in the quotations of
Mr. Ford\'s work---furthered the public interest. [723 F.2d 195,
207--208 (CA2 1983)](). In light of the explicit congressional
endorsement in [§ 107](), the purpose for which Ford\'s literary form
was borrowed strongly favors a finding of fair use.

 

The Court concedes the validity of the news reporting
purpose[]{#co_fnRef_B00511985125844_ID0EN2DK_1
.anchor}[^15^](#co_footnote_B00511985125844_1) but then quickly offsets
it against three purportedly countervailing considerations. First, the
Court asserts that because The Nation publishes for profit, its
publication of **\*592** the Ford quotes is a presumptively unfair
commercial use. Second, the Court claims that The Nation\'s stated
desire to create a "news **\*\*2247** event" signaled an illegitimate
purpose of supplanting the copyright owner\'s right of first
publication. *Ante,* at 2231. Third, The Nation acted in bad faith, the
Court claims, because its editor "knowingly exploited a purloined
manuscript." *Ibid.*

 

The Court\'s reliance on the commercial nature of The Nation\'s use as
"a separate factor that tends to weigh against a finding of fair use,"
*ante,* at 2231, is inappropriate in the present context. Many uses [§
107]() lists as paradigmatic examples of fair use, including criticism,
comment, and *news reporting,* are generally conducted for profit in
this country, a fact of which Congress was obviously aware when it
enacted [§ 107](). To negate any argument favoring fair use based on
news reporting or criticism because that reporting or criticism was
published for profit is to render meaningless the congressional
imprimatur placed on such uses.[]{#co_fnRef_B00521985125844_ID0E3AEK_1
.anchor}[^16^](#co_footnote_B00521985125844_1)

 

Nor should The Nation\'s intent to create a "news event" weigh against a
finding of fair use. Such a rule, like the **\*593** Court\'s automatic
presumption against news reporting for profit, would undermine the
congressional validation of the news reporting purpose. A news business
earns its reputation, and therefore its readership, through consistent
prompt publication of news---and often through "scooping" rivals. More
importantly, the Court\'s failure to maintain the distinction between
information and literary form colors the analysis of this point. Because
Harper & Row had no legitimate copyright interest in the information and
ideas in the Ford manuscript, The Nation had every right to seek to be
the first to disclose these facts and ideas to the public. The record
suggests only that The Nation sought to be the first to reveal the
information in the Ford manuscript. The Nation\'s stated purpose of
scooping the competition should under those circumstances have no
negative bearing on the claim of fair use. Indeed the Court\'s reliance
on this factor would seem to amount to little more than distaste for the
standard journalistic practice of seeking to be the first to publish
news.

 

The Court\'s reliance on The Nation\'s putative bad faith is equally
unwarranted. No court has found that The Nation possessed the Ford
manuscript illegally or in violation of any common-law interest of
Harper & Row; all common-law causes of action have been abandoned or
dismissed in this case. [723 F.2d, at 199--201.]() Even if the
manuscript had been "purloined" by someone, nothing in this record
imputes culpability to The
Nation.[]{#co_fnRef_B00531985125844_ID0ERHEK_1
.anchor}[^17^](#co_footnote_B00531985125844_1) On the basis of the
record in this case, the most that can be said is that The Nation made
use of the contents of the manuscript knowing the copyright owner would
not sanction the use.

 

**\*594** **\*\*2248** At several points the Court brands this conduct
thievery. See, *e.g., ante,* at 2228, 2232. This judgment is
unsupportable, and is perhaps influenced by the Court\'s unspoken
tendency in this case to find infringement based on the taking of
information and ideas. With respect to the appropriation of information
and ideas other than the quoted words, The Nation\'s use was perfectly
legitimate despite the copyright owner\'s objection because no copyright
can be claimed in ideas or information. Whether the quotation of 300
words was an infringement or a fair use within the meaning of [§ 107]()
is a close question that has produced sharp division in both this Court
and the Court of Appeals. If the Copyright Act were held not to prohibit
the use, then the copyright owner would have had no basis in law for
objecting. The Nation\'s awareness of an objection that has a
significant chance of being adjudged unfounded cannot amount to bad
faith. Imputing bad faith on the basis of no more than knowledge of such
an objection, the Court impermissibly prejudices the inquiry and impedes
arrival at the proper conclusion that the "purpose" factor of the
statutorily prescribed analysis strongly favors a finding of fair use in
this case.

 

*The Nature of the Copyrighted Work.* In *Sony Corp. of America v.
Universal City Studios, Inc.,* we stated that "not \... all copyrights
are fungible" and that "\[c\]opying a news broadcast may have a stronger
claim to fair use than copying a motion picture." [464 U.S., at 455, n.
40, 104 S.Ct., at 795, n. 40.]() These statements reflect the principle,
suggested in [§ 107(2)]() of the Act, that the scope of fair use is
generally broader when the source of borrowed expression is a factual or
historical work. See 3 Nimmer § 13.05\[A\] \[2\], at 13--73---13--74.
"\[I\]nformational works," like the Ford manuscript, "that readily lend
themselves to productive use by others, are less protected." [*Sony
Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S., at
496--497, 104 S.Ct., at 816]() (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). Thus the
second statutory factor also favors a finding of fair use in this case.

 

**\*595** The Court acknowledges that "\[t\]he law generally recognizes
a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or
fantasy," *ante,* at 2228, and that "\[s\]ome of the briefer quotations
from the memoir are arguably necessary to convey the facts," *ibid.* But
the Court discounts the force of this consideration, primarily on the
ground that "\[t\]he fact that a work is unpublished is a crucial
element of its 'nature.' " *Ante,* at
2228.[]{#co_fnRef_B00541985125844_ID0EEREK_1
.anchor}[^18^](#co_footnote_B00541985125844_1) At this point the Court
introduces into analysis of this case a categorical presumption against
prepublication fair use. See *ante,* at 2228 ("Under ordinary
circumstances, the author\'s right to control the first public
appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of
fair use").

 

This categorical presumption is unwarranted on its own terms and
unfaithful to congressional
intent.[]{#co_fnRef_B00551985125844_ID0EXTEK_1
.anchor}[^19^](#co_footnote_B00551985125844_1) Whether a **\*596**
particular **\*\*2249** prepublication use will impair any interest the
Court identifies as encompassed within the right of first publication,
see *ante,* at 2227--2228,[]{#co_fnRef_B00561985125844_ID0ETUEK_1
.anchor}[^20^](#co_footnote_B00561985125844_1) will depend on the nature
of the copyrighted work, the timing of prepublication use, the amount of
expression used and the medium in which the second author communicates.
Also, certain uses might be tolerable for some purposes but not for
others. See [*Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,
supra,* at 490, n. 40, 104 S.Ct., at 813, n. 40.]() The Court is
ambiguous as to whether it relies on the force of the presumption
against prepublication fair use or an analysis of the purpose and effect
of this particular use. Compare *ante,* at 2227--2228, with *ante,* at
2233. To the extent the Court relies on the presumption, it presumes
intolerable **\*597** injury---in particular the usurpation of the
economic interest[]{#co_fnRef_B00571985125844_ID0E1WEK_1
.anchor}[^21^](#co_footnote_B00571985125844_1)---based on no more than a
quick litmus test for prepublication timing. Because "Congress has
plainly instructed us that fair use analysis calls for a sensitive
balancing of interests," we held last Term that the fair use inquiry
could never be resolved on the basis of such a "two dimensional"
categorical approach. See [*Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City
Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S., at 455, n. 40, 104 S.Ct., at 795, n. 40]()
(rejecting categorical requirement of "productive use").

 

To the extent the Court purports to evaluate the facts of this case, its
analysis relies on sheer speculation. The quotation of 300 words from
the manuscript infringed no privacy interest of Mr. Ford. This author
intended the words in the manuscript to be a public statement about his
Presidency. Lacking, therefore, is the "deliberate choice on the part of
the copyright owner" to keep expression confidential, a consideration
that the Senate Report---in the passage on which the Court places great
reliance, see *ante,* at 2227 ---recognized as the impetus behind
narrowing fair use for unpublished works. See S.Rep. No. 94--473, at 64.
See also 3 Nimmer § 13.05\[A\], at 13--73 ("\[T\]he scope of the fair
use **\*\*2250** doctrine is considerably narrower with respect to
unpublished works *which are held confidential by their copyright
owners* ") (emphasis added). What the Court depicts as the copyright
owner\'s "confidentiality" interest, see *ante,* at 2233, is not a
privacy interest at all. Rather, it is no more than an economic interest
in capturing the full value of initial release of information to
**\*598** the public, and is properly analyzed as such. See *infra,* at
2233--2234. Lacking too is any suggestion that The Nation\'s use
interfered with the copyright owner\'s interest in editorial control of
the manuscript. The Nation made use of the Ford quotes on the eve of
official publication.

 

Thus the only interest The Nation\'s prepublication use might have
infringed is the copyright owner\'s interest in capturing the full
economic value of initial release. By considering this interest as a
component of the "nature" of the copyrighted work, the Court\'s analysis
deflates The Nation\'s claim that the informational nature of the work
supports fair use without any inquiry into the actual or potential
economic harm of The Nation\'s particular prepublication use. For this
reason, the question of economic harm is properly considered under the
fourth statutory factor---the effect on the value of or market for the
copyrighted work, [17 U.S.C. § 107(4)]()---and not as a presumed element
of the "nature" of the copyright.

 

*The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used.* More difficult
questions arise with respect to judgments about the importance to this
case of the amount and substantiality of the quotations used. The Nation
quoted only approximately 300 words from a manuscript of more than
200,000 words, and the quotes are drawn from isolated passages in
disparate sections of the work. The judgment that this taking was
quantitatively "infinitesimal," [723 F.2d, at 209,]() does not dispose
of the inquiry, however. An evaluation of substantiality in qualitative
terms is also required. Much of the quoted material was Mr. Ford\'s
matter-of-fact representation of the words of others in conversations
with him; such quotations are "arguably necessary adequately to convey
the facts," *ante,* at 2232, and are not rich in expressive content.
Beyond these quotations a portion of the quoted material was drawn from
the most poignant expression in the Ford manuscript; in particular The
Nation made use of six examples of Mr. Ford\'s expression of his
reflections on **\*599** events or perceptions about President
Nixon.[]{#co_fnRef_B00581985125844_ID0EDJFK_1
.anchor}[^22^](#co_footnote_B00581985125844_1) The fair use inquiry
turns on the propriety of the use of these quotations with admittedly
strong expressive content.

 

The Court holds that "in view of the expressive value of the excerpts
and their key role in the infringing work," this third statutory factor
disfavors a finding of fair **\*\*2251**
use.[]{#co_fnRef_B00591985125844_ID0ENTFK_1
.anchor}[^23^](#co_footnote_B00591985125844_1) **\*600** To support this
conclusion, the Court purports to rely on the District Court factual
findings that The Nation had taken "the heart of the book." 557 F.Supp.
1062, 1072 (SDNY 1983). This reliance is misplaced, and would appear to
be another result of the Court\'s failure to distinguish between
information and literary form. When the District Court made this
finding, it was evaluating not the quoted words at issue here but the
"totality" of the information and reflective commentary in the Ford
work. *Ibid.* The vast majority of what the District Court considered
the heart of the Ford work, therefore, consisted of ideas and
information The Nation was free to use. It may well be that, as a
qualitative matter, most of the value of the manuscript did lie in the
information and ideas The Nation used. But appropriation of the "heart"
of the manuscript in this sense is irrelevant to copyright analysis
because copyright does not preclude a second author\'s use of
information and ideas.

 

Perhaps tacitly recognizing that reliance on the District Court finding
is unjustifiable, the Court goes on to evaluate independently the
quality of the expression appearing in The Nation\'s article. The Court
states that "\[t\]he portions actually quoted were selected by Mr.
Navasky as among the most powerful passages." *Ante,* at 2232. On the
basis of no more than this observation, and perhaps also inference from
the fact that the quotes were important to The Nation\'s
article,[]{#co_fnRef_B00601985125844_ID0EKYFK_1
.anchor}[^24^](#co_footnote_B00601985125844_1) the Court adheres to its
conclusion that The Nation appropriated the heart of the Ford
manuscript.

 

**\*601** At least with respect to the six particular quotes of Mr.
Ford\'s observations and reflections about President Nixon, I agree with
the Court\'s conclusion that The Nation appropriated some literary form
of substantial quality. I do not agree, however, that the substantiality
of the expression taken was clearly excessive or inappropriate to The
Nation\'s news reporting purpose.

 

Had these quotations been used in the context of a critical book review
of the Ford work, there is little question that such a use would be fair
use within the meaning of [§ 107]() of the Act. The amount and
substantiality of the use---in both quantitative and qualitative
terms---would have certainly been appropriate to the purpose of such a
use. It is difficult to see how the use of these quoted words in a news
report is less appropriate. The Court acknowledges as much: "\[E\]ven
substantial quotations might qualify as a fair use in a review of a
published work or a news account of a speech that had been delivered to
the public." See *ante,* at 2232. With respect to the motivation for the
pardon and the insights into the psyche of the fallen President, for
example, Mr. Ford\'s reflections and perceptions are so laden with
emotion and deeply personal value judgments that full understanding is
immeasurably enhanced by reproducing a limited portion of Mr. Ford\'s
own words. The importance of the work, after all, lies not only in
revelation of previously unknown fact but also in revelation of the
thoughts, ideas, motivations, and fears of two Presidents at a
**\*\*2252** critical moment in our national history. Thus, while the
question is not easily resolved, it is difficult to say that the use of
the six quotations was gratuitous in relation to the news reporting
purpose.

 

Conceding that even substantial quotation is appropriate in a news
report of a *published* work, the Court would seem to agree that this
quotation was not clearly inappropriate in relation to The Nation\'s
news reporting purpose. For the Court, the determinative factor is again
that the substantiality of the use was inappropriate in relation to the
prepublication **\*602** timing of that use. That is really an objection
to the effect of this use on the market for the copyrighted work, and is
properly evaluated as such.

 

*The Effect on the Market.* The Court correctly notes that the effect on
the market "is undoubtedly the single most important element of fair
use." *Ante,* at 2233, citing 3 Nimmer § 13.05\[A\], at 13--76, and the
Court properly focuses on whether The Nation\'s use adversely affected
Harper & Row\'s serialization potential and not merely the market for
sales of the Ford work itself. *Ante,* at 2233. Unfortunately, the
Court\'s failure to distinguish between the use of information and the
appropriation of literary form badly skews its analysis of this factor.

 

For purposes of fair use analysis, the Court holds, it is sufficient
that the *entire article* containing the quotes eroded the serialization
market potential of Mr. Ford\'s work. *Ante,* at 2234. On the basis of
Time\'s cancellation of its serialization agreement, the Court finds
that "\[r\]arely will a case of copyright infringement present such
clear-cut evidence of actual damage." *Ibid.* In essence, the Court
finds that by using some quotes in a story about the Nixon pardon, The
Nation "competed for a share of the market of prepublication excerpts"
*ante,* at 2234, because Time planned to excerpt from the chapters about
the pardon.

 

The Nation\'s publication indisputably precipitated Time\'s eventual
cancellation. But that does not mean that The Nation\'s use of the 300
quoted words caused this injury to Harper & Row. Wholly apart from these
quoted words, The Nation published significant information and ideas
from the Ford manuscript. If it was this publication of information, and
not the publication of the few quotations, that caused Time to abrogate
its serialization agreement, then whatever the negative effect on the
serialization market, that effect was the product of wholly legitimate
activity.

 

The Court of Appeals specifically held that "the evidence does not
support a finding that it was the very limited use of expression per se
which led to *Time\'s* decision not to print excerpts." **\*603** [723
F.2d, at 208.]() I fully agree with this holding. If The Nation competed
with Time, the competition was not for a share of the market in excerpts
of literary form but for a share of the market in the new information in
the Ford work. That the information, and not the literary form,
represents most of the real value of the work in this case is perhaps
best revealed by the following provision in the contract between Harper
& Row and Mr. Ford:

> "Author acknowledges that the value of the rights granted to publisher
> hereunder would be substantially diminished by Author\'s public
> discussion of the unique information not previously disclosed about
> Author\'s career and personal life which will be included in the Work,
> and Author agrees that Author will endeavor not to disseminate any
> such information in any media, including television, radio and
> newspaper and magazine interviews prior to the first publication of
> the work hereunder." App. 484.

The contract thus makes clear that Harper & Row sought to benefit
substantially from monopolizing the initial revelation of information
known only to Ford.

 

Because The Nation was the first to convey the information in this case,
it did perhaps take from Harper & Row some of the value that publisher
sought to garner for itself through the contractual arrangement
**\*\*2253** with Ford and the license to Time. Harper & Row had every
right to seek to monopolize revenue from that potential market through
contractual arrangements but it has no right to set up copyright as a
shield from competition in that market because copyright does not
protect information. The Nation had every right to seek to be the first
to publish that information.[]{#co_fnRef_B00611985125844_ID0ESDGK_1
.anchor}[^25^](#co_footnote_B00611985125844_1)

 

*Balancing the Interests.* Once the distinction n between information
and literary form is made clear, the statutorily prescribed process of
weighing the four statutory fair use factors discussed above leads
naturally to a conclusion that The Nation\'s limited use of literary
form was not an infringement. Both the purpose of the use and the nature
of the copyrighted work strongly favor the fair use defense here. The
Nation appropriated Mr. Ford\'s expression for a purpose Congress
expressly authorized in [§ 107]() and borrowed from a work whose nature
justifies some appropriation to facilitate the spread of information.
The factor that is perhaps least favorable to the claim of fair use is
the amount and substantiality of the expression used. Without question,
a portion of the expression appropriated was among the most poignant in
the Ford manuscript. But it is difficult to conclude that this taking
was excessive in relation to the news reporting purpose. In any event,
because the appropriation of literary form---as opposed to the use of
information---was not shown to injure Harper & Row\'s economic interest,
any uncertainty with respect to the propriety of the amount of
expression borrowed should be resolved in favor of a finding of fair
use.[]{#co_fnRef_B00621985125844_ID0ECIGK_1
.anchor}[^26^](#co_footnote_B00621985125844_1) In light of the
circumscribed scope of the quotation in The Nation\'s article and the
undoubted validity of the purpose **\*604** motivating that quotation, I
must conclude that the Court has simply adopted an exceedingly narrow
view of fair use in order to impose liability for what was in essence a
taking of unprotected information.

 

III

The Court\'s exceedingly narrow approach to fair use permits Harper &
Row to monopolize information. This holding "effect\[s\] an important
extension of property rights and a corresponding curtailment in the free
use of knowledge and of ideas." [*International News Service v.
Associated Press,* 248 U.S., at 263, 39 S.Ct., at 81]() (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting). The Court has perhaps advanced the ability of the
historian---or at least the public official who has recently left
office---to capture the full economic value of information in his or her
possession. But the Court does so only by risking the robust debate of
public issues that is the "essence of self-government." [*Garrison v.
Louisiana,* 379 U.S., at 74--75, 85 S.Ct., at 215--216.]() The Nation
was providing the grist for that robust debate. The Court imposes
liability upon The Nation for no other reason than that The Nation
succeeded in being the first to provide certain information to the
public. I dissent.
