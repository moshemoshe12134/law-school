**Synopsis**

**Background:** Newspaper owner sued technology company and affiliated
artificial-intelligence (AI) company for copyright infringement,
alleging that AI company had wrongly used newspaper owner\'s content to
train AI models and create generative-AI tools. AI company moved to
compel production by newspaper owner of evidence related to newspaper
owner\'s use of generative-AI tools of nonparties, newspaper owner\'s
creation and use of its own generative-AI products, and newspaper
owner\'s position regarding generative AI.

 

[**\[Holding:\]**](#co_anchor_F42082449634_1) The District Court, [Ona
T. Wang](), United States Magistrate Judge, held that the discovery
sought was not relevant, and AI company thus was not entitled to it.

 

Motion denied.

 

**Procedural Posture(s):** Motion to Compel Discovery.

**[OPINION & ORDER]{.underline}**

[ONA T. WANG](), United States Magistrate Judge:

> **\*596** **I. BACKGROUND**

[**^\[1\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F12082449634_1)The New York Times (the
"Times" or "Plaintiff") brought this action alleging, *inter alia*, that
Defendants unlawfully used Plaintiff\'s copyrighted works to train
Defendants' large-language models ("LLMs"). Defendant OpenAI, Inc.
("Defendant") seeks to compel[]{#co_fnRef_B00012082449634_ID0ELQAE_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00012082449634_1) production of: (1) the
Times\'s use of nonparties' generative artificial intelligence ("Gen
AI") tools; (2) the Times\'s creation and use of its own Gen AI
products; and (3) the Times\'s position regarding Gen AI (e.g.,
positions expressed outside of litigation, knowledge about the training
of third-party Gen AI tools using the Time\'s works). (ECF 236).
Defendant asserts that this outstanding discovery is relevant to their
fair use defense. (ECF 236). Plaintiff asserts that the disputed
discovery concerning Plaintiff\'s interactions with their own and
nonparties' Gen AI tools are neither relevant nor proportional to the
needs of the case. (ECF 238). Because Defendant has not demonstrated the
relevance of the information sought, their motion to compel is
**DENIED.**

 

> **\*597** **II. LEGAL STANDARD**

[**^\[2\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F22082449634_1)
[**^\[3\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F32082449634_1)[Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 26(b)(1)]() permits discovery of "any nonprivileged matter
that is relevant to any party\'s claim or defense and proportional to
the needs of the case." The party moving to compel, here OpenAI, "bears
the initial burden of demonstrating relevance and proportionality."
*See* [*Winfield v. City of New York*, No. 15-CV-5236 (LTS) (KHP), 2018
WL 840085, at \*3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 12, 2018)](). "Motions to compel and
motions to quash a subpoena are both entrusted to the sound discretion
of the court." [*Howard v. City of New York*, No. 12-CV-933 (JMF), 2013
WL 174210, at \*1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 2013)]().

 

> **III. DISCUSSION**

The Copyright Act (the "Act") allows for certain "fair" uses of
copyrighted works and sets out four non-exclusive factors for courts to
consider in determining whether a particular use is "fair":

> I. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
> of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
>
> II\. the nature of the copyrighted work;
>
> III\. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
> the copyrighted work as a whole; and
>
> IV\. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
> the copyrighted work.

[*Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 178-79
(2d Cir. 2024)](). Each of these factors requires scrutiny of a
[defendant\'s]{.underline} purported use of the copyrighted work(s), and
whether that [defendant\'s]{.underline} use may constitute "fair use"
under the Act. The factors do [not]{.underline} require a court to
examine statements or comments a copyright holder may have made about a
defendant\'s general industry, whether the copyright holder has used
tools in the defendant\'s general industry, whether the copyright holder
has admitted that other uses of its copyrights may or may not constitute
fair use, or whether the copyright holder has entered into business
relationships with other entities in the defendant\'s industry.

 

[**^\[4\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F42082449634_1)Defendant argues that the
discovery they seek is relevant to "the Times\'s own claim that the mere
existence of this technology is a threat to its business model and the
enterprise of journalism." (*See* ECF 236, at 2). However, the
"statement" referenced by Defendant is not a claim or defense; it is a
heading in the Amended Complaint: "GenAI Products Threaten High-Quality
Journalism," which precedes paragraphs 47 through 54. (ECF 170, at 14).
This section discusses the Times\'s protection of its own journalistic
content, the limited content available to search engines, and prior
discussions with Defendant to "explore the possibility of an amicable
resolution," which apparently were unsuccessful. (ECF 170 ¶ 54). There
is no wholesale indictment of Gen AI tools, nor is there any suggestion
that the Times allows third parties unfettered, unpaid access to its
copyrighted journalistic content.[]{#co_fnRef_B00022082449634_ID0ETZAE_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00022082449634_1) The AC is tightly focused
on Defendant\'s particular **\*598** Gen AI products and their alleged
use of the Times\'s copyrighted content.

 

None of the cases cited by Defendant support the assertion that the
discovery sought is relevant to their fair use defense or to the heading
in the Amended Complaint. For example, [*Google v. Oracle*]() does not
support a modification of the fourth fair use factor to include
discovery about Plaintiff\'s views on or statements about the "public
benefits" of Gen AI in journalism. [593 U.S. 1, 35-36, 141 S.Ct. 1183,
209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021)](). Rather, the Supreme Court suggested a more
nuanced view of the market effects, one that requires consideration of
the importance of the "public benefits the copying will likely produce"
to "copyright\'s concern for the creative production of new expression"
and a balancing against the potential loss to the copyright owner,
"taking into account \... the nature of the source of the loss." [*Id.*
at 35-36, 141 S.Ct. 1183]() (internal quotations omitted). Discovery
regarding the loss to the copyright owner would consist of documents
concerning licensing discussions, which the Times has already agreed to
produce, (*see, supra* n. 1), and discovery from Defendant on how its
use might "kill demand for the original." *C.f.* [*Oracle*, 593 U.S. at
35, 141 S.Ct. 1183]() ("But a potential loss of revenue is not the whole
story. We here must consider not just the amount but also the source of
the loss. As we pointed out in *Campbell \[v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*,
510 U.S. 569, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994)\][*Campbell \[v.
Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994)\]](), a lethal parody, like a scathing theatre review, may kill
demand for the original \... Yet this kind of harm, even if directly
translated into foregone dollars, is not cognizable under the Copyright
Act.") (internal quotations omitted). Similarly, discovery concerning
the "public benefits \[from\] the copying" would be directed to the
Defendant and the public benefits of its copying, not whether
nonparties' Gen AI tools (which presumably were developed without
copying) serve a general public benefit.

 

The Second Circuit took the same approach in [*Am. Geophysical Un. v.
Texaco Inc.*](), focusing on how [Texaco\'s]{.underline} copying, and
its use of those copies, met (or did not meet) the fair use factors. [60
F.3d 913, 927 (2d Cir. 1995)]() ("Since we are concerned with the claim
of fair use in copying the eight individual articles from \[the
journal\] *Catalysis*, the analysis under the fourth factor must focus
on the effect of Texaco\'s photocopying upon the potential market for or
value of these individual articles."). The copyright holder\'s other use
or licensing of their own works to other nonparties was simply not at
issue in the fair use determination, and [*Google*]() and [*Texaco*]()
do not support a finding of relevance here for the same.

 

[**^\[5\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F52082449634_1)Similarly, [*Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*]() does not stand for
the proposition that "the Times\'s creation, use and positions on
\[others' Gen AI\] generally is directly relevant" to Defendant\'s fair
use defense. (ECF 236 at 1) ("[\[T\]he technology]{.underline} yields
transformative and productive benefits for the enterprise of journalism
specifically.") ([emphasis]{.underline} added). Whether nonparties' Gen
AI tools confer benefits on the journalism industry is not relevant to a
determination of whether Defendant\'s acts---i.e., the alleged copying
involving Defendant\'s Gen AI tools---constitute fair
use.[]{#co_fnRef_B00032082449634_ID0EEGAG_1
.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00032082449634_1) The fair use factors are
concerned with "[the copier\'s]{.underline} **\*599** [use]{.underline}
of an original work." *See* [*Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual
Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508, 528, 143 S.Ct. 1258, 215 L.Ed.2d
473 (2023)]().

 

> **IV. CONCLUSION**

This case is about whether Defendant trained their LLMs using
Plaintiff\'s copyrighted material, and whether that use constitutes
copyright infringement. (ECF 170, ¶¶ 158-168). It is not a referendum on
the benefits of Gen AI, on Plaintiff\'s business practices, or about
whether any of Plaintiff\'s employees use Gen AI at work. The broad
scope of document production sought here is simply not relevant to
Defendant\'s purported fair use defense. For example, if a copyright
holder sued a video game manufacturer for copyright infringement, the
copyright holder might be required to produce documents relating to
their interactions with that video game manufacturer, but the video game
manufacturer would not be entitled to wide-ranging discovery concerning
the copyright holder\'s employees' gaming history, statements about
video games generally, or even their licensing of different content to
other video game manufacturers.

 

Accordingly, because Defendant has failed to demonstrate the relevance
of the information sought, Defendant\'s motion to compel is **DENIED.**

 

**SO ORDERED.**

                                                        ([emphasis]{.underline} added). Moreover, the Times is already
