**Synopsis**

Holders of copyright to song sued rap music group for copyright
infringement. The United States District Court for the Middle District
of Tennessee, [Thomas A. Wiseman, Jr.](), J., [754 F. Supp. 1150,]()
granted summary judgment for rap group, and copyright holders appealed.
The Court of Appeals, [972 F.2d 1429,]() reversed and remanded, based on
finding that rap group\'s parody was not fair use of copyrighted song.
Writ of certiorari was granted. The Supreme Court, Justice [Souter](),
held that commercial character of song parody did not create presumption
against fair use.

 

Reversed and remanded.

 

Justice [Kennedy]() filed concurring opinion.

 

**Procedural Posture(s):** On Appeal; Motion for Summary Judgment.

Respondent Acuff--Rose Music, Inc., filed suit against petitioners, the
members of the rap music group 2 Live Crew and their record company,
claiming that 2 Live Crew\'s song, "Pretty Woman," infringed
Acuff--Rose\'s copyright in Roy Orbison\'s rock ballad, "Oh, Pretty
Woman." The District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live Crew,
holding that its song was a parody that made fair use of the original
song. See Copyright Act of 1976, [17 U.S.C. § 107](). The Court of
Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the commercial nature of the
parody rendered it presumptively unfair under the first of four factors
relevant under [§ 107](); that, by taking the "heart" of the original
and making it the "heart" of a new work, 2 Live Crew had, qualitatively,
taken too much under the third [§ 107]() factor; and that market harm
for purposes of the fourth [§ 107]() factor had been established by a
presumption attaching to commercial uses.

 

*Held:* 2 Live Crew\'s commercial parody may be a fair use within the
meaning of [§ 107](). Pp. 1169--1179.

 

\(a\) [Section 107](), which provides that "the fair use of a
copyrighted work \... for purposes such as criticism \[or\] comment \...
is not an infringement \...," continues the common-law tradition of fair
use adjudication and requires case-by-case analysis rather than
bright-line rules. The statutory examples of permissible uses provide
only general guidance. The four statutory factors are to be explored and
weighed together in light of copyright\'s purpose of promoting science
and the arts. Pp. 1169--1171.

 

\(b\) Parody, like other comment and criticism, may claim fair use.
Under the first of the four [§ 107]() factors, "the purpose and
character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
nature \...," the enquiry focuses on whether the new work merely
supersedes the objects of the original creation, or whether and to what
extent it is "transformative," altering the original with new
expression, meaning, or message. The more transformative the new work,
the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism,
that may weigh against a finding of fair use. The heart of any
parodist\'s claim to quote from existing material is the use of some
elements of a prior author\'s composition to **\*570** create a new one
that, at least in part, comments on that author\'s work. But that tells
courts little about where to draw the line. Thus, like other uses,
parody has to work its way through the relevant factors. Pp. 1171--1172.

 

\(c\) The Court of Appeals properly assumed that 2 Live Crew\'s song
contains parody commenting on and criticizing the original work, but
erred in giving virtually dispositive weight to the commercial nature of
that parody by way of a presumption, ostensibly culled from [*Sony Corp.
of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S. 417, 451, 104
S.Ct. 774, 792, 78 L.Ed.2d 574,]() that "every commercial use of
copyrighted **\*\*1167** material is presumptively \... unfair\...." The
statute makes clear that a work\'s commercial nature is only one element
of the first factor enquiry into its purpose and character, and *Sony*
itself called for no hard evidentiary presumption. The Court of
Appeals\'s rule runs counter to *Sony* and to the long common-law
tradition of fair use adjudication. Pp. 1172--1174.

 

\(d\) The second [§ 107]() factor, "the nature of the copyrighted work,"
is not much help in resolving this and other parody cases, since
parodies almost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works, like
the Orbison song here. P. 1175.

 

\(e\) The Court of Appeals erred in holding that, as a matter of law, 2
Live Crew copied excessively from the Orbison original under the third
[§ 107]() factor, which asks whether "the amount and substantiality of
the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole" are
reasonable in relation to the copying\'s purpose. Even if 2 Live Crew\'s
copying of the original\'s first line of lyrics and characteristic
opening bass riff may be said to go to the original\'s "heart," that
heart is what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is
the heart at which parody takes aim. Moreover, 2 Live Crew thereafter
departed markedly from the Orbison lyrics and produced otherwise
distinctive music. As to the lyrics, the copying was not excessive in
relation to the song\'s parodic purpose. As to the music, this Court
expresses no opinion whether repetition of the bass riff is excessive
copying, but remands to permit evaluation of the amount taken, in light
of the song\'s parodic purpose and character, its transformative
elements, and considerations of the potential for market substitution.
Pp. 1175--1177.

 

\(f\) The Court of Appeals erred in resolving the fourth [§ 107]()
factor, "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
the copyrighted work," by presuming, in reliance on [*Sony, supra,* at
451, 104 S.Ct., at 793,]() the likelihood of significant market harm
based on 2 Live Crew\'s use for commercial gain. No "presumption" or
inference of market harm that might find support in *Sony* is applicable
to a case involving something beyond mere duplication for commercial
purposes. The cognizable harm is market substitution, not any harm from
criticism. As to parody **\*571** pure and simple, it is unlikely that
the work will act as a substitute for the original, since the two works
usually serve different market functions. The fourth factor requires
courts also to consider the potential market for derivative works. See,
*e.g.,* [*Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises,* 471 U.S.
539, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985).]() If the later work has
cognizable substitution effects in protectible markets for derivative
works, the law will look beyond the criticism to the work\'s other
elements. 2 Live Crew\'s song comprises not only parody but also rap
music. The absence of evidence or affidavits addressing the effect of 2
Live Crew\'s song on the derivative market for a nonparody, rap version
of "Oh, Pretty Woman" disentitled 2 Live Crew, as the proponent of the
affirmative defense of fair use, to summary judgment. Pp. 1177--1179.

 

[972 F.2d 1429 (CA6 1992)](), reversed and remanded.

 

[SOUTER](), J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
[KENNEDY](), J., filed a concurring opinion, *post,* p. 1180.

**Opinion**

Justice [SOUTER]() delivered the opinion of the Court.

We are called upon to decide whether 2 Live Crew\'s commercial parody of
Roy Orbison\'s song, "Oh, Pretty Woman," **\*572** may be a fair use
within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, [17 U.S.C. § 107]()
(1988 ed. and Supp. IV). Although the District Court granted summary
judgment for 2 Live Crew, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding the
defense of fair use barred by the song\'s **\*\*1168** commercial
character and excessive borrowing. Because we hold that a parody\'s
commercial character is only one element to be weighed in a fair use
enquiry, and that insufficient consideration was given to the nature of
parody in weighing the degree of copying, we reverse and remand.

 

I

In 1964, Roy Orbison and William Dees wrote a rock ballad called "Oh,
Pretty Woman" and assigned their rights in it to respondent Acuff--Rose
Music, Inc. See Appendix A, *infra,* at 1179. Acuff--Rose registered the
song for copyright protection.

 

Petitioners Luther R. Campbell, Christopher Wongwon, Mark Ross, and
David Hobbs are collectively known as 2 Live Crew, a popular rap music
group.[]{#co_fnRef_B00021994058334_ID0EBSAI_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00021994058334_1) In 1989, Campbell wrote a
song entitled "Pretty Woman," which he later described in an affidavit
as intended, "through comical lyrics, to satirize the original
work\...." App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. On July 5, 1989, 2 Live Crew\'s
manager informed Acuff--Rose that 2 Live Crew had written a parody of
"Oh, Pretty Woman," that they would afford all credit for ownership and
authorship of the original song to Acuff--Rose, Dees, and Orbison, and
that they were willing to pay a fee for the use they wished to make of
it. Enclosed with the letter were a copy of the lyrics and a recording
of 2 Live Crew\'s song. See Appendix B, *infra,* at 1179--80.
Acuff--Rose\'s agent refused permission, stating that "I am aware of the
success **\*573** enjoyed by 'The 2 Live Crews\', but I must inform you
that we cannot permit the use of a parody of 'Oh, Pretty Woman.' " App.
to Pet. for Cert. 85a. Nonetheless, in June or July
1989,[]{#co_fnRef_B00031994058334_ID0EDUAI_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00031994058334_1) 2 Live Crew released
records, cassette tapes, and compact discs of "Pretty Woman" in a
collection of songs entitled "As Clean As They Wanna Be." The albums and
compact discs identify the authors of "Pretty Woman" as Orbison and Dees
and its publisher as Acuff--Rose.

 

Almost a year later, after nearly a quarter of a million copies of the
recording had been sold, Acuff--Rose sued 2 Live Crew and its record
company, Luke Skyywalker Records, for copyright infringement. The
District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live
Crew,[]{#co_fnRef_B00041994058334_ID0EVYAI_1
.anchor}[^3^](#co_footnote_B00041994058334_1) reasoning that the
commercial purpose of 2 Live Crew\'s song was no bar to fair use; that 2
Live Crew\'s version was a parody, which "quickly degenerates into a
play on words, substituting predictable lyrics with shocking ones" to
show "how bland and banal the Orbison song" is; that 2 Live Crew had
taken no more than was necessary to "conjure up" the original in order
to parody it; and that it was "extremely unlikely that 2 Live Crew\'s
song could adversely affect the market for the original." [754 F.Supp.
1150, 1154--1155, 1157--1158 (MD Tenn.1991)](). The District Court
weighed these factors and held that 2 Live Crew\'s song made fair use of
Orbison\'s original. [*Id.,* at 1158--1159.]()

 

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded. [972
F.2d 1429, 1439 (1992)](). Although it assumed for the purpose of its
opinion that 2 Live Crew\'s song **\*574** was a parody of the Orbison
original, the Court of Appeals thought the District Court had put too
little emphasis on the fact that "every commercial use \... is
presumptively \... unfair," [*Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City
Studios, Inc.,* 464 U.S. 417, 451, 104 S.Ct. 774, 792, 78 L.Ed.2d 574
(1984)](), and it held that "the admittedly commercial nature"
**\*\*1169** of the parody "requires the conclusion" that the first of
four factors relevant under the statute weighs against a finding of fair
use. [972 F.2d, at 1435, 1437.]() Next, the Court of Appeals determined
that, by "taking the heart of the original and making it the heart of a
new work," 2 Live Crew had, qualitatively, taken too much. [*Id.,* at
1438.]() Finally, after noting that the effect on the potential market
for the original (and the market for derivative works) is "undoubtedly
the single most important element of fair use," [*Harper & Row,
Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises,* 471 U.S. 539, 566, 105 S.Ct.
2218, 2233, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985)](), the Court of Appeals faulted the
District Court for "refus\[ing\] to indulge the presumption" that "harm
for purposes of the fair use analysis has been established by the
presumption attaching to commercial uses." [972 F.2d, at 1438--1439.]()
In sum, the court concluded that its "blatantly commercial purpose \...
prevents this parody from being a fair use." [*Id.,* at 1439.]()

 

We granted certiorari, [507 U.S. 1003, 113 S.Ct. 1642, 123 L.Ed.2d 264

be a fair use.

It is uncontested here that 2 Live Crew\'s song would be an infringement
of Acuff--Rose\'s rights in "Oh, Pretty Woman," under the Copyright Act
of 1976, [17 U.S.C. § 106]() (1988 ed. and Supp. IV), but for a finding
of fair use through parody.[]{#co_fnRef_B00051994058334_ID0EAFBI_1

explained, "\[i\]n truth, in literature, in science and in art, there
are, and can be, few, if any, things, which in an abstract sense, are
strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science
and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was
well known and used before." [*Emerson v. Davies,* 8 F.Cas. 615, 619

the inherent tension in the need simultaneously to protect copyrighted
material and to allow others to build upon it when he wrote, "while I
shall think myself bound to secure every man in the enjoyment of his
copy-right, one must not put manacles upon science." **\*576** *Carey v.
Kearsley,* 4 Esp. 168, 170, 170 Eng.Rep. 679, 681 (K.B.1803). In

6--17 (1985) (hereinafter Patry); Leval, [Toward a Fair Use Standard,

Congress meant [§ 107]() "to restate the present judicial doctrine of
fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way" and intended
that courts continue the common-law tradition of fair use adjudication.
[H.R.Rep. No. 94--1476, p. 66 (1976)]() (hereinafter House Report);
S.Rep. No. 94--473, p. 62 (1975) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, pp.
5659, 5679 (hereinafter Senate Report). The fair use doctrine thus
"permits \[and requires\] courts to avoid rigid application of the
copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity
which that law is designed to foster." [*Stewart v. Abend,* 495 U.S.
207, 236, 110 S.Ct. 1750, 1767, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990)]() (internal

[**^\[2\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F21994058334_1) The task is not to be
simplified with bright-line rules, for the statute, like the doctrine it
recognizes, calls for case-by-case analysis. [*Harper & Row,* 471 U.S.,

the examples given, [§ 101](); see [*Harper & Row, supra,* 471 U.S., at

[**^\[3\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F31994058334_1)
[**^\[4\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F41994058334_1) The first factor in a fair
use enquiry is "the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational
purposes." [§ 107(1)](). This factor draws on Justice Story\'s
formulation, "the nature and objects of the selections made." [*Folsom
v. Marsh, supra,* at 348.]() The enquiry here may be guided by the
examples given in the preamble to [§ 107](), looking to whether the use
is for criticism, or comment, or news reporting, **\*579** and the like,
see [§ 107](). The central purpose of this investigation is to see, in
Justice Story\'s words, whether the new work merely "supersede\[s\] the
objects" of the original creation, [*Folsom v. Marsh, supra,* at 348;]()
accord, [*Harper & Row, supra,* 471 U.S., at 562, 105 S.Ct., at 2231]()
("supplanting" the original), or instead adds something new, with a
further purpose or different character, altering the first with new
expression, meaning, or message; it asks, in other words, whether and to
what extent the new work is "transformative." Leval 1111. Although such
transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair
use, [*Sony, supra,* 464 U.S., at 455, n. 40, 104 S.Ct., at 795, n.
40,]()[]{#co_fnRef_B00121994058334_ID0EWKCI_1
.anchor}[^11^](#co_footnote_B00121994058334_1) the goal of copyright, to
promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of
transformative works. Such works thus lie at the heart of the fair use
doctrine\'s guarantee of breathing space within the confines of
copyright, see, *e.g.,* [*Sony, supra,* at 478--480, 104 S.Ct., at
807--808]() (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting), and the more transformative the
new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like
commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.

 

[**^\[5\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F51994058334_1) This Court has only once
before even considered whether parody may be fair use, and that time
issued no opinion because of the Court\'s equal division. [*Benny v.
Loew\'s Inc.,* 239 F.2d 532 (CA9 1956)](), aff\'d *sub nom.* [*Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Loew\'s Inc.,* 356 U.S. 43, 78 S.Ct. 667, 2
L.Ed.2d 583 (1958)](). Suffice it to say now that parody has an obvious
claim to transformative value, as Acuff--Rose itself does not deny. Like
less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can provide social
benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process,
creating a new one. We thus line up with the courts that have held that
parody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair use under [§
107](). See, *e.g.,* [*Fisher v. Dees,* 794 F.2d 432 (CA9 1986)]()
("When Sonny Sniffs Glue," a parody of "When Sunny Gets Blue," is fair
use); **\*580** [*Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co.,* 482
F.Supp. 741 SDNY)](), aff\'d, [623 F.2d 252 (CA2 1980)]() ("I Love
Sodom," a "Saturday **\*\*1172** Night Live" television parody of "I
Love New York," is fair use); see also House Report, p. 65; Senate
Report, p. 61, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, pp. 5659, 5678
("\[U\]se in a parody of some of the content of the work parodied" may
be fair use).

 

[**^\[6\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F61994058334_1) The germ of parody lies in
the definition of the Greek *parodeia,* quoted in Judge Nelson\'s Court
of Appeals dissent, as "a song sung alongside another." [972 F.2d, at
1440,]() quoting 7 Encyclopedia Britannica 768 (15th ed. 1975). Modern
dictionaries accordingly describe a parody as a "literary or artistic
work that imitates the characteristic style of an author or a work for
comic effect or ridicule,"[]{#co_fnRef_B00131994058334_ID0ERTCI_1
.anchor}[^12^](#co_footnote_B00131994058334_1) or as a "composition in
prose or verse in which the characteristic turns of thought and phrase
in an author or class of authors are imitated in such a way as to make
them appear ridiculous."[]{#co_fnRef_B00141994058334_ID0EAUCI_1
.anchor}[^13^](#co_footnote_B00141994058334_1) For the purposes of
copyright law, the nub of the definitions, and the heart of any
parodist\'s claim to quote from existing material, is the use of some
elements of a prior author\'s composition to create a new one that, at
least in part, comments on that author\'s works. See, *e.g.,* [*Fisher
v. Dees, supra,* at 437;]() [*MCA, Inc. v. Wilson,* 677 F.2d 180, 185
(CA2 1981)](). If, on the contrary, the commentary has no critical
bearing on the substance or style of the original composition, which the
alleged infringer merely uses to get attention or to avoid the drudgery
in working up something fresh, the claim to fairness in borrowing from
another\'s work diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and
other factors, like the extent of its commerciality, loom
larger.[]{#co_fnRef_B00151994058334_ID0E6VCI_1
.anchor}[^14^](#co_footnote_B00151994058334_1) Parody needs to mimic
**\*581** an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use
the creation of its victim\'s (or collective victims\') imagination,
whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires
justification for the very act of
borrowing.[]{#co_fnRef_B00161994058334_ID0ENWCI_1
.anchor}[^15^](#co_footnote_B00161994058334_1) See [*ibid.;*]()

Into a Juggling Act, in ASCAP, Copyright Law Symposium, No. 34, p. 25
(1987).

 

The fact that parody can claim legitimacy for some appropriation does
not, of course, tell either parodist or judge much about where to draw
the line. Like a book review quoting the copyrighted material
criticized, parody may or may not be fair use, and petitioners\'
suggestion that any parodic use is presumptively fair has no more
justification in law or fact than the equally hopeful claim that any use
for news reporting should be presumed fair, see [*Harper & Row,* 471
U.S., at 561, 105 S.Ct., at 2230.]() The Act has no hint of an
evidentiary preference for parodists over their victims, and no workable
presumption for parody could take account of the fact that parody often
shades into satire when society is lampooned through its creative
artifacts, or that a work may contain both parodic and nonparodic
elements. Accordingly, parody, like any other use, has to work its way
through the relevant factors, and be judged case by case, in light of
the ends of the copyright law.

 

Here, the District Court held, and the Court of Appeals assumed, that 2
Live **\*\*1173** Crew\'s "Pretty Woman" contains parody, **\*582**
commenting on and criticizing the original work, whatever it may have to
say about society at large. As the District Court remarked, the words of
2 Live Crew\'s song copy the original\'s first line, but then "quickly
degenerat\[e\] into a play on words, substituting predictable lyrics
with shocking ones \... \[that\] derisively demonstrat\[e\] how bland
and banal the Orbison song seems to them." [754 F.Supp., at 1155]()
(footnote omitted). Judge Nelson, dissenting below, came to the same
conclusion, that the 2 Live Crew song "was clearly intended to ridicule
the white-bread original" and "reminds us that sexual congress with
nameless streetwalkers is not necessarily the stuff of romance and is
not necessarily without its consequences. The singers (there are
several) have the same thing on their minds as did the lonely man with
the nasal voice, but here there is no hint of wine and roses." [972
F.2d, at 1442.]() Although the majority below had difficulty discerning
any criticism of the original in 2 Live Crew\'s song, it assumed for
purposes of its opinion that there was some. [*Id.,* at 1435--1436, and
n. 8.]()

 

[**^\[7\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F71994058334_1) We have less difficulty in
finding that critical element in 2 Live Crew\'s song than the Court of
Appeals did, although having found it we will not take the further step
of evaluating its quality. The threshold question when fair use is
raised in defense of parody is whether a parodic character may
reasonably be perceived.[]{#co_fnRef_B00171994058334_ID0EZADI_1
.anchor}[^16^](#co_footnote_B00171994058334_1) Whether, going beyond
that, parody is in good taste or bad does not and should not matter to
fair use. As Justice Holmes explained, "\[i\]t would be a dangerous
undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves
final judges of the worth of \[a work\], outside of the narrowest and
most obvious limits. At **\*583** the one extreme some works of genius
would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them
repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their
author spoke." [*Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.,* 188 U.S.
239, 251, 23 S.Ct. 298, 300, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903)]() (circus posters have
copyright protection); cf. [*Yankee Publishing Inc. v. News America
Publishing, Inc.,* 809 F.Supp. 267, 280 (SDNY 1992)]() (Leval, J.)
("First Amendment protections do not apply only to those who speak
clearly, whose jokes are funny, and whose parodies succeed") (trademark
case).

 

While we might not assign a high rank to the parodic element here, we
think it fair to say that 2 Live Crew\'s song reasonably could be
perceived as commenting on the original or criticizing it, to some
degree. 2 Live Crew juxtaposes the romantic musings of a man whose
fantasy comes true, with degrading taunts, a bawdy demand for sex, and a
sigh of relief from paternal responsibility. The later words can be
taken as a comment on the naiveté of the original of an earlier day, as
a rejection of its sentiment that ignores the ugliness of street life
and the debasement that it signifies. It is this joinder of reference
and ridicule that marks off the author\'s choice of parody from the
other types of comment and criticism that traditionally have had a claim
to fair use protection as transformative
works.[]{#co_fnRef_B00181994058334_ID0E6EDI_1
.anchor}[^17^](#co_footnote_B00181994058334_1)

 

[**^\[8\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F81994058334_1)
[**^\[9\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F91994058334_1) The Court of Appeals,
however, immediately cut short the enquiry into 2 Live Crew\'s fair use
claim by confining its treatment of the first factor essentially to one
relevant fact, the commercial nature of the use. The court then inflated
the significance of this fact by applying a presumption ostensibly
**\*584** **\*\*1174** culled from *Sony,* that "every commercial use of
copyrighted material is presumptively \... unfair\...." [*Sony,* 464
U.S., at 451, 104 S.Ct., at 792.]() In giving virtually dispositive
weight to the commercial nature of the parody, the Court of Appeals
erred.

 

The language of the statute makes clear that the commercial or nonprofit
educational purpose of a work is only one element of the first factor
enquiry into its purpose and character. [Section 107(1)]() uses the term
"including" to begin the dependent clause referring to commercial use,
and the main clause speaks of a broader investigation into "purpose and
character." As we explained in *Harper & Row,* Congress resisted
attempts to narrow the ambit of this traditional enquiry by adopting
categories of presumptively fair use, and it urged courts to preserve
the breadth of their traditionally ample view of the universe of
relevant evidence. [471 U.S., at 561, 105 S.Ct. at 2230;]() House
Report, p. 66, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, pp. 5659, 5679.
Accordingly, the mere fact that a use is educational and not for profit
does not insulate it from a finding of infringement, any more than the
commercial character of a use bars a finding of fairness. If, indeed,
commerciality carried presumptive force against a finding of fairness,
the presumption would swallow nearly all of the illustrative uses listed
in the preamble paragraph of [§ 107](), including news reporting,
comment, criticism, teaching, scholarship, and research, since these
activities "are generally conducted for profit in this country."
[*Harper & Row, supra,* at 592, 105 S.Ct., at 2246]() (Brennan, J.,
dissenting). Congress could not have intended such a rule, which
certainly is not inferable from the common-law cases, arising as they
did from the world of letters in which Samuel Johnson could pronounce
that "\[n\]o man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money." 3
Boswell\'s Life of Johnson 19 (G. Hill ed. 1934).

 

*Sony* itself called for no hard evidentiary presumption. There, we
emphasized the need for a "sensitive balancing of interests," [464 U.S.,
at 455, n. 40, 104 S.Ct., at 795, n. 40,]() noted that Congress had
"eschewed a rigid, bright-line approach to fair use," **\*585** [*id.,*
at 449, n. 31, 104 S.Ct., at 792, n. 31,]() and stated that the
commercial or nonprofit educational character of a work is "not
conclusive," [*id.,* at 448--449, 104 S.Ct., at 792,]() but rather a
fact to be "weighed along with other\[s\] in fair use decisions,"
[*id.,* at 449, n. 32, 104 S.Ct. at 792, n. 32, (quoting House Report,
p. 66)]() U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, pp. 5659, 5679. The Court of
Appeals\'s elevation of one sentence from *Sony* to a *per se* rule thus
runs as much counter to *Sony* itself as to the long common-law
tradition of fair use adjudication. Rather, as we explained in *[Harper
& Row,]() Sony* stands for the proposition that the "fact that a
publication was commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor
that tends to weigh against a finding of fair use." [471 U.S., at 562,
105 S.Ct., at 2231.]() But that is all, and the fact that even the force
of that tendency will vary with the context is a further reason against
elevating commerciality to hard presumptive significance. The use, for
example, of a copyrighted work to advertise a product, even in a parody,
will be entitled to less indulgence under the first factor of the fair
use enquiry than the sale of a parody for its own sake, let alone one
performed a single time by students in school. See generally Patry &
Perlmutter 679--680; [*Fisher v. Dees,* 794 F.2d, at 437;]()

**\*586** **\*\*1175** B

[**^\[10\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F101994058334_1) The second statutory
factor, "the nature of the copyrighted work," [§ 107(2)](), draws on
Justice Story\'s expression, the "value of the materials used." [*Folsom
v. Marsh,* 9 F.Cas., at 348.]() This factor calls for recognition that
some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than
others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to
establish when the former works are copied. See, *e.g.,* [*Stewart v.
Abend,* 495 U.S., at 237--238, 110 S.Ct., at 1768--1769]() (contrasting
fictional short story with factual works); [*Harper & Row,* 471 U.S., at
563--564, 105 S.Ct., at 2231--2233]() (contrasting soon-to-be-published
memoir with published speech); [*Sony,* 464 U.S., at 455, n. 40, 104
S.Ct., at 792, n. 40]() (contrasting motion pictures with news
broadcasts); [*Feist,* 499 U.S., at 348--351, 111 S.Ct., at
1289--1291]() (contrasting creative works with bare factual
compilations); 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §
13.05\[A\]\[2\] (1993) (hereinafter Nimmer); Leval 1116. We agree with
both the District Court and the Court of Appeals that the Orbison
original\'s creative expression for public dissemination falls within
the core of the copyright\'s protective purposes. [754 F.Supp., at
1155--1156;]() [972 F.2d, at 1437.]() This fact, however, is not much
help in this case, or ever likely to help much in separating the fair
use sheep from the infringing goats in a parody case, since parodies
almost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works.

 

C

[**^\[11\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F111994058334_1) The third factor asks
whether "the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation
to the copyrighted work as a whole," [§ 107(3)]() (or, in Justice
Story\'s words, "the quantity and value of the materials used," [*Folsom
v. Marsh, supra,* at 348)]() are reasonable in relation to the purpose
of the copying. Here, attention turns to the persuasiveness of a
parodist\'s justification for the particular copying done, and the
enquiry will harken back to the first of the statutory factors, for, as
in prior cases, we recognize that the extent of permissible copying
varies with the purpose and character **\*587** of the use. See [*Sony,
supra,* 464 U.S., at 449--450, 104 S.Ct., at 792--793]() (reproduction
of entire work "does not have its ordinary effect of militating against
a finding of fair use" as to home videotaping of television programs);
[*Harper & Row, supra,* 471 U.S., at 564, 105 S.Ct., at 2232]()
("\[E\]ven substantial quotations might qualify as fair use in a review
of a published work or a news account of a speech" but not in a scoop of
a soon-to-be-published memoir). The facts bearing on this factor will
also tend to address the fourth, by revealing the degree to which the
parody may serve as a market substitute for the original or potentially
licensed derivatives. See Leval 1123.

 

The District Court considered the song\'s parodic purpose in finding
that 2 Live Crew had not helped themselves overmuch. [754 F.Supp., at
1156--1157.]() The Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that "\[w\]hile
it may not be inappropriate to find that no more was taken than
necessary, the copying was qualitatively substantial\.... We conclude
that taking the heart of the original and making it the heart of a new
work was to purloin a substantial portion of the essence of the
original." [972 F.2d, at 1438.]()

 

The Court of Appeals is of course correct that this factor calls for
thought not only about the quantity of the materials used, but about
their quality and importance, too. In *Harper & Row,* for example, the
Nation had taken only some 300 words out of President Ford\'s memoirs,
but we signaled the significance of the quotations in finding them to
amount to "the heart of the book," the part most likely to be newsworthy
and important in licensing serialization. [471 U.S., at 564--566, 568,
105 S.Ct., at 2232--2234, 2234]() (internal quotation marks omitted). We
also agree with the Court of Appeals that whether "a substantial portion
of the infringing work **\*\*1176** was copied verbatim" from the
copyrighted work is a relevant question, see [*id.,* at 565, 105 S.Ct.,
at 2232,]() for it may reveal a dearth of transformative character or
purpose under the first factor, or a greater likelihood of market harm
under the fourth; a work composed primarily of an original, particularly
its heart, with little added or changed, **\*588** is more likely to be
a merely superseding use, fulfilling demand for the original.

 

Where we part company with the court below is in applying these guides
to parody, and in particular to parody in the song before us. Parody
presents a difficult case. Parody\'s humor, or in any event its comment,
necessarily springs from recognizable allusion to its object through
distorted imitation. Its art lies in the tension between a known
original and its parodic twin. When parody takes aim at a particular
original work, the parody must be able to "conjure up" at least enough
of that original to make the object of its critical wit recognizable.
See, *e.g.,* [*Elsmere Music,* 623 F.2d, at 253, n. 1;]() [*Fisher v.
Dees,* 794 F.2d, at 438--439.]() What makes for this recognition is
quotation of the original\'s most distinctive or memorable features,
which the parodist can be sure the audience will know. Once enough has
been taken to assure identification, how much more is reasonable will
depend, say, on the extent to which the song\'s overriding purpose and
character is to parody the original or, in contrast, the likelihood that
the parody may serve as a market substitute for the original. But using
some characteristic features cannot be avoided.

 

[**^\[12\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F121994058334_1) We think the Court of
Appeals was insufficiently appreciative of parody\'s need for the
recognizable sight or sound when it ruled 2 Live Crew\'s use
unreasonable as a matter of law. It is true, of course, that 2 Live Crew
copied the characteristic opening bass riff (or musical phrase) of the
original, and true that the words of the first line copy the Orbison
lyrics. But if quotation of the opening riff and the first line may be
said to go to the "heart" of the original, the heart is also what most
readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which
parody takes aim. Copying does not become excessive in relation to
parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the original\'s
heart. If 2 Live Crew had copied a significantly less memorable part of
the original, it is difficult to see how its parodic character **\*589**
would have come through. See [*Fisher v. Dees, supra,* at 439.]()

 

[**^\[13\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F131994058334_1) This is not, of course, to
say that anyone who calls himself a parodist can skim the cream and get
away scot free. In parody, as in news reporting, see *Harper & Row,
supra,* context is everything, and the question of fairness asks what
else the parodist did besides go to the heart of the original. It is
significant that 2 Live Crew not only copied the first line of the
original, but thereafter departed markedly from the Orbison lyrics for
its own ends. 2 Live Crew not only copied the bass riff and repeated
it,[]{#co_fnRef_B00201994058334_ID0E5NAK_1
.anchor}[^19^](#co_footnote_B00201994058334_1) but also produced
otherwise distinctive sounds, interposing "scraper" noise, overlaying
the music with solos in different keys, and altering the drum beat. See
[754 F.Supp., at 1155.]() This is not a case, then, where "a substantial
portion" of the parody itself is composed of a "verbatim" copying of the
original. It is not, that is, a case where the parody is so
insubstantial, as compared to the copying, that the third factor must be
resolved as a matter of law against the parodists.

 

Suffice it to say here that, as to the lyrics, we think the Court of
Appeals correctly suggested that "no more was taken than necessary,"
[972 F.2d, at 1438,]() but just for that reason, we fail to see how the
copying can be excessive in relation to its parodic purpose, even if the
portion taken is the original\'s "heart." As to the music, we express no
opinion whether repetition of the bass riff is excessive copying, and we
remand to permit **\*\*1177** evaluation of the amount taken, in light
of the song\'s parodic purpose and character, its transformative
elements, and considerations of the potential for market substitution
sketched more fully below.

 

**\*590** D

[**^\[14\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F141994058334_1) The fourth fair use factor
is "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work." [§ 107(4)](). It requires courts to consider not only
the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the
alleged infringer, but also "whether unrestricted and widespread conduct
of the sort engaged in by the defendant \... would result in a
substantially adverse impact on the potential market" for the original.
Nimmer § 13.05\[A\] \[4\], p. 13--102.61 (footnote omitted); accord,
[*Harper & Row,* 471 U.S., at 569, 105 S.Ct., at 2235;]() Senate Report,
p. 65; [*Folsom v. Marsh,* 9 F.Cas., at 349.]() The enquiry "must take
account not only of harm to the original but also of harm to the market
for derivative works." [*Harper & Row, supra,* 471 U.S. at 568, 105
S.Ct., at 2234.]()

 

[**^\[15\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F151994058334_1) Since fair use is an
affirmative defense,[]{#co_fnRef_B00211994058334_ID0EHWAK_1
.anchor}[^20^](#co_footnote_B00211994058334_1) its proponent would have
difficulty carrying the burden of demonstrating fair use without
favorable evidence about relevant
markets.[]{#co_fnRef_B00221994058334_ID0EQWAK_1
.anchor}[^21^](#co_footnote_B00221994058334_1) In moving for summary
judgment, 2 Live Crew left themselves at just such a disadvantage when
they failed to address the effect on the market for rap derivatives, and
confined themselves to uncontroverted submissions that there was no
likely effect on the market for the original. They did not, however,
thereby subject themselves to the evidentiary presumption applied by the
Court of Appeals. In assessing the likelihood of significant market
harm, the Court of Appeals **\*591** quoted from language in *Sony* that
" '\[i\]f the intended use is for commercial gain, that likelihood may
be presumed. But if it is for a noncommercial purpose, the likelihood
must be demonstrated.' " [972 F.2d, at 1438,]() quoting [*Sony,* 464
U.S., at 451, 104 S.Ct., at 104 S.Ct., at 793.]() The court reasoned
that because "the use of the copyrighted work is wholly commercial, \...
we presume that a likelihood of future harm to Acuff--Rose exists." [972
F.2d, at 1438.]() In so doing, the court resolved the fourth factor
against 2 Live Crew, just as it had the first, by applying a presumption
about the effect of commercial use, a presumption which as applied here
we hold to be error.

 

No "presumption" or inference of market harm that might find support in
*Sony* is applicable to a case involving something beyond mere
duplication for commercial purposes. [*Sony*\'s]() discussion of a
presumption contrasts a context of verbatim copying of the original in
its entirety for commercial purposes, with the noncommercial context of
*Sony* itself (home copying of television programming). In the former
circumstances, what *Sony* said simply makes common sense: when a
commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of an
original, it clearly "supersede\[s\] the objects," [*Folsom v. Marsh,
supra,* at 348,]() of the original and serves as a market replacement
for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original
will occur. [*Sony, supra,* 464 U.S., at 451, 104 S.Ct., at 793.]() But
when, on the contrary, the second use is transformative, market
substitution is at least less certain, and market harm may not be so
readily inferred. Indeed, as to parody pure and simple, it is more
likely that the new work will not affect the market for the original in
a way cognizable under this factor, that is, by acting as a substitute
for it ("supersed\[ing\] **\*\*1178** \[its\] objects"). See Leval 1125;
Patry & Perlmutter 692, 697--698. This is so because the parody and the
original usually serve different market functions. Bisceglia, ASCAP,
Copyright Law Symposium, No. 34, at 23.

 

[**^\[16\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F161994058334_1) We do not, of course,
suggest that a parody may not harm the market at all, but when a lethal
parody, like a scathing **\*592** theater review, kills demand for the
original, it does not produce a harm cognizable under the Copyright Act.
Because "parody may quite legitimately aim at garroting the original,
destroying it commercially as well as artistically," B. Kaplan, An
Unhurried View of Copyright 69 (1967), the role of the courts is to
distinguish between "\[b\]iting criticism \[that merely\] suppresses
demand \[and\] copyright infringement\[, which\] usurps it." [*Fisher v.
Dees,* 794 F.2d, at 438.]()

 

This distinction between potentially remediable displacement and
unremediable disparagement is reflected in the rule that there is no
protectible derivative market for criticism. The market for potential
derivative uses includes only those that creators of original works
would in general develop or license others to develop. Yet the
unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical
reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the
very notion of a potential licensing market. "People ask \... for
criticism, but they only want praise." S. Maugham, Of Human Bondage 241
(Penguin ed. 1992). Thus, to the extent that the opinion below may be
read to have considered harm to the market for parodies of "Oh, Pretty
Woman," see [972 F.2d, at 1439,]() the court erred. Accord, [*Fisher v.
Dees, supra,* at 437;]() Leval 1125; Patry & Perlmutter
688--691.[]{#co_fnRef_B00231994058334_ID0E3FBK_1

[**^\[17\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F171994058334_1)
[**^\[18\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F181994058334_1) In explaining why the law
recognizes no derivative market for critical works, including parody, we
have, of course, been speaking of the later work as if it had nothing
but a critical aspect (*i.e.,* "parody pure and simple," *supra,* at
1177). But the later work may have a more complex character, with
effects not only in the arena of criticism but also in protectible
markets for derivative works, too. In that sort of case, the law looks
beyond the criticism to the other elements of the work, as it does here.
2 Live Crew\'s song comprises not **\*593** only parody but also rap
music, and the derivative market for rap music is a proper focus of
enquiry, see [*Harper & Row, supra,* 471 U.S., at 568, 105 S.Ct., at
2234;]() Nimmer § 13.05 \[B\]. Evidence of substantial harm to it would
weigh against a finding of fair
use,[]{#co_fnRef_B00241994058334_ID0EXIBK_1
.anchor}[^23^](#co_footnote_B00241994058334_1) because the licensing of
derivatives is an important economic incentive to the creation of
originals. See [17 U.S.C. § 106(2)]() (copyright owner has rights to
derivative works). Of course, the only harm to derivatives that need
concern us, as discussed above, is the harm of market substitution. The
fact that a parody may impair the market for derivative uses by the very
effectiveness of its critical commentary is no more relevant under
copyright than the like threat to the original
market.[]{#co_fnRef_B00251994058334_ID0E1JBK_1
.anchor}[^24^](#co_footnote_B00251994058334_1)

 

[**^\[19\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F191994058334_1) Although 2 Live Crew
submitted uncontroverted affidavits on the question of market harm to
the original, neither they, nor Acuff--Rose, introduced evidence or
affidavits addressing the likely effect of 2 Live Crew\'s parodic rap
song on the market for a nonparody, rap version of "Oh, Pretty Woman."
And while Acuff--Rose would have us find evidence of a rap market in the
very facts that 2 Live Crew recorded a rap parody of "Oh, Pretty Woman"
and another rap group sought a license to record a rap derivative,
**\*\*1179** there was no evidence that a potential rap market was
harmed in any way by 2 Live Crew\'s parody, rap version. The fact that 2
Live Crew\'s parody sold as part of a collection of rap songs says very
little about the parody\'s effect on a market for a rap version of the
original, either of the music alone or of the music with its lyrics. The
District Court essentially passed **\*594** on this issue, observing
that Acuff--Rose is free to record "whatever version of the original it
desires," [754 F.Supp., at 1158;]() the Court of Appeals went the other
way by erroneous presumption. Contrary to each treatment, it is
impossible to deal with the fourth factor except by recognizing that a
silent record on an important factor bearing on fair use disentitled the
proponent of the defense, 2 Live Crew, to summary judgment. The
evidentiary hole will doubtless be plugged on remand.

 

III

It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the commercial
nature of 2 Live Crew\'s parody of "Oh, Pretty Woman" rendered it
presumptively unfair. No such evidentiary presumption is available to
address either the first factor, the character and purpose of the use,
or the fourth, market harm, in determining whether a transformative use,
such as parody, is a fair one. The court also erred in holding that 2
Live Crew had necessarily copied excessively from the Orbison original,
considering the parodic purpose of the use. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

 

*It is so ordered.*

Justice [KENNEDY](), concurring.

I agree that remand is appropriate and join the opinion of the Court,
with these further observations about the fair use analysis of parody.

 

The common-law method instated by the fair use provision of the
copyright statute, [17 U.S.C. § 107]() (1988 ed. and Supp. IV), presumes
that rules will emerge from the course of decisions. I agree that
certain general principles are now discernible to define the fair use
exception for parody. One of these rules, as the Court observes, is that
parody may qualify as fair use regardless of whether it is published or
performed **\*597** for profit. *Ante,* at 1178. Another is that parody
may qualify as fair use only if it draws upon the original composition
to make humorous or ironic commentary about that same composition.
*Ante,* at 1172. It is not enough that the parody use the original in a
humorous fashion, however creative that humor may be. The parody must
target the original, and not just its general style, the genre of art to
which it belongs, or society as a whole (although if it targets the
original, it may target those features as well). See [*Rogers v. Koons,*
960 F.2d 301, 310 (CA2 1992)]() ("\[T\]hough the satire need not be only
of the copied work and may \... also be a parody of modern society, the
copied work must be, at least in part, an object of the parody");
[*Fisher v. Dees,* 794 F.2d 432, 436 (CA9 1986)]() ("\[A\] humorous or
satiric work deserves protection under the fair-use doctrine only if the
copied work is at least partly the target of the work in question").
This prerequisite confines fair use protection to works whose very
subject is the original composition and so necessitates some borrowing
from it. See [*MCA, Inc. v. Wilson,* 677 F.2d 180, 185 (CA2 1981)]()
("\[I\]f the copyrighted song is not at least in part an object of the
parody, there is no need to conjure it up"); Bisceglia, Parody and
Copyright Protection: Turning the Balancing Act Into a Juggling Act, in
ASCAP, Copyright Law Symposium, No. 34, pp. 23--29 (1987). It also
protects works we have reason to fear will not be licensed by copyright
holders who wish to shield their works from criticism. See *Fisher,
supra,* at 437 ("Self-esteem is seldom strong enough to permit the
granting of permission even in exchange for a reasonable fee"); Posner,
When Is Parody Fair Use?, 21 J. Legal Studies 67, 73 (1992) ("There is
an obstruction when the parodied work is a target of the parodist\'s
criticism, for it may be in the private interest of the copyright owner,
but not in the social interest, to suppress criticism of the work")
(emphasis deleted).

 

If we keep the definition of parody within these limits, we have gone
most of the way towards satisfying the four-factor **\*598** fair use
test in [§ 107](). The first factor (the purpose and character of use)
itself concerns the definition of parody. The second factor (the nature
of the copyrighted work) adds little to the first, since "parodies
almost invariably **\*\*1181** copy publicly known, expressive works."
*Ante,* at 1175. The third factor (the amount and substantiality of the
portion used in relation to the whole) is likewise subsumed within the
definition of parody. In determining whether an alleged parody has taken
too much, the target of the parody is what gives content to the inquiry.
Some parodies, by their nature, require substantial copying. See
[*Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co.,* 623 F.2d 252 (CA2
1980)]() (holding that "I Love Sodom" skit on "Saturday Night Live" is
legitimate parody of the "I Love New York" campaign). Other parodies,
like Lewis Carroll\'s "You Are Old, Father William," need only take
parts of the original composition. The third factor does reinforce the
principle that courts should not accord fair use protection to
profiteers who do no more than add a few silly words to someone else\'s
song or place the characters from a familiar work in novel or eccentric
poses. See, *e.g.,* [*Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates,* 581 F.2d
751 (CA9 1978)](); [*DC Comics Inc. v. Unlimited Monkey Business, Inc.,*
598 F.Supp. 110 (ND Ga.1984)](). But, as I believe the Court
acknowledges, *ante,* at 1176--77, it is by no means a test of
mechanical application. In my view, it serves in effect to ensure
compliance with the targeting requirement.

 

As to the fourth factor (the effect of the use on the market for the
original), the Court acknowledges that it is legitimate for parody to
suppress demand for the original by its critical effect. *Ante,* at
1177--78. What it may not do is usurp demand by its substitutive effect.
[*Ibid.*]() It will be difficult, of course, for courts to determine
whether harm to the market results from a parody\'s critical or
substitutive effects. But again, if we keep the definition of parody
within appropriate bounds, this inquiry may be of little significance.
If a work targets another for humorous or ironic effect, it is by
definition **\*599** a new creative work. Creative works can compete
with other creative works for the same market, even if their appeal is
overlapping. Factor four thus underscores the importance of ensuring
that the parody is in fact an independent creative work, which is why
the parody must "make some critical comment or statement about the
original work which reflects the original perspective of the
parodist---thereby giving the parody social value beyond its
entertainment function." [*Metro--Goldwyn--Mayer, Inc. v. Showcase
Atlanta Cooperative Productions, Inc.,* 479 F.Supp. 351, 357 (ND
Ga.1979)]().

 

The fair use factors thus reinforce the importance of keeping the
definition of parody within proper limits. More than arguable parodic
content should be required to deem a would-be parody a fair use. Fair
use is an affirmative defense, so doubts about whether a given use is
fair should not be resolved in favor of the self-proclaimed parodist. We
should not make it easy for musicians to exploit existing works and then
later claim that their rendition was a valuable commentary on the
original. Almost any revamped modern version of a familiar composition
can be construed as a "comment on the naiveté of the original," *ante,*
at 1173, because of the difference in style and because it will be
amusing to hear how the old tune sounds in the new genre. Just the
thought of a rap version of Beethoven\'s Fifth Symphony or "Achy Breaky
Heart" is bound to make people smile. If we allow any weak
transformation to qualify as parody, however, we weaken the protection
of copyright. And underprotection of copyright disserves the goals of
copyright just as much as overprotection, by reducing the financial
incentive to create.

 

The Court decides it is "fair to say that 2 Live Crew\'s song reasonably
could be perceived as commenting on the original or criticizing it, to
some degree." *Ibid.* (applying the first fair use factor). While I am
not so assured that 2 Live Crew\'s song is a legitimate parody, the
Court\'s treatment of **\*600** the **\*\*1182** remaining factors
leaves room for the District Court to determine on remand that the song
is not a fair use. As future courts apply our fair use analysis, they
must take care to ensure that not just any commercial takeoff is
rationalized *post hoc* as a parody.

 

With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.
