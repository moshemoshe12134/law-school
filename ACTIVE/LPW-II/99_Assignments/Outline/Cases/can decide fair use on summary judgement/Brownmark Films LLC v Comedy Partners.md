**Synopsis**

**Background:** Production company brought action against television
broadcast company for infringement of its copyright in music video. The
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, J.P.
[Stadtmueller](), J., [800 F.Supp.2d 991,]() dismissed action. Plaintiff
appealed.

 

**Holdings:** The Court of Appeals, [Cudahy](), Circuit Judge, held
that:

 

[^\[1\]^](#co_anchor_F32027859046_1) district court properly could
dismiss suit on basis of affirmative defense at early stage of
proceedings;

 

[^\[2\]^](#co_anchor_F62027859046_1) plaintiff waived argument of
whether district court had erred in its fair use determination;

 

[^\[3\]^](#co_anchor_F82027859046_1) accused work had obvious
transformative value;

 

[^\[4\]^](#co_anchor_F92027859046_1) fair use factor regarding creative
and expressive nature of copyrighted video offered little help to owner
with regard to parody;

 

[^\[5\]^](#co_anchor_F102027859046_1) extensive copying did not weigh
against fair use; and

 

[^\[6\]^](#co_anchor_F112027859046_1) parody could not have actionable
effect on potential market for, or value of, copyrighted video.

 

Affirmed.

 

**Procedural Posture(s):** On Appeal; Motion to Dismiss; Motion to
Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim.

Circuit Judges.

**Opinion**

[CUDAHY](), Circuit Judge.

This is a case about how a court may dispose of a copyright infringement
action based on the fair use affirmative defense while avoiding the
burdens of discovery and trial. This case also poses the interesting
question of whether the incorporation-by-reference doctrine applies to
audio-visual works.

 

*South Park* is a popular animated television show intended for mature
audiences. The show centers on the adventures of foul-mouthed fourth
graders in the small town of South Park, Colorado. It is notorious for
its distinct animation style and scatological humor. The show frequently
provides commentary on current events and pop-culture through parody and
satire. Previous episodes have dealt with the Florida Recount, the
aftermath of hurricane Katrina and the phenomenon of celebrity sex
tapes.

 

This case involves one episode entitled "Canada On Strike," which
satirized the 2007--2008 Writers\' Guild of America strike, inexplicably
popular viral videos and the difficulty of monetizing Internet fame. In
the episode, the nation of Canada goes on strike, demanding a share of
the "Internet money" they believe is being generated by viral videos and
other online content. The South Park Elementary school boys---Cartman,
Stan, Kyle and Butters---decide to create a viral video in order to
accrue enough "Internet money" to buy off the striking Canadians. The
boys create a video, "What What (In The Butt)," (WWITB) in which Butters
sings a paean to anal sex. Within the show, the video is a huge hit, but
the boys are only able to earn "theoretical dollars."

 

This video is a parody of a real world viral video of the same name,
featuring an adult male singing and dancing in tight pants. The two
versions of WWITB are very similar. The *South Park* version recreates a
large portion of the original version, using the same angles, framing,
dance moves and visual elements. However, the *South Park* version stars
Butters, a naïve nine-year old, in a variety of costumes drawing
attention to his innocence: at various points he is dressed as a teddy
bear, an astronaut and a daisy.

 

Brownmark Films, LLC (Brownmark), the copyright holder for the original
WWITB video, filed suit against South Park Digital Studios (SPDS) and
others for copyright infringement under the Copyright Act of 1976, [17
U.S.C. § 101 *et seq.*]() Brownmark\'s complaint referenced both
versions of WWITB, but it did not attach either work to the complaint.
SPDS responded claiming the *South Park* version was clearly fair use
under [§ 107](), attached the two works and moved for dismissal for
failure to state a claim under [Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)](). Brownmark did
not address the substance of SPDS\'s fair use defense, but instead
argued that the court could not consider fair use on a 12(b)(6) motion
to dismiss. The district court concluded that "\[o\]ne only needs to
take a fleeting glance at the South Park episode" to determine that its
use of the WWITB video is meant "to lampoon the recent craze in our
society of watching video clips on the internet \... of rather low
artistic sophistication and quality"---in other words, fair use. The
court granted SPDS\'s motion to dismiss based on the fair use
affirmative defense.

 

**\*690** Brownmark appeals, arguing that an unpleaded affirmative
defense of fair use is an improper basis for granting a motion to
dismiss under [Rule 12(b)(6)](), and that in any event, SPDS\'s WWITB
video is not a fair use of the original WWITB video. We hold that the
district court could properly decide fair use on SPDS\'s motion, and we
affirm the district court\'s finding of fair use.

[**^\[1\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F12027859046_1)
[**^\[2\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F22027859046_1) Brownmark correctly notes
that courts should usually refrain from granting [Rule 12(b)(6)]()
motions on affirmative defenses. [*United States v. Lewis,* 411 F.3d
838, 842 (7th Cir.2005)](). [Rule 12(b)(6)]() tests whether the
complaint states a claim for relief, and a plaintiff may state a claim
even though there is a defense to that claim. The mere presence of a
potential affirmative defense does not render the claim for relief
invalid. Further, these defenses typically turn on facts not before the
court at that stage in the proceedings. But when all relevant facts are
presented, the court may properly dismiss a case before
discovery---typically through a [Rule 12(c)]() Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings[]{#co_fnRef_B00012027859046_ID0EU3AG_1
.anchor}[^1^](#co_footnote_B00012027859046_1)---on the basis of an
affirmative defense. *See id.;* [*Brooks v. Ross,* 578 F.3d 574, 579
(7th Cir.2009)]() (approving of granting motions to dismiss based on the
statute of limitations when "the relevant dates \[that establish the
defense\] are set forth unambiguously in the complaint.").

 

[**^\[3\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F32027859046_1) Despite Brownmark\'s
assertions to the contrary, the only two pieces of evidence needed to
decide the question of fair use in this case are the original version of
WWITB and the episode at issue. Brownmark\'s copyright infringement
claim in its amended complaint was limited to the distribution of one
episode on television, *South Park\'s* website, iTunes and Amazon.com,
and DVD and Blu--Ray discs of "South Park Season 12 (Uncensored)."
Because the claim was limited to the production and distribution of a
single episode, the district court was correct to rely solely on the two
expressive works referenced in Brownmark\'s amended complaint and
attached to SPDS\'s motion, as well as the allegations in the complaint,
to decide on the fair use defense.

 

[**^\[4\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F42027859046_1)
[**^\[5\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F52027859046_1) SPDS relies on the
incorporation-by-reference doctrine to maintain that reliance on the
attached works does not violate [Rule 12(d)](), which requires that
[Rule 12(b)(6)]() or [12(c)]() motions containing materials outside of
the pleadings be converted into motions for summary judgment. It is well
settled that in deciding a [Rule 12(b)(6)]() motion, a court may
consider "documents attached to a motion to dismiss \... if they are
referred to in the plaintiff\'s complaint and are central to his claim."
[*Wright v. Assoc. Ins. Cos. Inc.,* 29 F.3d 1244, 1248 (7th
Cir.1994)](). In effect, the incorporation-by-reference doctrine
provides that if a plaintiff mentions a document in his complaint, the
defendant may then submit the document to the court without converting
defendant\'s 12(b)(6) motion to a motion for summary judgment. The
doctrine prevents a plaintiff from "evad\[ing\] dismissal under [Rule
12(b)(6)]() simply by failing to attach to his complaint a document that
prove\[s\] his claim has no merit." [*Tierney v. Vahle,* 304 F.3d 734,
738 (7th Cir.2002)]().

 

While the application of this doctrine to the present case would seem to
allow **\*691** SPDS\'s action, no court of appeals has ruled that the
content of television programs and similar works may be incorporated by
reference. Several district courts have concluded that the doctrine does
apply to such works. *See, e.g.,* [*Burnett v. Twentieth Century Fox,*
491 F.Supp.2d 962, 966 (C.D.Cal.2007)](); [*Zella v. E.W. Scripps Co.,*
529 F.Supp.2d 1124, 1131--32 (C.D.Cal.2007)](); [*Daly v. Viacom,* 238
F.Supp.2d 1118, 1121--22 (N.D.Cal.2002)](). And we think it makes
eminently good sense to extend the doctrine to cover such works,
especially in light of technological changes that have occasioned
widespread production of audio-visual works. The parties, however, did
not brief this issue, and so we reserve the resolution of the question
for a later date.

 

II\.

Following the recent trend of heightened pleading standards, as in
[*Ashcroft v. Iqbal,* 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868
(2009)]() and [*Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,* 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct.
1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)](), SPDS argues that we should encourage
courts to consider affirmative defenses on 12(b)(6) motions and thereby
reduce the threat of nuisance suits. We are sympathetic to the goal of
curtailing nuisance suits, but we feel that there is no need to enlarge
the role of 12(b)(6) motions, as there are already two other rules that
address the situation of dismissing baseless suits before discovery:
[Rule 12(c)]() Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and [Rule 56]()
Motion for Summary Judgment. Had SPDS\'s motion been captioned as a
motion for summary judgment, the district court would have employed
procedure essentially identical to procedure following a 12(b)(6)
motion.

 

It appears SPDS\'s reason for relying on the incorporation-by-reference
doctrine for its motion to dismiss, rather than simply captioning its
motion as a motion for summary judgment, was its concern that such a
maneuver would open the door to discovery. The expense of discovery,
which SPDS stressed at oral argument, looms over this suit. SPDS, and
amicus, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, remind this court that
infringement suits are often baseless shakedowns. Ruinous discovery
heightens the incentive to settle rather than defend these frivolous
suits. But discovery would only follow a [Rule 56]() motion if the
district court granted a request for discovery. District courts need
not, and indeed ought not, allow discovery when it is clear that the
case turns on facts already in evidence.

 

In this case, Brownmark did not request discovery. Brownmark claims that
it could not, as the matter before the court was a 12(b)(6) motion,
which does not allow for discovery requests. But this is hard to
believe. The caption on a motion does not have some independent
authority that litigants or courts must respect. Rather than relying on
the notion that consideration of a fair use defense in the context of a
12(b)(6) motion was premature, Brownmark could have provided a list of
possible evidence that would support its infringement claim and defeat
SPDS\'s fair use defense. Indeed, Brownmark provides such a list in its
briefs. Brownmark argues that it should be allowed to discover: the
intent of SPDS at the time the episode was created; all relevant video
images or clips, especially where such uses are divorced from the
Episode; and pre-airing licensing information related to the Episode. We
noted during oral argument that such a broad discovery request, surely
entailing expensive e-discovery of emails or other internal
communications, gives Brownmark the appearance of a "copyright troll."
We are confident that the **\*692** district court would have refused to
grant such expansive demands.

 

Therefore, rather than decide whether the videos may be
incorporated-by-reference in SPDS\'s motion to dismiss, we elect to
treat SPDS\'s motion as a motion for summary judgment. SPDS ought to
have captioned the motion as
such,[]{#co_fnRef_B00022027859046_ID0E5MBG_1
.anchor}[^2^](#co_footnote_B00022027859046_1) but the miscaptioning in
this case should not have caused confusion, as the procedures for both
motions are essentially the same. The only possible disadvantage to the
plaintiff was the lack of notice, *see* [*Edward Gray Corp. v. Nat\'l
Union Fire Ins. Co.,* 94 F.3d 363, 366 (7th Cir.1996)](), but this error
is harmless when the opponent opposing the motion could not have offered
any evidence in response. And as we noted above, the district court
required only the two videos to adjudicate this issue, especially in
light of Brownmark\'s failure to make any concrete contention that the
*South Park* episode reduced the financial returns from the original
WWITB video. The district court could properly consider an affirmative
defense in the context of a motion for summary judgment, which it did
here, regardless of the caption SPDS used.

 

III\.

[**^\[6\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F62027859046_1) Having confirmed that the
district court could properly dismiss the suit on the basis of an
affirmative defense at this early stage of the proceedings, all that
remains is to determine if the district court erred in its fair use
determination. This matter is simple because Brownmark, in response to
SPDS\'s motion, did not address fair use as applied to the WWITB videos,
and instead insisted that the court could not consider the matter at a
12(b)(6) stage. Since Brownmark never opposed SPDS\'s fair use argument
in the district court, we consider the argument waived.

 

[**^\[7\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F72027859046_1) However, even if Brownmark
were not barred from offering argument that SPDS did not engage in fair
use, we agree with the district court that this is an obvious case of
fair use. When a defendant raises a fair use defense claiming his or her
work is a parody, a court can often decide the merits of the claim
without discovery or a trial. When the two works in this case are viewed
side-by-side, the *South Park* episode is clearly a parody of the
original WWITB video, providing commentary on the ridiculousness of the
original video and the viral nature of certain YouTube videos.

 

The Copyright Act of 1976 sets forth four, non-exclusive factors that a
court must consider in determining whether a particular use of a
copyrighted work is a fair use: "(1) the purpose and character of the
use \...; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for
or value of the copyrighted work." [17 U.S.C. § 107 (2006)](). We
consider each **\*693** factor in turn, ultimately agreeing with the
district court\'s analysis and findings.

 

[**^\[8\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F82027859046_1) Central to determining the
purpose and character of a work is whether the new work merely
supersedes the original work, or instead adds something new with a
further purpose or of a different character. [*Campbell v. Acuff--Rose
Music, Inc.,* 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500
(1994)](). The underlying purpose and character SPDS\'s work was to
comment on and critique the social phenomenon that is the "viral video."
Brownmark\'s video exemplifies the "viral video." Through one of the
*South Park* characters---the innocent and naïve Butters---SPDS imitates
viral video creation while lampooning one particularly well-known
example of such a video. Moreover, the episode places Butters\' WWITB
video alongside other YouTube hits including, among others, the Numa
Numa Guy, the Sneezing Panda and the Afro Ninja. This kind of parodic
use has obvious transformative value, which under [§ 107]() is fair use.
*See* [§ 107]() (preamble); [*Campbell,* 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct.
1164]() ("\[P\]arody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair
use under [§ 107]().").

 

[**^\[9\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F92027859046_1) The creative and expressive
nature of the original WWITB places the work within the core of
copyright protection. But this factor only establishes that the original
elements of WWITB are protected to the outer bounds of copyright
protection, which is defined by fair use. In the case of parody, this
factor offers little help to Brownmark because "parodies almost
invariably copy publicly known, expressive works." [*Id.* at 586, 114
S.Ct. 1164.]()

 

[**^\[10\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F102027859046_1) Regarding the third
factor, SPDS\'s use of the original WWITB was not insubstantial.
Certainly, SPDS used the "heart" of the work; the work\'s overall design
and distinctive visual elements. [*Harper & Row, Publrs. v. Nation
Enters.,* 471 U.S. 539, 565, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985)]().
But in the context of parody, "\[c\]opying does not become excessive in
relation to parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the
original\'s heart." [*Campbell,* 510 U.S. at 588, 114 S.Ct. 1164.]()
Parody therefore "presents a difficult case." *Id.* Indeed, it may even
seem as an anomaly under fair use that parody, a favored use, must use a
substantial amount of qualitative and quantitative elements to create
the intended allusion; there are few alternatives. But when parody
achieves its intended aim, the amount taken becomes reasonable when the
parody does not serve as a market substitute for the work. *See*
[*id.*]() ("\[H\]ow much more is reasonable will depend \... on the
extent to which the \[work\'s\] overriding purpose and character is to
parody the original or, in contrast, the likelihood that the parody may
serve as a market substitute for the original."). The *South Park* WWITB
is clearly a parody and has not supplanted the original WWITB.

 

[**^\[11\]^**](#co_hn_anchor_F112027859046_1) It follows from the third
factor that SPDS\'s parody cannot have an actionable effect on the
potential market for or value of the original WWITB video under the
fourth factor. As the *South Park* episode aptly points out, there is no
"Internet money" for the video itself on YouTube, only advertising
dollars that correlate with the number of views the video has had. It
seems to this court that SPDS\'s likely effect, ironically, would only
increase ad revenue. Any effect on the derivative market for criticism
is not protectable. [*Id.* at 592, 114 S.Ct. 1164.]() And the plaintiff
has failed to give the district court or this court any concrete
suggestion about potential evidence indicating that the *South Park*
parody has cut into any real market **\*694** (with real, non-Internet
dollars) for derivative uses of the original WWITB video.

 

We agree with the district court\'s well-reasoned and delightful
opinion. For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is
Affirmed.

                                                        have introduced previous *South Park* episodes to show that

                                                        sex. *See, e.g., Butters\' Very Own Episode* (Comedy Central
