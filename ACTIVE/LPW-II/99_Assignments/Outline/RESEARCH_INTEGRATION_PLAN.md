# Research Integration Plan for EchoCraft Fair Use Brief

## Date: February 3, 2026

## Overview

This document synthesizes research findings from 9 core questions and provides specific guidance for integrating them into the brief outline. The research addresses most major areas but reveals some challenges, particularly around Factor 1 transformativeness post-*Warhol*.

---

## KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

### CRITICAL CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED:

#### 1. **Factor 1: Transformativeness - MAJOR CONCERN**

**PROBLEM:** Research shows that *Warhol* significantly restricts transformativeness claims when works serve "substantially the same purpose." This is problematic for us.

**From Research:**
- *Warhol* held that "correcting factual inaccuracies in an educational work likely does NOT constitute transformative use when both original and corrected works serve the same educational market"
- Mere factual accuracy enhancement does NOT count as "new meaning, message, or expression" sufficient for transformation
- Pedagogical transformation (memorization → critical thinking) "would likely be insufficient under Warhol's framework"
- **Key Quote:** "Since both works would typically be used in similar educational contexts to teach similar concepts, the degree of transformation would likely be insufficient"

**STRATEGIC RESPONSE:**
- Must emphasize **critical inquiry** vs. celebration (change in PURPOSE not just content)
- Focus on "critical bearing" requirement - we're criticizing the WORK itself, not just teaching better history
- Leverage *Campbell*'s "conjure up" standard extended to criticism beyond parody
- Strong emphasis on the **interrogative nature** (question mark in title signals fundamental shift)
- Frame as **criticism of Riven's factual claims**, not just improvement

**Specific Cases to Cite:**
- *Keeling v. Hars*, 809 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2015): Works can be BOTH derivative AND critical/educational
- *In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube*, 581 F.Supp.3d 509 (2022): "Strong presumption that factor one favors defendant if allegedly infringing work fits description of uses described in section 107"

---

#### 2. **Factor 3: 87.5% Copying - MODERATE CONCERN**

**From Research:**
- Highest percentage explicitly approved in 2d Circuit for criticism: Only **4.3%** in *Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, 803 F.2d 1253 (1986)
- No absolute percentage rules, but 87.5% is extraordinarily high
- Critical requirement: Copying must have "critical bearing" on the original work itself

**STRATEGIC RESPONSE:**
- Emphasize **necessity**: Cannot correct these specific factual errors without reproducing them
- Leverage NEW CONTENT: 59 words added (50.9% of final work); 116 total words vs. 66 original (75.8% increase)
- Qualitative analysis: Much of copied material = unprotectable historical facts
- *Campbell* "conjure up" standard applies to criticism, not just parody (*Warhol* confirmed this)

**Specific Cases to Cite:**
- *Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, 803 F.2d 1253 (1986): "No absolute rules as to how much of copyrighted work may be copied"
- *Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith*, 598 U.S. 508 (2023): "Other commentary or criticism that targets an original work may have compelling reason to 'conjure up' the original"

---

#### 3. **Factor 4: Market Harm - STRONG POSITION**

**From Research (EXCELLENT NEWS):**
- Preliminary negotiations without signed contracts, agreed prices, or finalized budgets do **NOT** establish cognizable market harm
- *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168 (2016): Requires "regular" requests that are "frequently" granted
- Single preliminary negotiation = insufficient
- Market superiority vs. substitution distinction recognized by courts

**STRATEGIC RESPONSE:**
- Hammer on preliminary nature: "We'll talk more soon" = ongoing discussion, not agreement
- No established licensing market existed
- Toobin chose EchoCraft for educational superiority (critical thinking), not mere substitution
- Fair use permits better works to compete

**Specific Cases to Cite:**
- *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168 (2016): "Regular" and "frequently" granted requests required
- *Castle Rock Entertainment v. Carol Pub. Group*, 150 F.3d 132 (1998): Market must be "traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed"
- *U.S. v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers*, 599 F.Supp.2d 415 (2009): Distinguishes harm from criticism (permissible) vs. substitution (impermissible)

---

#### 4. **Nonprofit/Educational Purpose - GOOD NEWS WITH CAVEATS**

**From Research:**
- Nonprofit subsidiary with incidental parent benefits does NOT automatically defeat educational characterization
- *Hachette Book Group v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163 (2024): "Characterizing these general benefits as commercial profits would render commercial the activities of virtually any nonprofit organization"
- Key: "Crux of profit/nonprofit distinction is whether user stands to profit from exploitation without paying customary price"
- Licensing at/below cost supports educational characterization

**STRATEGIC RESPONSE:**
- Emphasize actual nonprofit structure and below-cost pricing ($200 to schools)
- Revenue improvement (-5% to +2%) is correlation, not causation
- General reputational benefits ≠ commercial use
- Compare to university presses that enhance institutional reputation

**Specific Cases to Cite:**
- *Hachette Book Group v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163 (2024): General reputational benefits don't constitute commercial use
- *Mayo Clinic v. United States*, 145 F.4th 877 (2025): "Primary purpose" means "substantial" not "principal or most important"

---

#### 5. **Factual Content vs. Creative Expression - HELPFUL**

**From Research:**
- Historical facts, dates, names, events = NO copyright protection
- "One if by land, two if by sea" = unprotectable as historical phrase or public domain content
- *Feist* doctrine: Only creative expression protectable, not facts
- Educational context affects fair use analysis but doesn't alter copyrightability

**STRATEGIC RESPONSE:**
- Break down copied lines to show factual vs. creative content
- Much of what we copied = unprotectable historical facts
- Historical phrases existed before Riven's song
- "Heart" analysis: Did we take creative heart or factual core?

**Specific Cases to Cite:**
- *Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340 (1991): Fundamental fact-expression dichotomy
- *Estate of Smith v. Cash Money Records*, 253 F.Supp.3d 737 (2017): "Ordinary historical facts and events are not protectable"
- *Leary v. Manstan*, 118 F.Supp.3d 460 (2015): Historical phrases unprotectable

---

## INTEGRATION PRIORITIES (In Order)

### 1. **FACTOR 4 - ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY (Strongest Argument)**
   - Insert *TCA Television Corp.* holding on preliminary negotiations
   - Add *Castle Rock* framework for "potential market" definition
   - Integrate *ASCAP* distinction between criticism harm vs. substitution harm
   - Add causation analysis from *Hachette* (logical inference permitted, no complex econometrics required)

### 2. **FACTOR 1 - CRITICAL REVISIONS NEEDED (Most Vulnerable)**
   - Must reframe around **critical bearing on the work itself**
   - Integrate *Keeling v. Hars* on derivative + critical compatibility
   - Add statutory categories analysis: *Campbell*, *Rubin v. Brooks/Cole* strong presumption
   - Distinguish *Warhol*: We target RIVEN'S CLAIMS, not just teaching better history
   - Emphasize **interrogative purpose** - questioning the work's reliability

### 3. **FACTOR 3 - STRENGTHEN NECESSITY ARGUMENT**
   - Add *Maxtone-Graham* "no absolute rules" language
   - Integrate *Warhol*'s extension of "conjure up" beyond parody
   - Emphasize "critical bearing" requirement and factual content analysis
   - Break down qualitative vs. quantitative analysis more thoroughly

### 4. **NONPROFIT/COMMERCIAL ANALYSIS**
   - Add *Hachette* reputational benefits framework
   - Integrate *Mayo Clinic* "substantial purpose" test
   - Distinguish *Lish v. Harper's* (commercial objective to sell magazines)

## SPECIFIC BRIEF SECTIONS TO REVISE

### A. Factor 1 - Section B.1.a (Opening Thesis)
**Current:** Focuses primarily on transformation through correction
**Needs:** Reframe as **criticism with critical bearing on Riven's work itself**

**Add:**
```
The use has "critical bearing on the substance" of the original work (Warhol, 598 U.S. at [cite]), 
directly targeting Riven's specific factual claims rather than using the work merely to comment on 
broader historical topics. When "commentary or criticism targets an original work," it "may have 
compelling reason to 'conjure up' the original by borrowing from it." Id.
```

### B. Factor 1 - Section B.2 (Educational Correction)
**Current:** Substantive correction as criticism
**Needs:** Statutory category analysis with presumption language

**Add:**
```
Federal courts recognize a "strong presumption that factor one favors the defendant if the allegedly 
infringing work fits the description of uses described in section 107," including criticism and 
comment. In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube, 581 F.Supp.3d 509, [page] (S.D.N.Y. 2022). 
Works that "fit comfortably within several of the statutory categories" and "further the goals of 
copyright laws by adding value to prior intellectual labor" satisfy this standard. Rubin v. 
Brooks/Cole Pub. Co., 836 F.Supp. 909, [page] (D. Mass. 1993).
```

### C. Factor 3 - Section D.2.a (Campbell Standard)
**Current:** Generic "conjure up" reference
**Needs:** Specific extension to criticism beyond parody

**Add:**
```
While Campbell involved parody, the Supreme Court in Warhol confirmed that "other commentary or 
criticism that targets an original work may have compelling reason to 'conjure up' the original by 
borrowing from it." Andy Warhol Foundation, 598 U.S. at [cite]. However, this protection requires 
that the "commentary has [] critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition." 
Id. Here, EchoCraft's additions directly critique Riven's factual claims about Revere acting alone 
and revealing no secrets.
```

### D. Factor 4 - Section E.2 (No Established Market)
**Current:** Basic assertion of preliminary negotiations
**Needs:** Legal framework from TCA/Castle Rock

**Add:**
```
The Second Circuit requires evidence of "traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets" 
rather than speculative opportunities. Castle Rock Entertainment v. Carol Pub. Group, 150 F.3d 132, 
146 (2d Cir. 1998). Courts distinguish cognizable markets by requiring "regular" requests that are 
"frequently" granted. TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168, 181 (2d Cir. 2016). A single 
preliminary negotiation is insufficient; courts must assess "impact on potential licensing revenues 
for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets" rather than focusing on "possible 
lost licensing fees from defendants' challenged use," which "would always favor copyright owner." Id.
```

### E. Factor 4 - Section E.3 (Market Superiority vs. Substitution)
**Current:** Basic distinction mentioned
**Needs:** ASCAP framework for source-of-harm analysis

**Add:**
```
The Second Circuit distinguishes between permissible and impermissible market harm based on SOURCE. 
When harm results "from a transformative secondary use that lowered the public's estimation of the 
original (such as a devastating review)," it constitutes fair use "notwithstanding the harm." U.S. v. 
American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers, 599 F.Supp.2d 415, 426 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). By 
contrast, harm where "the secondary use, by copying the first, offers itself as a market substitute" 
argues against fair use. Id. Toobin chose EchoCraft's version because it "solicits critical 
discussion" (Record p.__), demonstrating preference for critical pedagogy rather than mere 
substitution.
```

## NEW COUNTER-ARGUMENTS TO ADD

### Counter-Argument 6: "Same Educational Market = Same Purpose Under Warhol"

**Appellant's Likely Claim:**
- *Warhol* establishes that works serving "substantially the same purpose" weigh against fair use
- Both songs teach AP History students about Paul Revere's ride
- Market overlap = purpose overlap under *Warhol*
- Educational superiority doesn't create different purpose

**Our Response:**
- *Warhol* distinguished: Magazine licensing served same commercial function as original photograph
- Here: Purpose fundamentally differs (celebration → critical inquiry)
- Market CATEGORY (education) ≠ market PURPOSE (memorization vs. critical thinking)
- *Keeling v. Hars*: Works can be both derivative and transformative when transforming "purpose and character" not just form
- Educational FUNCTION differs: Riven = passive memorization; EchoCraft = analytical engagement
- [CASE NEEDED: Post-Warhol case distinguishing market overlap from purpose overlap]

---

## RESEARCH GAPS & ADDITIONAL NEEDS

### Critical Gaps:
1. **Post-Warhol 2d Circuit educational use cases** - Research found NO post-Warhol educational fair use cases in 2d Circuit where use succeeded despite same market
2. **High-percentage copying for criticism** - Only 4.3% approved; need cases at higher percentages or stronger necessity arguments
3. **Standard of review for summary judgment on fair use** - Research mentions but doesn't provide specific 2d Cir. cases

### Additional Cases to Find:
1. **Factor 1:** Cases where criticism of factual accuracy constitutes transformation (not just entertainment criticism)
2. **Factor 3:** Cases approving >50% copying for critical/educational purposes
3. **Factor 4:** Cases explicitly rejecting preliminary negotiations as establishing market
4. **Summary Judgment:** 2d Cir. cases granting summary judgment on fair use despite competing evidence

---

## FACTUAL RECORD CITATIONS NEEDED

### From Research, These Facts Are Critical:
1. **Question mark in title** - "Revere Paul Revere?" vs. "Revere Paul Revere" (Record p.__)
2. **"Solicits critical discussion"** - Toobin testimony (Record p.__)
3. **"Deep rumination on problematic character"** - Raine testimony (Record p. 76-77)
4. **Purpose to correct inaccuracies** - Raine testimony (Record p. 86-87)
5. **Below-cost licensing** - $200 to schools (Record p. 74-75)
6. **Revenue data** - -5% to +2% improvement (Record p. 72-73)
7. **Preliminary negotiations** - "We'll talk more soon" (Exhibit I)
8. **No signed contract, no agreed price, no finalized budget** - (Record p.__ - FIND THIS)

**ACTION:** Review Record to verify all page citations and add missing citations.

---

## NEXT STEPS - PRIORITY ORDER

### Week 1: Factor 4 & Record Citations (Strongest Arguments)

## KEY STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Lead with Strength = Factor 4**
   - This is our clearest win
   - Preliminary negotiations doctrine is favorable
   - Market superiority vs. substitution is powerful

### 2. **Fortify Factor 1**
   - Most vulnerable post-*Warhol*
   - Must distinguish same-market from same-purpose
   - Emphasize critical targeting of Riven's work itself
   - Cannot just be "better history teaching" - must be CRITICISM of Riven's claims

### 3. **Factor 3 Necessity Argument**
   - 87.5% is very high but defensible if NECESSARY for critical purpose
   - Break down factual vs. creative content in each line
   - Show how NEW content transforms (50.9% of final work is original)

### 4. **Nonprofit Structure Matters**
   - Actual legal entity, actual below-cost pricing
   - Incidental benefits recognized by *Hachette* as legitimate
   - Compare to university presses (good analogy)

### 5. **Theme Throughout: Public Interest**
   - Historically accurate education benefits students
   - Copyright doesn't protect false factual claims
   - Fair use enables correction of inaccuracies in widely-used materials

---

## CONCLUSION

The research is comprehensive and addresses most critical issues. The main challenges are:

1. **Post-Warhol transformation standard** - This is our biggest hurdle; must emphasize critical bearing on original work
2. **High percentage copying** - Must show necessity and leverage factual content analysis
3. **Market harm from single negotiation** - Research strongly favors us here

Overall assessment: **Fair use claim is viable but requires careful framing**, especially distinguishing our facts from *Warhol*'s same-purpose analysis. The nonprofit structure, preliminary-only negotiations, and critical purpose give us strong arguments across all factors.

**Strategic Priority:** Reframe Factor 1 as CRITICISM OF RIVEN'S WORK, not merely improved history teaching. This is the key to surviving *Warhol*.
