# REMAINING SECTIONS: FACTOR 2, HOLISTIC ANALYSIS, SUMMARY JUDGMENT

**Draft #1 - EchoCraft (Appellee)**

---

## E. Factor 2: Nature of the Copyrighted Work

Factor 2 considers "the nature of the copyrighted work," recognizing that creative works receive greater protection than factual works. 17 U.S.C. § 107(2). Riven's song is a creative work, and this factor weighs slightly against EchoCraft. But its weight is limited.

**Riven's song contains both creative expression and historical facts.** The creative elements—word choice, rhyme scheme, narrative perspective—are protectable. But much of the content consists of historical facts: the date of Revere's ride, the "one if by land" signal, the towns on his route. Facts are not copyrightable. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 347-48 (1991).

**Moreover, Factor 2 "has rarely been determinative" in the fair use analysis.** *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 586 (1994). The Supreme Court cautioned that "all works are entitled to protection," and that Factor 2 "is not likely to help much" in distinguishing fair use from infringement. *Id.* Factor 2 therefore weighs slightly against EchoCraft, but this slight weight is overwhelmed by the strong transformativeness of Factor 1 and the lack of market harm in Factor 4.

## F. Holistic Analysis

The four factors "do not exist in vacuo." *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 36 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 178 (2d Cir. 2024)). They must be considered together, with proper weight given to each based on the circumstances.

**Factor 1 dominates this analysis.** EchoCraft's song is highly transformative—it critiques Riven's own song, not history itself. It serves a different educational function (critical discussion vs. rote memorization). It was distributed through a nonprofit educational division at below-cost pricing. Under *Santos*, "[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors, including commercialism." 154 F.4th at 39 (quoting *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579).

**Factor 3 poses no barrier.** EchoCraft copied extensively, but the copying was necessary to "conjure up" Riven's song for critique. Much of what was copied consists of unprotectable historical facts. EchoCraft then "departed markedly" by adding seven new lines that transform the work. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580-81.

**Factor 4 favors fair use.** Riven had no established licensing market—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never produced a contract. *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016). No derivative market exists for criticism of one's own work, because creators do not typically license such uses. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592; *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 40.

**Factor 2 weighs slightly against EchoCraft, but its weight is limited.** *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586. The creative nature of Riven's song does not overcome the strong transformativeness of EchoCraft's critical purpose.

**Taken together, these factors compel a finding of fair use.** Copyright law aims to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8. That progress depends on the ability to critique existing works, to question established narratives, to engage in critical discourse. EchoCraft's song advances this constitutional purpose. The district court correctly found fair use as a matter of law.

## G. Summary Judgment Proper

Summary judgment is appropriate when "no genuine dispute as to any material fact" exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). This Court reviews de novo. *Jacobsen v. Occupational Health & Rehab. Ctr.*, 229 F.3d 210, 213 (2d Cir. 2000).

**Fair use is a question of law on undisputed facts.** *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 32; *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 587 n.15. The parties have stipulated that Riven's copyright is valid. Stip. ¶ 9. The material facts are undisputed:
- EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven's song
- EchoCraft added seven new lines that transform the work
- EchoCraft released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary at below-cost pricing
- Riven had no signed licensing agreements, only preliminary negotiations

**The only question is whether these undisputed facts constitute fair use—a legal question for the court.** No genuine factual dispute precludes summary judgment. The district court correctly analyzed the four factors and concluded that EchoCraft's use was fair as a matter of law. That decision was correct.

**Accordingly, the district court's grant of summary judgment should be affirmed.**

### Outline Notes:

**Factor 2 (Nature):**
- Acknowledge creative work + factual content
- Campbell: Factor 2 "not likely to help much"
- Concede quickly, move on

**Holistic Analysis:**
- Santos: factors don't exist in vacuo
- Factor 1 dominance ("less significant other factors")
- Factor 3: conjure up, facts, marked departure
- Factor 4: no established market, no criticism market
- Factor 2: limited weight
- Constitutional purpose: promote progress through criticism

**Summary Judgment:**
- De novo standard (Jacobsen)
- Fair use as legal question (Santos, Campbell)
- Undisputed facts listed
- No genuine disputes preclude SJ
- Conclusion: affirm
