# DRAFT #1 ERROR CHECK REPORT

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** Fixes Applied + Comprehensive Review

## FIXES APPLIED ✅

### 1. Fixed: "More Accurate" Language (Remaster Trap)

**Location:** Factor 1, Section 1 (line 19)

**Before:**
> EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" and made the song **"more accurate"** to point out that the original story is "incomplete."

**After:**
> EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" to point out that the original story is "incomplete."

**Reason:** Removed dangerous "more accurate" language that triggers the remaster trap. Now focuses on "incomplete" framing which critiques Riven's narrative choices rather than claiming EchoCraft's version is "better."

---

### 2. Added: Statutory Presumption Argument

**Location:** Factor 1, New Section 2

**Added Content:**
> **Federal courts recognize a "strong presumption that factor one favors the defendant if the allegedly infringing work fits the description of uses described in section 107," including criticism and comment.** *In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube*, 581 F.Supp.3d 509, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). Works that "fit comfortably within several of the statutory categories" and "further the goals of copyright laws by adding value to prior intellectual labor" satisfy this standard. *Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co.*, 836 F.Supp. 909, 917 (D. Mass. 1993). EchoCraft's song fits squarely within the statutory categories of criticism, comment, and teaching.

**Reason:** Strengthens Factor 1 by establishing a presumption of fair use for works within statutory categories (criticism, comment, teaching).

---

### 3. Added: Maxtone-Graham Argument (Factor 3)

**Location:** Factor 3, Section 1

**Added Content:**
> **There are "no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered fair use."** *Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, 803 F.2d 1253, 1263 (2d Cir. 1986). The quantity must be reasonable in relation to the purpose. Because the purpose here is direct criticism of Riven's specific factual claims, reproducing those claims was necessary.

**Reason:** Adds 2d Circuit authority directly addressing percentage of copying. Strengthens response to high copying percentage argument.

---

### 4. Updated: Section Numbering

**Location:** Factor 1

**Changes:**
- Old Section 2 → Section 3 (Reasonable Observer Test)
- Old Section 3 → Section 4 (Different Educational Function)
- Old Section 4 → Section 5 (Nonprofit Educational Distribution)
- Old Section 5 → Section 6 (Factor 1 Weighs Decisively)
