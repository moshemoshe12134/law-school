# QUESTIONS PRESENTED

**Draft #1 - EchoCraft (Appellee)**

---

## II. Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment for EchoCraft and determining that EchoCraft's use of portions of Riven's song "Revere Paul Revere" constituted fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 where EchoCraft:

1. **Transformed Riven's celebratory original into critical inquiry** by adding a question mark to the title and changing key lyrics to question Riven's unnuanced portrayal of Paul Revere;
2. **Copied seven lines verbatim to establish the narrative before questioning it** under the "conjure up" doctrine recognized for parody and criticism;
3. **Released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary at below-cost pricing** for $200 per school; and
4. **Riven had no established licensing market**—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never resulted in a signed contract.

### Notes for Revision:

**Structure:** Four-part format following Moot Court Handbook guidance. Each clause highlights a distinct factual advantage.

**Strategic Choices:**
- Factor 1 first: Emphasizes transformative purpose (our strongest argument)
- Factor 3 second: Acknowledges copying but frames as necessary for criticism
- Factor 4 third: Highlights lack of established market (battleground issue)
- Nonprofit pricing: Addresses commercial nature concern upfront

**Bluebook Citations:**
- 17 U.S.C. § 107 (2012) - statutory reference

**Facts Used:**
- Question mark in title (Exhibit H)
- 7 of 8 lines copied (Riven testimony, p. 35)
- EchoCraft Ed not-for-profit, $200 below-cost pricing (Raine testimony, p. 74)
- No signed contract, only preliminary negotiations (Toobin deposition, p. 84)
