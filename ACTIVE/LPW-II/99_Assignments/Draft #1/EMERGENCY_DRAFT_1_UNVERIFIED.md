# IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS

# FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 25-1234

PHILIP RIVEN,

Plaintiff-Appellant,

v.

ECHOCRAFT PRODUCTIONS,

Defendant-Appellee.

On Appeal from the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York

**BRIEF FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLEE ECHOCRAFT PRODUCTIONS**

---

## QUESTION PRESENTED

Whether the district court properly granted summary judgment holding that EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" constitutes fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 where EchoCraft:

1. **Added a question mark to the title and changed key lyrics** to question Riven's portrayal of Paul Revere;
2. **Copied seven lines verbatim to establish the narrative before questioning it** under the "conjure up" doctrine recognized for parody and criticism;
3. **Released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary at below-cost pricing** for $200 per school; and
4. **Riven had no established licensing market**—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never resulted in a signed contract.

---

## STATEMENT OF THE CASE

### A. Factual Background

This appeal arises from two claims brought by plaintiff-appellant Philip Riven (“Riven”), a citizen and domiciliary of New York, against his former employer, EchoCraft Productions (“EchoCraft”), a New York City–based record company with offices across the country. R. 5. First, Riven alleges that EchoCraft terminated his employment in retaliation for an internal investigation he conducted regarding bonus disparities between departments, in violation of Title VII. *Id.* Second, Riven alleges that EchoCraft infringed his copyright in the educational song “Revere Paul Revere” by releasing a derivative work, “Revere Paul Revere?,” through EchoCraft’s nonprofit educational subsidiary. *Id.*

**Riven’s Employment History and Role at EchoCraft**
Riven was hired by EchoCraft on September 4, 2018, as a member of the company’s country songwriting team. R. 7. In or around early 2020, EchoCraft promoted Riven to manager of the country songwriting department. R. 6. As a department manager, Riven was responsible for overseeing song production and ensuring that his team met quarterly songwriting quotas established by the company. *Id.* For several years following his promotion, Riven received positive performance evaluations. Daphne Sniff, the head of the songwriting division at EchoCraft, rated Riven favorably in both 2021 and 2022. R. 14. In Riven’s 2022 performance review, Sniff noted that although Riven demonstrated promise and had “a bright future if he keeps it up,” he sometimes spent work hours on personal projects. R. 90.

**Riven’s Bonus Inquiry**
On December 21, 2022, EchoCraft held a company holiday party. R. 20. During the event, Riven spoke with Jackie Moses, a colleague who managed a different department within EchoCraft. *Id.* Moses told Riven that employees in her department, who were predominantly women, received lower bonuses than employees in Riven’s department, which was predominantly male. R. 21. On January 10, 2023, Riven raised the issue of bonus discrepancies with Sniff. *Id.* Sniff stated that she did not believe EchoCraft’s bonus system was discriminatory but told Riven that he could “poke around” if he wished. R. 23. Sniff did not direct Riven to conduct a formal investigation, nor did she instruct him to involve Human Resources or any compliance personnel. *Id.*

Between January and May 2023, Riven independently interviewed approximately eighty-one EchoCraft employees across roughly twelve departments regarding their salaries, performance reviews, and bonuses. R. 24. Riven did not file a complaint with Human Resources, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any governmental agency during this period. R. 108. In August 2023, Riven sent Sniff an email summarizing his findings. R. 93. In that email, Riven acknowledged that EchoCraft’s policies and benefits “really help our employees manage their work and feel valued by the company.” *Id.* Sniff responded that she took the concerns seriously but asked whether the project was “the best use of [Riven’s] time right now.” *Id.*

**Riven’s Performance Decline and Disciplinary History**
During the first half of 2023, Riven’s department failed to meet EchoCraft’s songwriting quotas for six consecutive months. R. 7. On July 5, 2023, Sniff issued Riven a formal warning regarding his department’s continued underperformance. *Id.* The warning placed Riven on notice that failure to improve could result in further discipline, including termination. R. 90. In both the third and fourth quarters of 2023, the department produced fewer songs than it had in the first two quarters. R. 93. Riven did not dispute that his department failed to meet the required quotas during this period. R. 7. On December 21, 2023, EchoCraft terminated Riven’s employment, citing his failure to meet songwriting quotas as a contributing factor. *Id.*

**Comparison to Ms. Moses**
Riven alleges that his termination was retaliatory in part because Jackie Moses was not terminated despite her department also failing to meet quotas. R. 7. Moses had approximately eighteen more years of experience at EchoCraft than Riven. R. 49. Moses’s department improved its output in the second half of 2023, whereas Riven’s did not. *Id.* Moses did not receive a formal warning in July 2023. R. 7.

**Riven’s Song**
Riven wrote and copyrighted a song titled “Revere Paul Revere,” intended for educational use. R. 98. The song presents a narrative of Paul Revere’s ride on April 18, 1775, reciting the date, the “one if by land” signal, and the route through Somerville, Arlington, and Medford. *Id.* The song’s final line states that Revere “revealed no secrets” when captured. *Id.*

**EchoCraft’s Song**
EchoCraft, through its non-profit educational division, released a song titled “Revere Paul Revere?” R. 98–99. EchoCraft’s song copies seven of the eight lines from Riven’s song verbatim and adds six entirely new lines and one rewritten line, constituting 50% of the final work. *Id.* The added lines include: “though others helped raise that warning’s light,” “yet he was not the only rider on that road,” and “The tale often stops with him, though many stood ready. / So the ride we recall is brave, but incomplete.” *Id.* EchoCraft’s version also changed the line “He revealed no secrets, the man was not skittish” to “He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish.” *Id.*

Jordan Raine, EchoCraft’s lead songwriter, testified that the purpose of the song was “a deep rumination on the problematic character of one of our country’s most celebrated figures.” R. 70. Raine stated that Riven’s original was “all about celebrating Paul Revere, but that’s just totally wrongheaded,” R. 71, and that EchoCraft’s version was designed to point out that the original story is “incomplete.” R. 72.

**Nonprofit Educational Distribution**
EchoCraft released the song through its “non-profit educational division.” R. 72. The song was licensed to schools for $200. R. 75. Raine testified that the price was “at or below cost” and “below the cost to us to produce and distribute it, so we did not make a profit.” R. 77. Raine stated that the division’s goal was to generate “good will,” not revenue. R. 75.

**Riven’s Licensing Negotiations**
Riven engaged in preliminary negotiations with Elle Toobin, the principal of Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School. R. 7. Toobin paid Riven a $500 “preliminary negotiation fee” to discuss a potential package of songs. R. 100–101. On January 14, 2024, Toobin emailed Riven stating, “Sounds good! We’ll talk more soon.” R. 100. No contract was ever drafted or signed. R. 85.

On February 14, 2024, Toobin terminated negotiations with Riven, stating that the school had “decided to go in a different direction.” R. 100. Toobin stated that EchoCraft’s song would “solicit a critical discussion about Revere’s legacy” and noted the “educational benefits to asking questions.” R. 86–87.

Following the termination of those negotiations, Riven attempted to market his song to other schools, but “no school was receptive.” R. 31. Riven acknowledges that “commercial interest in Riven’s original composition has effectively vanished.” R. 8.

### B. Procedural History

Riven filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging copyright infringement and retaliation under Title VII. The parties stipulated that Riven’s copyright is valid and that the only issue for the court on that claim was fair use. R. 2. Following discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of EchoCraft on both claims. Riven now appeals.

## SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

EchoCraft’s song “Revere Paul Revere?” is a fair use of Riven’s copyrighted work. The district court correctly granted summary judgment because the undisputed facts establish fair use as a matter of law.

**Factor 1—purpose and character.** Under *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, a use is transformative when it “adds something new, with a further purpose or different character.” 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994). Unlike in *Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, where both works served the same purpose, 598 U.S. 508, 526 (2023), EchoCraft’s song uses Riven’s lyrics as a starting point for criticism of Riven’s narrative choices. A reasonable observer would recognize that EchoCraft’s song serves a different purpose from Riven’s. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 34 (2d Cir. 2025). EchoCraft released the song through its nonprofit educational division at below-cost pricing. R. 77. Factor 1 weighs in EchoCraft’s favor.

**Factor 3—amount and substantiality.** EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines verbatim but added new content constituting 50% of the final work. R. 98–99. Criticism requires recognition: “[p]arody must be able to ‘conjure up’ at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable.” *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580–81. Much of what was copied consists of unprotectable historical facts. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 344 (1991). Factor 3 weighs at most slightly against EchoCraft.

**Factor 4—market effect.** The question is whether the secondary use “usurps the market for the original by offering a competing substitute.” *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 181 (2d Cir. 2024)). Riven had no established licensing market—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never produced a contract. R. 85. “[T]he unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market.” *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592. Columbia Grammar’s principal chose EchoCraft’s song for “critical discussion about Revere’s legacy,” R. 86—a different educational function. Factor 4 weighs in favor of fair use.

**Factor 2—nature of the copyrighted work.** Riven’s song is a creative work containing substantial factual content about historical events. This factor weighs slightly against EchoCraft but carries limited weight. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586.

The four factors, considered together, favor fair use. This Court should affirm.

## ARGUMENT

### A. STANDARD OF REVIEW

This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 587 n.15 (1994); *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 213 (2d Cir. 2015). Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 587 n.15. When the material facts are undisputed, fair use may be resolved as a matter of law. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 32 (2d Cir. 2025). Here, the parties stipulated that Riven’s copyright is valid and that the only issue is fair use. R. 2. The underlying facts—what was copied, what was added, the pricing, and the state of Riven’s licensing efforts—are not in genuine dispute.

### B. FACTOR ONE: PURPOSE AND CHARACTER OF THE USE

Factor 1 asks “whether the new work merely ‘supersede[s] the objects’ of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character.” *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579. The more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors. *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 36.

#### 1. EchoCraft’s Song Targets Riven’s Song for Criticism

Riven’s song presents a narrative of Paul Revere’s ride. R. 98. EchoCraft’s song copies that narrative and then questions it. The title adds a question mark—“Revere Paul Revere?”—turning Riven’s command into a question. R. 98–99. Where Riven writes “The British are Coming, the great man bellowed,” EchoCraft responds: “a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed.” R. 99. Where Riven states Revere “revealed no secrets,” EchoCraft changes the line to “He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish.” *Id.* The song concludes: “The tale often stops with him, though many stood ready. / So the ride we recall is brave, but incomplete.” *Id.*

Jordan Raine, EchoCraft’s lead songwriter, testified that Riven’s original was “all about celebrating Paul Revere, but that’s just totally wrongheaded.” R. 71. The purpose was to show that the original story is “incomplete.” R. 72.

In *Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, the Supreme Court found no transformativeness because both works served the same purpose—an illustration for a magazine article about Prince. 598 U.S. 508, 526 (2023). Here, by contrast, EchoCraft’s song serves a different purpose from Riven’s: it uses Riven’s lyrics as a starting point for criticism of Riven’s narrative choices. A reasonable observer would recognize that purpose. *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 34.

#### 2. The Reasonable Observer Test

Transformativeness turns on what a reasonable observer would perceive, not on the author’s subjective intent. *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 34; *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 216. A reasonable observer comparing the two songs would see: identical opening lines establishing Riven’s narrative, followed immediately by new lines qualifying and questioning that narrative, and a concluding message about incomplete storytelling. This structure signals criticism. See *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580.

#### 3. Nonprofit Educational Distribution

Factor 1 also considers whether the use “is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). EchoCraft released the song through its non-profit educational division. R. 72. The song was licensed to schools for $200, which Raine testified was “below the cost to us to produce and distribute it.” R. 77. The division’s goal was to generate “good will,” not revenue. R. 75.

EchoCraft’s parent company is a for-profit record label, but incidental commercial benefit does not negate transformativeness. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579; *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 39 (finding fair use despite commercial context). Obtaining “nonmonetary benefits … including advancing its mission and bolstering its reputation” does not render a nonprofit use commercial. *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 182 (2d Cir. 2024).

Factor 1 weighs in EchoCraft’s favor.

### C. FACTOR THREE: AMOUNT AND SUBSTANTIALITY OF THE PORTION USED

Factor 3 examines “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven’s song. R. 98–99.

#### 1. The Conjure Up Doctrine

Criticism requires recognition. “[P]arody must be able to ‘conjure up’ at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable.” *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580–81. In *Campbell*, 2 Live Crew copied the bassline and opening verse of “Pretty Woman”—the most recognizable parts—and the Court held that “copy does not become excessive in relation to parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the original’s heart.” *Id.* at 586. EchoCraft could not critique Riven’s narrative without first establishing what that narrative says.

#### 2. Much of What Was Copied Consists of Unprotectable Facts

Facts are not copyrightable. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 344 (1991). Riven’s song contains substantial factual content: the date April 18, 1775; the “one if by land” signal; the towns of Somerville, Arlington, and Medford; and the phrase “The British are Coming.” These facts belong to history. *Feist*, 499 U.S. at 345.

#### 3. EchoCraft Added Substantial New Content

After copying Riven’s lines, EchoCraft added new content constituting 50% of the final song. R. 98–99. The additions include lines questioning Riven’s narrative, correcting historical omissions, and offering an alternative perspective. *Id.* When the secondary use serves a different purpose, Factor 3 “will rarely prove fatal.” *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (citing *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 223).

Factor 3 weighs at most slightly against EchoCraft.

### D. FACTOR FOUR: EFFECT OF THE USE UPON THE POTENTIAL MARKET

Factor 4 considers “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). The question is whether the secondary use “usurps the market for the original by offering a competing substitute.” *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (quoting *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 181).

#### 1. Riven Had No Established Licensing Market

Market effect analysis focuses on “traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets.” *Castle Rock Ent., Inc. v. Carol Publ’g Grp., Inc.*, 150 F.3d 132, 145 (2d Cir. 1998). Riven received a $500 “preliminary negotiation fee” from Columbia Grammar’s principal, but no contract was ever drafted or signed. R. 85. This single preliminary discussion does not establish a market. See *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016). After those negotiations ended, Riven attempted to market his song to other schools, but “no school was receptive.” R. 31.

#### 2. No Licensing Market Exists for Criticism of One’s Own Work

“[T]he unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market.” *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592. The Second Circuit confirmed that “creators do not typically license uses that are critical of or hostile to their own work,” and therefore “criticisms will rarely cause cognizable market harm.” *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 40.

#### 3. Columbia Grammar’s Choice Does Not Show Substitution

Principal Toobin chose EchoCraft’s song because it would “solicit a critical discussion about Revere’s legacy.” R. 86. Riven’s song aids memorization of historical facts. R. 98. Toobin’s stated reason reflects a preference for a different educational function, not a substitution of the same one. See *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 216.

Factor 4 weighs in favor of fair use.

### E. FACTOR TWO: NATURE OF THE COPYRIGHTED WORK

Factor 2 considers “the nature of the copyrighted work.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(2). Riven’s song contains both creative expression and historical facts. The creative elements are protectable, but the historical facts—dates, signals, towns—are not. *Feist*, 499 U.S. at 347–48. Factor 2 “has rarely been determinative” in fair use analysis. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586. This factor weighs slightly against EchoCraft.

### F. HOLISTIC ANALYSIS

The four factors, considered together, favor fair use. Factor 1 weighs in EchoCraft’s favor because the song serves a different purpose—criticism of Riven’s narrative choices. Factor 3 weighs at most slightly against EchoCraft because copying was necessary to identify the target of criticism. Factor 4 favors fair use because no licensing market exists for criticism and Riven had no established market for his song. Factor 2 weighs slightly against EchoCraft but carries limited weight. This Court should affirm.

---

## CONCLUSION

The district court correctly granted summary judgment for EchoCraft. EchoCraft’s song “Revere Paul Revere?” is a fair use of Riven’s copyrighted work. The four-factor analysis favors fair use: Factor 1 weighs in EchoCraft’s favor because the song serves a different purpose; Factor 3 poses no barrier because copying was necessary for criticism; Factor 4 favors fair use because no licensing market exists for criticism of one’s own work; and Factor 2 carries limited weight. On undisputed facts, fair use is a matter of law. This Court should affirm.

Respectfully submitted,
