# FACTOR 3: AMOUNT AND SUBSTANTIALITY

**Draft #1 - EchoCraft (Appellee)**

---

## C. Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

Factor 3 examines "the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole." 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven's song, plus 57 of 66 words. This extensive copying would normally weigh against fair use. But when copying is necessary for criticism, as here, Factor 3 poses no barrier to fair use.

### 1. EchoCraft Acknowledges—and Explains—Its Extensive Copying

**The quantity is undisputed.** Riven testified that "seven of the lines are identical." Riven Test. at 35. The record shows that EchoCraft copied 57 of 66 words from Riven's original—86.4% of the text. Master Fact Sheet at 6.

**But quantity alone is not disqualifying.** In *Santos*, the Second Circuit held that "the extent of a copying can be overshadowed by the highly transformative purpose of the secondary work." 154 F.4th at 38 (citing *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 223). Indeed, *Santos* affirmed fair use even though Kimmel copied 100% of the defendants' social media posts. *Id.* at 37. When the secondary use serves a different purpose, extensive copying may be justified.

**There are "no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered fair use."** *Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, 803 F.2d 1253, 1263 (2d Cir. 1986). The quantity must be reasonable in relation to the purpose. Because the purpose here is direct criticism of Riven's specific factual claims, reproducing those claims was necessary.

### 2. The "Conjure Up" Doctrine Justifies Copying the Heart of the Work

**Parody and criticism require recognition.** As the Supreme Court explained in *Campbell*, "parody must be able to 'conjure up' at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable." 510 U.S. at 580-81. This recognition requirement often justifies copying the "heart" of the original work.

**The Court specifically rejected a quantitative approach in *Campbell*.** 2 Live Crew copied the bassline and opening verse of "Pretty Woman"—the most recognizable parts. The Court held that "copy does not become excessive in relation to parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the original's heart." *Id.* at 586. What matters is whether the copying is justified by the parodic purpose.

**The same principle applies here.** EchoCraft could not critique Riven's song without first establishing what Riven's song says. The identical opening lines—"Revere Paul Revere / It was the night of April 18, 1775"—serve this recognition function. They conjure up Riven's narrative before questioning it. This is precisely what *Campbell* permits.

### 3. Much of What Was Copied Consists of Unprotectable Facts

**Historical facts are not copyrightable.** In *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, the Supreme Court held that "facts and data, as opposed to their original expression, are not copyrightable." 499 U.S. 340, 364 (1991).

**Riven's song contains substantial factual content:**
- "April 18, 1775" — historical date
- "One if by land Two if By Sea" — historical signal code
- "Somerville, Arlington, and Medford" — geographic route
- "The British are Coming" — historical phrase (though apocryphal)

**These facts belong to history, not Riven.** EchoCraft's use of these facts does not infringe Riven's copyright. *Feist*, 499 U.S. at 364-65. Factor 3 should be interpreted to exclude unprotectable factual content from the "substantiality" inquiry. See *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586 (acknowledging that factual works receive less protection).

### 4. EchoCraft "Depart[ed] Markedly" with New Content

**After copying Riven's lines, EchoCraft added seven new lines—50% of the final song.** Master Fact Sheet at 6. These new lines transform the work:
- "though others helped raise that warning's light" — corrects Riven's omission
- "yet he was not the only rider on that road" — adds missing context
- "a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed" — critiques Riven's phrase
- "So let's remember the others who also helped defeat" — proposes alternative

**The Supreme Court in *Campbell* emphasized that parody "must 'comment on' the original or criticize it."** 510 U.S. at 581 (quoting *Fisher v. Dees*, 794 F.2d 432, 437 (9th Cir. 1986)). EchoCraft's new lines provide this commentary. They do not merely remix Riven's content; they interrogate it.

**The structure matters.** EchoCraft establishes Riven's narrative, then immediately qualifies it ("though others helped"), then critiques it ("a line the storytellers favor"), then concludes with a call to remember others. This is not mere variation. It is critical engagement—precisely the kind of expressive work that fair use exists to enable.

### 5. Factor 3 Does Not Preclude Fair Use

**Taken together, these considerations show that Factor 3 poses no barrier to fair use.** EchoCraft copied extensively, but:
- The copying was necessary to "conjure up" Riven's song for critique (*Campbell*)
- Much of what was copied consists of unprotectable historical facts (*Feist*)
- EchoCraft "departed markedly" by adding seven new lines that transform the work (*Campbell*)

**When the secondary use serves a different purpose, Factor 3 "will rarely prove fatal."** *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (citing *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 223). Here, EchoCraft's critical purpose justifies the copying. Factor 3 therefore weighs at most slightly against EchoCraft—and this slight weight is overwhelmed by the strong transformativeness of Factor 1.

### Outline Notes:

**Structure:**
1. **Introduction** - Factor 3 standard; acknowledge extensive copying
2. **Percentage Not Dispositive** - Santos (100% OK), Maxtone-Graham (no absolute rules)
3. **Conjure Up Doctrine** - Campbell: copying heart justified for parody/recognition
4. **Factual Content** - Feist: historical facts not copyrightable; list unprotectable elements
5. **Marked Departure** - 7 new lines (50% of song); transformation through commentary
6. **Conclusion** - Factor 3 not fatal; different purpose justifies copying; outweighed by Factor 1

**Key Authority:**
- Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 580-81, 586 (1994) - conjure up doctrine, heart of work, marked departure
- Santos v. Kimmel, 154 F.4th 30, 37-38 (2d Cir. 2025) - 100% copying acceptable, overshadowed by transformative purpose
- Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 F.2d 1253, 1263 (2d Cir. 1986) - no absolute rules on quantity
- Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 364-65 (1991) - facts not copyrightable

**Record Facts:**
- 7 of 8 lines identical (Riven testimony, p. 35)
- 57 of 66 words copied (86.4%)
- 7 new lines added (50% of final song)
- Specific factual elements listed
- New lines quoted

**Strategic Points:**
- Acknowledge copying forthrightly (credibility)
- Pivot immediately to justification (conjuration, facts, departure)
- Santos: 100% copying OK when purpose differs
- Factor 3 "rarely fatal" with transformative purpose
