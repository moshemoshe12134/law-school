# IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS

# FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 25-1234

PHILIP RIVEN,

Plaintiff-Appellant,

v.

ECHOCRAFT PRODUCTIONS,

Defendant-Appellee.

On Appeal from the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York

**BRIEF FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLEE ECHOCRAFT PRODUCTIONS**

---

## QUESTION PRESENTED

Whether the district court properly granted summary judgment holding that EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" constitutes fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 where EchoCraft:

1. **Transformed Riven's celebratory original into critical inquiry** by adding a question mark to the title and changing key lyrics to question Riven's unnuanced portrayal of Paul Revere;
2. **Copied seven lines verbatim to establish the narrative before questioning it** under the "conjure up" doctrine recognized for parody and criticism;
3. **Released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary at below-cost pricing** for $200 per school; and
4. **Riven had no established licensing market**—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never resulted in a signed contract.

## STATEMENT OF THE CASE

### A. Factual Background

**Riven’s Song: A Celebratory Narrative**
Plaintiff-Appellant Philip Riven (“Riven”) wrote and copyrighted a song titled “Revere Paul Revere.” The song, intended for educational use, presents a straightforward, celebratory narrative of Paul Revere’s ride on April 18, 1775. (Record p. 98). Riven’s lyrics focus on rote memorization of historical facts, reciting the date, the “one if by land” signal, and the route through Somerville, Arlington, and Medford. The song concludes by portraying Revere as a solitary hero who “revealed no secrets” when captured. *Id.* at 98.

**EchoCraft’s Song: A Critical Inquiry**
Defendant-Appellee EchoCraft Productions (“EchoCraft”), through its non-profit educational division, released a song titled “Revere Paul Revere?” (Record pp. 98-99). The addition of the question mark in the title signals the song’s transformative purpose: to interrogate the specific, simplistic narrative constructed by Riven. EchoCraft’s song does not merely present a different history; it directly critiques Riven’s adulatory lyrics and his choice to omit crucial context.

EchoCraft’s song copies seven of the eight lines from Riven’s song verbatim to establish the traditional narrative. However, it immediately qualifies and critiques that narrative by adding new lyrical content—including six entirely new lines and one rewritten line—that constitutes 50% of the final work. For example, where Riven sings that Revere’s warning was the signal, EchoCraft adds, “though others helped raise that warning’s light.” *Id.* Where Riven asserts Revere “revealed no secrets,” EchoCraft corrects this to “He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish.” *Id.* The song concludes by explicitly criticizing the traditional focus on Revere: “The tale often stops with him, though many stood ready. / So the ride we recall is brave, but incomplete.” *Id.*

Jordan Raine, EchoCraft’s lead songwriter, testified that the purpose of the song was "a deep rumination on the problematic character of one of our country's most celebrated figures." (Record p. 70). Raine explained that Riven’s original was "all about celebrating Paul Revere, but that's just totally wrongheaded," (Record p. 71), and that EchoCraft’s version was designed to point out that the original story is "incomplete." (Record p. 72).

**Nonprofit Educational Distribution**
EchoCraft released the song through its "non-profit educational division." (Record p. 72). The song was licensed to schools for $200 (Record p. 75), a price Raine testified was "at or below cost" and "below the cost to us to produce and distribute it, so we did not make a profit." (Record p. 77). The division’s goal was to generate "good will," not revenue. (Record p. 75).

**Lack of Established Market for Riven’s Song**
Riven had no established licensing market for his song. He engaged in preliminary negotiations with Elle Toobin, the principal of Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School. (Record p. 7). Toobin paid Riven a $500 "preliminary negotiation fee" to discuss a potential package of songs. (Record pp. 100-101; Record p. 7). On January 14, 2024, Toobin emailed Riven saying, "Sounds good! We'll talk more soon" (Record p. 100), but no contract was ever drafted or signed (Record p. 85).

On February 14, 2024, Toobin terminated negotiations with Riven, stating that the school had "decided to go in a different direction." (Record p. 100). Toobin ultimately chose EchoCraft’s song because it would "solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy," noting the "educational benefits to asking questions" rather than merely memorizing facts. (Record pp. 86-87).

Following the termination, Riven attempted to market his song to other schools, but "no school was receptive." (Record p. 31). Riven admits that "commercial interest in Riven's original composition has effectively vanished." (Record p. 8).

### B. Procedural History

Riven filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging copyright infringement. The parties stipulated that Riven’s copyright is valid and that the only issue for the court was fair use. (Record p. 2). Following discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of EchoCraft, finding that its use of Riven’s song constituted fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107. Riven now appeals.

## SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" is a fair use of Riven's copyrighted work because it serves a fundamentally different purpose—critical inquiry about Riven's own song—rather than substituting for Riven's celebratory original in the educational market. The district court correctly granted summary judgment because fair use is a question of law on undisputed facts, and the four-factor test overwhelmingly favors EchoCraft.

**Factor 1—purpose and character—weighs decisively in EchoCraft's favor.** Under *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, a use is transformative when it "adds something new, with a further purpose or different character" rather than merely superseding the original. 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994). Unlike in *Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, where both works served identical commercial purposes, EchoCraft's song targets Riven's unnuanced, adulatory treatment of Paul Revere for criticism. The question mark in the title signals interrogation of Riven's narrative choices, not historical uncertainty. A reasonable observer would recognize that EchoCraft does something Riven would never do—criticize his own song's simplistic hero-worship. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 34 (2d Cir. 2025). This transformativeness "reduc[es] the significance" of any incidental commercialism. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

**Factor 3—amount and substantiality—does not defeat fair use because extensive copying was necessary to conjure up Riven's song for critique.** EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines verbatim, but then "depart[ed] markedly" by adding seven new lines that question Riven's narrative. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580. Parody must be able to "conjure up at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable." *Id.* at 580-81. Much of what was copied consists of unprotectable historical facts—the date of Revere's ride, the "one if by land" signal, the towns through which he rode. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 347-48 (1991) (facts not copyrightable). When the copied content is primarily factual, the quantity matters less. Moreover, *Santos* confirms that even 100% copying may be fair when "the secondary use serves a purpose distinct from the original." 154 F.4th at 38.

**Factor 4—market effect—does not show harmful substitution.** The relevant inquiry is "whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original by offering a competing substitute." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 181 (2d Cir. 2024)). EchoCraft's song does not substitute for Riven's; if anything, it is Riven's copyright claim that would suppress critical discussion of his own work. As *Campbell* recognized, "the unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market." 510 U.S. at 592. Riven had no established licensing market—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never produced a contract. *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016) (single discussion insufficient to establish market). When Columbia Grammar's principal chose EchoCraft's version, she sought "critical discussion about Revere's legacy"—a different educational function from Riven's rote-memorization approach. This pedagogical preference is not market substitution.

**Factor 2—nature of the copyrighted work—weighs slightly against EchoCraft but carries "limited weight" in the fair use analysis.** *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586. Riven's song is a creative work, but it contains substantial factual and informational content about historical events.

**Taken together, these factors compel affirmance.** The strong transformativeness of EchoCraft's critical purpose dominates the analysis. *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 36 ("[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors"). Summary judgment was proper because fair use is a legal question on undisputed facts, and no genuine dispute exists that would preclude fair use as a matter of law. This Court should affirm.

## ARGUMENT

### A. STANDARD OF REVIEW

This Court reviews a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. *Jacobsen v. Occupational Health & Rehab. Ctr.*, 229 F.3d 210, 213 (2d Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is appropriate when "no genuine dispute as to any material fact" exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

**Fair use is a question of law, not fact.** *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 32 (2d Cir. 2025); *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 587 n.15 (1994) ("fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, but one best resolved on a case-by-case basis in the context of a particular case"). The four-factor analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107(1)-(4) requires a court to make "normative judgments about the expressive purpose of a work." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 32. These judgments are legal conclusions subject to de novo review. *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 213 (2d Cir. 2015).

When material facts are undisputed, as here, the district court must determine fair use as a matter of law. The parties have stipulated that Riven's copyright is valid and that the only issue is fair use. (Record p. 4). The record shows that EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven's song, added substantial new content, released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary, and that Riven had no signed licensing agreements. These facts are not in genuine dispute. The only question is whether those undisputed facts constitute fair use—a legal question for the court.

### B. FACTOR ONE: PURPOSE AND CHARACTER OF THE USE

Factor 1 "is undoubtedly the single most important" factor in the fair use analysis. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 36 (2d Cir. 2025). This factor asks "whether the new work merely 'supersede[s] the objects' of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character." *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994). EchoCraft's song does something fundamentally different from Riven's—it critiques Riven's own song. This transformativeness, combined with educational distribution, makes Factor 1 weigh decisively in EchoCraft's favor.

#### 1. EchoCraft's Song Targets Riven's Song, Not History Itself

**The critical question is what EchoCraft's song targets for criticism.** EchoCraft does not use Riven's song to teach about Paul Revere. Both songs are about Paul Revere. Rather, EchoCraft uses Riven's song to critique Riven's *portrayal* of Paul Revere.

**The question mark in the title—"Revere Paul Revere?"—signals this shift.** Riven's title is a command: "Revere Paul Revere." EchoCraft adds a question mark, transforming command into interrogation. The question mark does not express doubt about historical facts. It expresses doubt about *Riven's narrative choices*.

**EchoCraft's changes target Riven's celebratory approach.** Where Riven sings "The British are Coming, the great man bellowed," EchoCraft responds: "The British are coming, the great man bellowed— / a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed." (Record p. 99). This critiques Riven's phrase, not Revere's actions. Where Riven claims "He revealed no secrets, the man was not skittish," EchoCraft corrects: "He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish." (Id.). This exposes Riven's historical inaccuracies—but the target remains Riven's song, not Revere himself.

**EchoCraft's lead songwriter explained this purpose.** Jordan Raine testified that Riven's original was "all about celebrating Paul Revere, but that's just totally wrongheaded." (Record p. 75). EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" and made the song "more accurate" to point out that the original story is "incomplete." (Id.). This is criticism of Riven's song, not teaching about history.

**This distinction matters.** In *Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, the Supreme Court found no transformativeness because both works served the same purpose: an illustration for a magazine article about Prince. 598 U.S. 508, 526 (2023). Warhol's image did not critique Goldsmith's photograph. It simply repurposed it for the same commercial use. Here, by contrast, EchoCraft does something Riven would never do—criticize his own song's simplistic hero-worship. That is transformative.

#### 2. Statutory Presumption of Fair Use

**Federal courts recognize a "strong presumption that factor one favors the defendant if the allegedly infringing work fits the description of uses described in section 107," including criticism and comment.** *In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube*, 581 F.Supp.3d 509, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). Works that "fit comfortably within several of the statutory categories" and "further the goals of copyright laws by adding value to prior intellectual labor" satisfy this standard. *Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co.*, 836 F.Supp. 909, 917 (D. Mass. 1993). EchoCraft’s song fits squarely within the statutory categories of criticism, comment, and teaching.

#### 3. The "Reasonable Observer" Test Confirms Transformativeness

**Transformativeness turns on what a reasonable observer thinks, not the author's subjective intent.** *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 34; *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 216 (2d Cir. 2015) (asking what a "reasonable person" would perceive).

**A reasonable observer comparing the two songs would recognize EchoCraft's critique.** The observer would see:

- Identical opening lines establishing the baseline narrative
- New lines immediately qualifying that narrative ("though others helped raise that warning's light")
- Direct commentary on Riven's choices ("a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed")
- A final message about incomplete storytelling ("the ride we recall is brave, but incomplete")

**This structure signals criticism, not substitution.** The observer would understand that EchoCraft quotes Riven to question Riven's approach—precisely the kind of critical engagement that fair use exists to protect. See *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580 (parody "must be able to 'conjure up' at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable").

#### 4. EchoCraft's Song Serves a Different Educational Function

**Riven's song teaches through rote memorization.** The lyrics present a straightforward narrative: dates, events, names, locations. (Record p. 98). This aids memorization, not critical thinking.

**EchoCraft's song teaches through critical discussion.** Columbia Grammar's principal testified that EchoCraft's song would "solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy" and that "there are educational benefits to asking questions about Paul Revere's legacy." (Record p. 86). This is a different pedagogical function.

**Toobin chose EchoCraft's version because it "solicits critical discussion" (Record p. 86), demonstrating preference for critical pedagogy rather than mere substitution.** These are not substitutes in the same market. They are different educational tools serving different purposes. Cf. *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 216 (finding transformative use where "Google's use of the copyrighted works serves a very different function" than the originals).

**Importantly, EchoCraft avoids the "remaster trap."** Courts have rejected fair use claims where the secondary work merely "remasters" the original—making it more accurate or better while serving the same purpose. See, e.g., *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 180 (2d Cir. 2024) (finding no fair use when defendant made books available for "lending" in the same manner as libraries); *Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of Am., Inc.*, 4 N.Y.3d 540, 563-64 (2005) (holding that "remastering" old recordings to improve sound quality did not create a new or independent work). EchoCraft does not claim to teach history "better." It claims to question Riven's narrative choices. That is different. The Second Circuit has held that works can be both derivative and transformative when they alter the "purpose and character" of the original, not just its form. *Keeling v. Hars*, 809 F.3d 43, 50 (2d Cir. 2015).

#### 5. Nonprofit Educational Distribution Favors Fair Use

Factor 1 considers whether a use "is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). EchoCraft's song was released through EchoCraft Ed, the company's "not-for-profit education division." (Record p. 83).

**EchoCraft charged schools $200 per license—below cost.** Raine testified that "the amount we charged was below the cost to us to produce and distribute it, so we did not make a profit." (Record pp. 83-84). The purpose was "generat[ing] significant good will," not revenue. (Record p. 83).

**True, EchoCraft's parent company is a for-profit record label,** **but incidental commercial benefit does not make a use non-transformative**. In *Santos*, the Second Circuit found fair use even though Kimmel's podcast was commercial and profitable. 154 F.4th at 39. Moreover, obtaining "nonmonetary benefits...including advancing its mission and bolstering its reputation" does not render a nonprofit use commercial. *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 182. A rule treating reputational benefits as commercial profits would "render commercial the activities of virtually any nonprofit organization." *Id.* Strong transformativeness, in any event, "may well excuse" any incidental commercialism. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

**Factor 1 Weighs Decisively for EchoCraft.** EchoCraft's use is highly transformative. Factor 1 therefore weighs decisively in favor of fair use and "reduces the significance" of the remaining factors. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

### C. FACTOR THREE: AMOUNT AND SUBSTANTIALITY OF THE PORTION USED

Factor 3 examines "the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole." 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven's song, plus 57 of 66 words. This extensive copying would normally weigh against fair use. But when copying is necessary for criticism, as here, Factor 3 poses no barrier to fair use.

#### 1. The "Conjure Up" Doctrine Justifies Copying the Heart of the Work

**Parody and criticism require recognition.** As the Supreme Court explained in *Campbell*, "parody must be able to 'conjure up' at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable." 510 U.S. at 580-81. This recognition requirement often justifies copying the "heart" of the original work.

**The Court specifically rejected a quantitative approach in *Campbell*.** 2 Live Crew copied the bassline and opening verse of "Pretty Woman"—the most recognizable parts. The Court held that "copy does not become excessive in relation to parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the original's heart." *Id.* at 586. What matters is whether the copying is justified by the parodic purpose.

**The same principle applies here.** EchoCraft could not critique Riven's song without first establishing what Riven's song says. The identical opening lines—"Revere Paul Revere / It was the night of April 18, 1775"—serve this recognition function. They conjure up Riven's narrative before questioning it. This is precisely what *Campbell* permits.

#### 2. Percentage of Copying is Not Dispositive

**While EchoCraft copied 87.5% of Riven's lines, there are "no absolute rules as to how much of copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered fair use."** *Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, 803 F.2d 1253, 1263 (2d Cir. 1986). The quantity must be reasonable in relation to the purpose. Because the purpose here is direct criticism of Riven's specific factual claims, reproducing those claims was necessary.

#### 3. Much of What Was Copied Consists of Unprotectable Facts

**Historical facts are not copyrightable.** In *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, the Supreme Court held that "[t]he first [well-established proposition] is that facts are not copyrightable." 499 U.S. 340, 344 (1991).

**Riven's song contains substantial factual content:**

- "April 18, 1775" — historical date
- "One if by land Two if By Sea" — historical signal code
- "Somerville, Arlington, and Medford" — geographic route
- "The British are Coming" — historical phrase (though apocryphal)

**These facts belong to history, not Riven.** EchoCraft's use of these facts does not infringe Riven's copyright. *Feist*, 499 U.S. at 345. Factor 3 should be interpreted to exclude unprotectable factual content from the "substantiality" inquiry. See *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586 (acknowledging that factual works receive less protection).

#### 3. EchoCraft "Depart[ed] Markedly" with New Content

**After copying Riven's lines, EchoCraft added substantial new content—50% of the final song.** (Record pp. 98-99). These additions transform the work:

- "though others helped raise that warning's light" — corrects Riven's omission
- "yet he was not the only rider on that road" — adds missing context
- "a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed" — critiques Riven's phrase
- "He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish" — rewrites Riven's line to correct history
- "So let's remember the others who also helped defeat" — proposes alternative

**The Supreme Court in *Campbell* emphasized that parody "must 'comment on' the original or criticize it."** 510 U.S. at 581 (quoting *Fisher v. Dees*, 794 F.2d 432, 437 (9th Cir. 1986)). EchoCraft's new lines provide this commentary. They do not merely remix Riven's content; they interrogate it. The structure matters: EchoCraft establishes Riven's narrative, then immediately qualifies it, then critiques it. This is critical engagement.

**When the secondary use serves a different purpose, Factor 3 "will rarely prove fatal."** *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (citing *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 223). Here, EchoCraft's critical purpose justifies the copying. Factor 3 therefore weighs at most slightly against EchoCraft—and this slight weight is overwhelmed by the strong transformativeness of Factor 1.

### D. FACTOR FOUR: EFFECT OF THE USE UPON THE POTENTIAL MARKET

Factor 4 requires courts to consider "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work." 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). The question is whether EchoCraft's song "usurps the market for the original by offering a competing substitute." *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 38 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 181 (2d Cir. 2024)). It does not.

#### 1. Riven Had No Established Licensing Market

**Market effect analysis focuses on "traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets."** *Castle Rock Ent., Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Grp., Inc.*, 150 F.3d 132, 145 (2d Cir. 1998). Riven had no such market for his song. Riven's negotiations with Columbia Grammar were preliminary. The record shows Riven received a $500 "preliminary negotiation fee," but no contract was ever drafted or signed. (Record p. 85).

**This single preliminary discussion does not establish a market.** In *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, the Second Circuit held that "regular" and "frequently" granted licensing requests are required to show a market. 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016). A single discussion, especially one that ended before any contract materialized, is insufficient. A "market" that consists of one failed preliminary negotiation is no market at all.

#### 2. No Derivative Market for Criticism of One's Own Work

**Riven would never license a song criticizing his own work.** This is precisely what *Campbell* recognized when it held that "the unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market." 510 U.S. at 592. EchoCraft's song falls squarely within this category. It critiques Riven's "incomplete" storytelling and his "polished and mellowed" phrases.

**The Second Circuit confirmed this principle in *Santos*.** The court held that "creators do not typically license uses that are critical of or hostile to their own work." 154 F.4th at 40. Because no such licensing market exists, "criticisms will rarely cause cognizable market harm." *Id.*

#### 3. Columbia Grammar's Choice Reflects Different Educational Function

**Riven points to Columbia Grammar's decision as evidence of market substitution.** But Principal Toobin did not choose EchoCraft's song because it was "better," rather, because it is critical. Toobin testified that EchoCraft's song would "solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy." Toobin Dep. at 86. This is not the same purpose as Riven's song, which aids rote memorization. These are different educational functions.

**Importantly, EchoCraft does not claim its song is "more accurate" or "better history."** That framing would invite substitution analysis—treating EchoCraft's version as a "remaster" of Riven's. Courts have rejected fair use claims in such circumstances. See *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 180. EchoCraft's song does not replace Riven's. It interrogates Riven's narrative choices. That is not substitution. Factor 4 therefore weighs in favor of fair use.

### E. FACTOR TWO: NATURE OF THE COPYRIGHTED WORK

Factor 2 considers "the nature of the copyrighted work," recognizing that creative works receive greater protection than factual works. 17 U.S.C. § 107(2). Riven's song is a creative work, and this factor weighs slightly against EchoCraft. But its weight is limited.

Riven's song contains both creative expression and historical facts. The creative elements are protectable, but the historical facts—dates, signals, towns—are not. *Feist*, 499 U.S. at 347-48. Moreover, Factor 2 "has rarely been determinative" in fair use analysis. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586. Factor 2 therefore weighs slightly against EchoCraft, but this slight weight is overwhelmed by the strong transformativeness of Factor 1.

### F. HOLISTIC ANALYSIS

The four fair use factors must be considered together.

**Factor 1 dominates this analysis.** EchoCraft's song is highly transformative—it critiques Riven's own song, not history itself. Under *Santos*, "[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors." 154 F.4th at 39. Factor 3 poses no barrier because copying was necessary to "conjure up" the original. Factor 4 favors fair use because no licensing market exists for criticism. Factor 2 is of limited weight.

**Taken together, these factors compel a finding of fair use.** Copyright law aims to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8. That progress depends on the ability to critique existing works and question established narratives. EchoCraft's song advances this constitutional purpose.

---

## CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the district court correctly granted summary judgment for EchoCraft. EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" is a fair use of Riven's copyrighted work because it serves a fundamentally different purpose—critical inquiry about Riven's own song—rather than substituting for Riven's celebratory original in the educational market. The four-factor test overwhelmingly favors fair use: Factor 1 (transformativeness) weighs decisively; Factor 3 (amount) poses no barrier because copying was necessary for critique; Factor 4 (market effect) favors fair use because no licensing market exists for criticism of one's own work; and Factor 2 (nature) carries only limited weight. On these undisputed facts, fair use is a matter of law. This Court should affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.

Respectfully submitted,
