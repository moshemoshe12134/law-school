**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

This case is about a Title VII retaliation claim. It centers around Philip Riven, a citizen and domiciliary of New York, who is a former employee of EchoCraft Productions (also domiciled in New York) which is a New York City-based record company with other offices across the country. R. at 5\. Riven has accused EchoCraft of terminating his employment as a result of a Title VII investigation he conducted regarding disparities in bonus payments between sexes at EchoCraft. *Id.* Riven was hired by and joined EchoCraft on September 4, 2018 until his employment was terminated on December 21, 2023, thus working approximately five years and three and a half months at EchoCraft. R. at 7\.  
At the beginning of 2020, Riven was promoted from his previous position to manager of the country song-writing department due to his strong performance. R. at 6\. Riven continued his excellent performance for the next two years and received positive reviews from Daphne Sniff, the head of the songwriting division at EchoCraft, in both 2021 and 2022\. R. at 14\. However, it was stated in Riven’s 2022 review that Riven sometimes spent his time at work on personal projects, and that “He has a bright future **if** he keeps it up.” R. at 90\.  At a company holiday party on December 21, 2022, Riven was made aware by his colleague, Jackie Moses, of a potential issue related to bonuses \- that employees in her department at EchoCraft, who happened to be mostly women, were being paid lower bonuses than those in Riven’s department, which was predominantly male. R. at 6\.   
On January 10, 2023, Riven approached Daphne Sniff about the potential issue and was given permission from Sniff to “poke around,” although Sniff stated that she did not believe there was an issue. *Id*. Thus, Riven began looking into the issue of discrepancies in bonuses between different departments at EchoCraft, some of which were more dominated by females. R. at 7\. As such, between January and May of 2023, Riven met with about 81 EchoCraft employees across 12 or so departments, asking them about their salaries, performance reviews, and bonuses. *Id*.  
In the first half of 2023, Riven’s department failed to meet their song quotas for six months straight, and Riven was issued a warning by Sniff about his poor performance on July 5, 2023\. R. at 7\. Riven’s downward trend continued, and he failed to meet his quotas in both the third and fourth quarters of 2023, with his department producing even fewer songs than they had produced in the first two quarters. R. at 93\.  Riven received his official termination letter from EchoCraft on December 21, 2023\. R. at 7\.*.*  
Riven’s colleague, Jackie Moses, was also informed in July of 2023 that her department failed to meet their quota, but Moses was not issued a formal warning and was not terminated. *Id*.  Moses had 18 more years of experience at EchoCraft than Riven, and her performance rebounded in the second half of 2023\. R. at 49\. Riven alleges that he was fired due to his ongoing investigation of women’s bonuses, thus being a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 199\. R. at 5\. EchoCraft argues that Riven was terminated solely as a result of his poor performance. R. at 50\. 

ARGUMENT

1. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR ECHOCRAFT PRODUCTIONS AND DISMISSING RIVEN’S RETALIATION CLAIM FOR LACK OF PRIMA FACIE CASE.

   

The District court ruled that Riven failed to establish a *prima facie* claim of retaliation and thus granted Summary Judgment for EchoCraft Productions. In order to establish a *prima facie* claim of retaliation, a Plaintiff must prove that \-  (1) they participated in a protected activity, (2) that the defendant knew of the protected activity, (3) that a materially adverse action was taken against him, and (4) that there was a relationship or causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. *Littlejohn v. City of New York,* 795 F.3d 297, 315-16 (2015). Riven has failed to meet that burden, and the district court’s recognition of this failure is correct. As such, its ruling should be affirmed, and summary judgment, which “is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural shortcut but as an integral part of the procedure as a whole,” should be granted. *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*, 477 U.S. 317 (1986).

As such, this brief will convincingly demonstrate that Riven did not meet all four elements of the criteria set out above to establish a *prima facie* case. Nonetheless, EchoCraft does agree to the third prong \- that adverse action was taken against Riven (not as a result of his investigation however). It is the first, second, and last prong that this brief will discuss, analyze and ultimately argue were not met.

1. Riven did not participate in a protected activity under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3

   

1. Riven’s investigation of the bonus payments in various groups across the company does not meet the element of participation in a protected activity under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.  
   

Riven’s investigation of the bonus payments in various groups across the company does not meet the element of participation in a protected activity because the evidence suggests that he was merely investigating disparities in bonus payments across various groups, and not specifically sex based disparities.  
As set out in *Crawford v. Metropolitan Government*, 555 U.S. 271, 129 S.Ct. 846 (2009), yjr Title VII anti-retaliation provision forbids retaliation based on an employee's participation in an investigation under Title VII. The anti-retaliation provision of Title VII states that only “investigations under Title VII” are protected, which implies that investigations that do not fall squarely within the ambit of Title VII are not protected by this clause.   
In our case, Riven was merely informed by Jackie Moses and her employees that employees in her group were receiving lower bonuses than employees in Riven’s group with the same performance reviews. R. at 6\. While it is true that the vast majority of Moses’ group was composed of women, there's little evidence the investigation was about gender as opposed to merely investigating bonuses- in fact, all Riven sought out to do when raising the matter with Daphne Sniff was “express their concerns about discrepancies in bonuses between the departments.” *Id*. Furthermore, Riven investigated 81 employees across 12 departments asking them about their performance reviews, bonuses and base salaries, R. at 7\. Had the focus of the investigation been about gender, Riven likely would have structured his investigation more efficiently to interview men and women separately and then compare results, as opposed to structuring his investigation by department. 

2. Findings of an investigation that reveal disparities in pay between genders is not equivalent to an investigation protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.  
   

Findings of an investigation that reveal disparities in pay between genders is not equivalent to an investigation protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.  
As established in *Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden*, 532 U.S. 268 (2001), an investigation is only considered protected if a reasonable person believed it to be a Title VII issue at the time the investigation was commenced. As such, results which later reveal gender discrimination do not retroactively make the investigation protected.  
While it's true that in Riven’s report to Sniff he explicitly flagged the fact that men tended to receive higher bonuses across various divisions at EchoCraft, that was not the initial purpose of the investigation. R. at 25\. Initially, Riven was also “skeptical” of Mses’ departments sex discrimination claims, and merely agreed to “look into it.” R. at 22\. The fact that Riven ultimately did find disparities amongst many groups in bonuses between men and women does not change the fact that his investigation was originally launched merely in order to “look into” bonuses across EchoCraft. As demonstrated by *Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden*, 532 U.S. 268 (2001), we must only consider what Riven believed at the time he launched the investigation, and at that time, he merely entertained the idea that the investigation was about sex disparity. R. at 23\.

2\. Defendant Did Not Know of Protected Activity  
	The second element that Plaintiff must prove to establish a prima facie case of retaliation is that the defendant knew of a protected activity. *Littlejohn v. City of New York*, 795 F.3d  
297, 315-16 (2015). Here, there is little evidence that either Daphne Sniff or Ryan Raine, the parties who ultimately decided to terminate Riven, were aware that Riven was involved in a gender discrimination investigation.  
When Riven first brought up the issue of bonuses with Daphne Sniff, very little indication was given by Riven if any at all that this investigation would center around the underpayment of females at EchoCraft. Riven does not remember if he mentioned gender in this conversation, and Sniff merely remembers him commenting about “the women in Jackie’s department.” R. at 44\. Furthermore, Sniff merely gave Riven permission to “poke around,” and did not imply anywhere that she believed Riven was conducting an investigation protected by Title VII. R. at 45\. In Riven’s communications with Sniff, he titled the subject of his report “Bonus Awards,” framing the discussion as an issue related to bonuses, not gender. R. at 93\. In the email, Riven only made one reference to gender, thus demonstrating little reason to believe that Sniff believed this was a gender based investigation. R. at 76\. Moreover, CEO Ryan Raine was not even aware of Riven’s findings when he signed off on the decision to terminate Riven’s employment after 12 months of underperformance. *Id.*

3\.  There is no relationship or causal connection between the protected activity and adverse action.  
	The first two parts of this argument sought to demonstrate Riven’s failure to meet the first and second elements of establishing a *prima facie claim*, proving that the plaintiff was not involved in a protected activity. While we still believe this to be true,  the following section argues that even IF somehow the first element was met, the fourth element of establishing a relationship or causal connection between the protected activity and adverse action was not met by the Plaintiff.

1. Plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between the protected activity and adverse action due to the amount of time elapsed in between the beginning of the investigation and the termination.

 In a Title VII retaliation action, a plaintiff can indirectly establish a causal connection by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse employment action. *Knox v. CRC Management Co*., LLC, 134 F.4th 39 (2d Cir. 2025).  Similarly, as affirmed in the second circuit, the longer the period of time between the protected activity and the plaintiff's discharge, the greater the likelihood that the defendant will be able to rebut the plaintiff's claim of causation *Rosinski v. American Axle & Mfg., Inc*., 663 F. Supp. 2d 197 (W.D.N.Y. 2009), aff’d, 402 F. App’x 535 (2d Cir. 2010).  
In our case, a large amount of time elapsed between when Daphne Sniff first learned of Riven’s project and when Riven was actually terminated. Riven approached Daphne Sniff about the potential issue in bonus awards on Jan. 10, 2023 and was only terminated on Dec. 21, 2023, almost a full twelve months after he began his investigation. R. at 6\.  Furthermore, Riven emailed his findings to Sniff on August 18, 2023, over four months before he was terminated. R. at 7\. As such, in the four months before Riven’s termination, he was no longer engaged in any activities related to his “investigation.” Perhaps more convincingly, if EchoCraft wanted to prevent Riven from performing his investigation which may yield negative results, why they only be terminated after he had sent in the results of his investigation \- at that point, the “damage” by Riven had been done, and termination would not prevent him from continuing his investigation. While it is true that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3 clearly states that a retaliation claim exists even after an investigation is concluded, in our case, there is still a major gap in time between the conclusion of the investigation and Riven’s termination, which weakens the causal connection in this case. 

2. Riven fails to prove the “but for” causation test set out in University of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338 (2013), as there is overwhelming evidence suggesting that Riven was fired due to his poor performance. 

Even if the Plaintiff can successfully argue that there is nothing dubious about the length of time between Riven’s investigation and his termination, Plaintiff still fails to prove the “but for” causation test set out in *University of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar*, 570 U.S. 338 (2013). There is overwhelming evidence suggesting that Riven was fired due to his poor performance, not his investigation.  
As set out in University of *Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar*, 570 U.S. 338 (2013), to establish a causal connection between the protected activity and termination, the causation established must be but for. To state this standard simply for our case: had Riven not participated in the investigation, he would not have been fired.   
However, the facts of our case paint a clear picture of an employee who was merely fired for underperformance. Before discussing Riven’s underperformance in 2023, it is important to note that flaws in Riven’s performance were raised even before he began looking into the bonuses. In Riven’s overall positive 2022 performance review,  it was noted that Riven sometimes spent his time on personal projects, which would be okay as long as this did not cause an issue with his work/performance, the obvious implication being there would be an issue if he was not performing well. R. at 90\.  This review was written before Riven even undertook his investigation. Furthermore, the 2022 report states that “He (Riven) has a bright future if he keeps it up,” implying that Riven’s future at the company was contingent on good performance, even before he undertook the investigation. *Id.*  
Most obviously, Riven did not meet his quota for six consecutive months before receiving his warning in July, which points to clear and consistent underperformance as manager of the country song writing team. R. at 7\. Moreover, Riven’s performance deteriorated further as the year went on, not even hitting 15 songs during the third and fourth quarter (while his fourth quarter was technically incomplete, he was terminated only ten days before the quarter ended). R at 93\.  
	While the Plaintiff will argue that Jackie Moses had also been underperforming and yet did not receive a formal warning and was not terminated, which Plaintiff will argue points to “but for” causation for Riven’s termination, it is important to note that Moses had worked for EchoCraft for a full 20 years longer than Riven, and had a more proven tracked record. Furthermore, Moses described herself as an “institution” with ties in the industry that nobody else at EchoCraft has. R. at 49\. Furthermore, it is not fair to compare what the company expected of Riven and Moses. Perhaps EchoCraft believed that Moses’ failure to meet quotas was much more reasonable because she had a less talented team. Perhaps EchoCraft expected Moses’ department to generate less revenue than Riven’s. In addition to longevity, there are many reasons why EchoCraft may have treated Moses’ failure to meet quotas more favorably, and it is unfair to compare the treatment of two managers when there are so many potential distinguishable factors.   
In addition to not meeting quotas and thus not producing satisfying results, Riven also demonstrated a lack of effort in 2023 that he had not shown in previous years. For example, Riven did not attend the Annual Conference for country songwriters in 2023, a conference he managed to attend in both 2021 and 2022\. R. at 16\. While Riven states that he skipped the conference to attend his daughter’s piano recital, which in and of itself is understandable, skipping the conference plus his failure to meet quotas in the aggregate point to a lack of motivation and leadership.  
Now, Plaintiff may seek to argue in defense that the reason he failed to meet such expectations was because he was engaged in an investigation, and thus, he is being terminated as a direct result of his participation in an investigation. However, adjacent case law states that an employee may be fired for failing to perform core job duties as a result of a Title VII investigation. G*ogel v. Kia Motors Mfg. of Ga.*, Inc., 967 F.3d 1121 (11th Cir. 2020\) (en banc). In *Gogel v. Kia Motors Mfg. of Ga*., Inc., 967 F.3d 1121 (11th Cir. 2020), the eleventh circuit ruled in an en banc opinion that a manager’s persuasion of a colleague to take action against Kia was not protected activity under Title VII because the conduct fundamentally conflicted with her core job duties. Our case in analogous \- while the actual conduct Riven was investigating could be perceived as protected (although we think not, see above), the amount of time Riven was spending on this investigation was interfering with his core job duties.   
And there is evidence that it was the allocation of time that bothered EchoCraft more than the actual nature of the investigation. On (or about) August 19, 2023, in response to Riven’s email with his findings, Sniff responded, “I take these concerns very seriously. However, are you sure this is the best use of your time right now.” R. at 7\.  It is clear from Sniff’s response that the EchoCraft management was more concerned with Riven’s allocation of his time than the nature of his investigation. As established, Riven should not be protected under title VII if his Title VII investigation was preventing him from performing his core duties.  
While the Plaintiff will argue that the eleventh circuit decision is not technically binding on the second circuit because it is merely an adjacent court and not a precedent from the Supreme Court or second circuit itself, we believe that the findings of the eleventh circuit are logical and should clearly be adopted. If not adopted, what would prevent an employee from spending 80 percent of his hours at work on a Title VII investigation and collecting a paycheck for it? There needs to be a limitation to the Title VII protection, and failure to perform core job duties as a result of an investigation is clearly within the ambit of something that should be a fireable offense.
