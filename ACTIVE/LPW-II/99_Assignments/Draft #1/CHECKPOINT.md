## CRITICAL STRATEGIC REMINDERS

**What EchoCraft's Song IS:**
- A critique of **RIVEN'S SONG** (not history itself)
- Targets Riven's unnuanced, adulatory narrative about Paul Revere
- Question mark signals interrogation of Riven's narrative choices

**What EchoCraft's Song is NOT:**
- "More accurate history" (remaster trap - avoid this framing)
- "Teaching history better" (same purpose as Riven = substitution)
- About Paul Revere himself (it's about Riven's portrayal)

**⚠️ HANDLING RAINE'S "MORE ACCURATE" TESTIMONY:**
- DO NOT quote Raine's "more accurate" language directly (Record p. 75)
- Reframe as "questioning the completeness of Riven's narrative"
- Use Toobin's testimony instead: "critical discussion about Revere's legacy" (Record p. 86)
- Focus on different function (criticism vs. celebration), NOT better content

**Market Effect Frame:**
- Schools preferred "critical discussion pedagogy over rote memorization"
- Different educational function, NOT substitution

**Cases to Use:**
- Campbell, Santos, Authors Guild, Cariou, TCA Television (helpful)
- Warhol, Hachette (harmful but distinguishable)

**Warhol Distinction (Critical for Factor 1):**
- Warhol: Both works served IDENTICAL purpose (magazine illustration)
- EchoCraft: Different purpose (critical inquiry vs. celebration)
- Use the factual comparison table in Plan Part 3.V
