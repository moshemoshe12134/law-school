## II. THE SONGS (LYRICS AND COPYING)

### A. Riven's Original Song - "Revere Paul Revere" (Exhibit G)

**Location in Record:** Page 98

**Full Lyrics (8 lines, 66 words):**
```
Revere Paul Revere
It was the night of April 18, 1775
A night made famous by Paul's historic ride
One if by land Two if By Sea
Such was Revere's Signal to Warn of The Enemy
Through Somerville, Arlington, and Medford he rode
The British are Coming, the great man bellowed
Captured at gunpoint by the soldiers of the British
He revealed no secrets, the man was not skittish.
```

### B. EchoCraft's Song - "Revere Paul Revere?" (Exhibit H)

**Location in Record:** Page 98-99

**Full Lyrics (14 lines, 125 words):**
```
Revere Paul Revere?
It was the night of April 18, 1775,
a night made famous by Paul's historic ride.
One if by land, two if by sea—
such was Revere's signal to warn of the enemy,
though others helped raise that warning's light.
Through Somerville, Arlington, and Medford he rode—
yet he was not the only rider on that road.
The British are coming, the great man bellowed—
a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed.
Captured at gunpoint by the soldiers of the British,
He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish—
The tale often stops with him, though many stood ready.
So the ride we recall is brave, but incomplete:
So let's remember the others who also helped defeat.
```
