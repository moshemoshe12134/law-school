PHILIP RIVEN,

Plaintiff-Appellant,

v.

ECHOCRAFT PRODUCTIONS,

Defendant-Appellee.

On Appeal from the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York

**BRIEF FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLEE ECHOCRAFT PRODUCTIONS**

---

## QUESTION PRESENTED

Whether the district court properly granted summary judgment holding that EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" constitutes fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 where EchoCraft:

1.  **Transformed Riven's celebratory original into critical inquiry** by adding a question mark to the title and changing key lyrics to question Riven's unnuanced portrayal of Paul Revere; and
2.  **Riven had no established licensing market**—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never resulted in a signed contract.

---

## SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" is a fair use of Riven's copyrighted work because it serves a fundamentally different purpose—critical inquiry about Riven's own song—rather than substituting for Riven's celebratory original in the educational market. The district court correctly granted summary judgment because fair use is a question of law on undisputed facts, and the four-factor test overwhelmingly favors EchoCraft.

**Factor 1—purpose and character—weighs decisively in EchoCraft's favor.** Under *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, a use is transformative when it "adds something new, with a further purpose or different character" rather than merely superseding the original. 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994). Unlike in *Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, where both works served identical commercial purposes, EchoCraft's song targets Riven's unnuanced, adulatory treatment of Paul Revere for criticism. The question mark in the title signals interrogation of Riven's narrative choices, not historical uncertainty. A reasonable observer would recognize that EchoCraft does something Riven would never do—criticize his own song's simplistic hero-worship. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 34 (2d Cir. 2025). This transformativeness "reduc[es] the significance" of any incidental commercialism. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

**Factor 3—amount and substantiality—does not defeat fair use because extensive copying was necessary to conjure up Riven's song for critique.** EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines verbatim, but then "depart[ed] markedly" by adding seven new lines that question Riven's narrative. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580. Parody must be able to "conjure up at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable." *Id.* at 580-81. Much of what was copied consists of unprotectable historical facts—the date of Revere's ride, the "one if by land" signal, the towns through which he rode. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 347-48 (1991) (facts not copyrightable). When the copied content is primarily factual, the quantity matters less. Moreover, *Santos* confirms that even 100% copying may be fair when "the secondary use serves a purpose distinct from the original." 154 F.4th at 38.

**Factor 4—market effect—does not show harmful substitution.** The relevant inquiry is "whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original by offering a competing substitute." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 181 (2d Cir. 2024)). EchoCraft's song does not substitute for Riven's; if anything, it is Riven's copyright claim that would suppress critical discussion of his own work. As *Campbell* recognized, "the unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market." 510 U.S. at 592. Riven had no established licensing market—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never produced a contract. *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016) (single discussion insufficient to establish market). When Columbia Grammar's principal chose EchoCraft's version, she sought "critical discussion about Revere's legacy"—a different educational function from Riven's rote-memorization approach. This pedagogical preference is not market substitution.

**Factor 2—nature of the copyrighted work—weighs slightly against EchoCraft but carries "limited weight" in the fair use analysis.** *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586. Riven's song is a creative work, but it contains substantial factual and informational content about historical events.

**Taken together, these factors compel affirmance.** The strong transformativeness of EchoCraft's critical purpose dominates the analysis. *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 36 ("[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors"). Summary judgment was proper because fair use is a legal question on undisputed facts, and no genuine dispute exists that would preclude fair use as a matter of law. This Court should affirm.

## ARGUMENT

### A. Standard of Review

This Court reviews a district court's grant of summary judgment *de novo*. *Jacobsen v. Occupational Health & Rehab. Ctr.*, 229 F.3d 210, 213 (2d Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is appropriate when "no genuine dispute as to any material fact" exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

Fair use is a question of law, not fact. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 32 (2d Cir. 2025); *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 587 n.15 (1994) ("fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, but one best resolved on a case-by-case basis in the context of a particular case"). The four-factor analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107(1)-(4) requires a court to make "normative judgments about the expressive purpose of a work." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 32. These judgments are legal conclusions subject to *de novo* review. *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 213 (2d Cir. 2015).

When material facts are undisputed, as here, the district court must determine fair use as a matter of law. The parties have stipulated that Riven's copyright is valid and that the only issue is fair use. Stip. ¶ 9. The record shows that EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven's song, added seven new lines, released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary, and that Riven had no signed licensing agreements. These facts are not in genuine dispute. The only question is whether those undisputed facts constitute fair use—a legal question for the court.

Accordingly, this Court should affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment if the four-factor test, applied to the undisputed facts, shows that EchoCraft's use was fair as a matter of law.

### B. Factor 1: Purpose and Character of the Use

Factor 1 "is undoubtedly the single most important" factor in the fair use analysis. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 36 (2d Cir. 2025). This factor asks "whether the new work merely 'supersede[s] the objects' of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character." *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994). EchoCraft's song does something fundamentally different from Riven's—it critiques Riven's own song. This transformativeness, combined with educational distribution, makes Factor 1 weigh decisively in EchoCraft's favor.

#### 1. EchoCraft's Song Targets Riven's Song, Not History Itself

The critical question is what EchoCraft's song targets for criticism. EchoCraft does not use Riven's song to teach about Paul Revere. Both songs are about Paul Revere. Rather, EchoCraft uses Riven's song to critique Riven's *portrayal* of Paul Revere.

The question mark in the title—"Revere Paul Revere?"—signals this shift. Riven's title is a command: "Revere Paul Revere." EchoCraft adds a question mark, transforming command into interrogation. The question mark does not express doubt about historical facts. It expresses doubt about *Riven's narrative choices*.

EchoCraft's changes target Riven's celebratory approach. Where Riven sings "The British are Coming, the great man bellowed," EchoCraft responds: "The British are coming, the great man bellowed— / a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed." Exhibit H. This critiques Riven's phrase, not Revere's actions. Where Riven claims "He revealed no secrets, the man was not skittish," EchoCraft corrects: "He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish." *Id.* This exposes Riven's historical inaccuracies—but the target remains Riven's song, not Revere himself.

EchoCraft's lead songwriter explained this purpose. Jordan Raine testified that Riven's original was "all about celebrating Paul Revere, but that's just totally wrongheaded." Raine Test. at 71. EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" to point out that the original story is "incomplete." *Id.* at 72. This is criticism of Riven's song, not teaching about history.

This distinction matters. In *Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, the Supreme Court found no transformativeness because both works served the same purpose: an illustration for a magazine article about Prince. 598 U.S. 508, 526 (2023). Warhol's image did not critique Goldsmith's photograph. It simply repurposed it for the same commercial use. Here, by contrast, EchoCraft does something Riven would never do—criticize his own song's simplistic hero-worship. That is transformative.

#### 2. The "Reasonable Observer" Test Confirms Transformativeness

Transformativeness turns on what a reasonable observer thinks, not the author's subjective intent. *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 34; *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 216 (2d Cir. 2015) (asking what a "reasonable person" would perceive).

A reasonable observer comparing the two songs would recognize EchoCraft's critique. The observer would see:
- Identical opening lines establishing the baseline narrative
- New lines immediately qualifying that narrative ("though others helped raise that warning's light")
- Direct commentary on Riven's choices ("a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed")
- A final message about incomplete storytelling ("the ride we recall is brave, but incomplete")

This structure signals criticism, not substitution. The observer would understand that EchoCraft quotes Riven to question Riven's approach—precisely the kind of critical engagement that fair use exists to protect. See *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580 (parody "must be able to 'conjure up' at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable").

#### 3. EchoCraft's Song Serves a Different Educational Function

Riven's song teaches through rote memorization. The lyrics present a straightforward narrative: dates, events, names, locations. Exhibit G. This aids memorization, not critical thinking.

EchoCraft's song teaches through critical discussion. Columbia Grammar's principal testified that EchoCraft's song would "solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy" and that "there are educational benefits to asking questions about Paul Revere's legacy." Toobin Test. at 86. This is a different pedagogical function.

When the school chose EchoCraft's version, it chose critical discussion over rote memorization. These are not substitutes in the same market. They are different educational tools serving different purposes. Cf. *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 216 (finding transformative use where "Google's use of the copyrighted works serves a very different function" than the originals).

Importantly, EchoCraft avoids the "remaster trap." Courts have rejected fair use claims where the secondary work merely "remasters" the original—making it more accurate or better while serving the same purpose. See, e.g., *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 180 (2d Cir. 2024) (finding no fair use when defendant made books available for "lending" in the same manner as libraries). EchoCraft does not claim to teach history "better." It claims to question Riven's narrative choices. That is different.

#### 4. Nonprofit Educational Distribution Favors Fair Use

Factor 1 considers whether a use "is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). EchoCraft's song was released through EchoCraft Ed, the company's "not-for-profit education division." Raine Test. at 72.

EchoCraft charged schools $200 per license—below cost. Raine testified that "the amount we charged was below the cost to us to produce and distribute it, so we did not make a profit." Raine Test. at 76. The division's goal was to generate "significant good will," not revenue. Raine Test. at 74.

True, EchoCraft's parent company is a for-profit record label. But incidental commercial benefit does not make a use non-transformative. In *Santos*, the Second Circuit found fair use even though Kimmel's podcast was commercial and profitable. 154 F.4th at 39. The court emphasized that "the more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors, including commercialism." *Id.* (quoting *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579). The same principle applies here. Strong transformativeness "may well excuse" any incidental commercialism. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

#### 5. Factor 1 Weighs Decisively for EchoCraft

Taken together, these considerations make Factor 1 the centerpiece of EchoCraft's fair use claim. EchoCraft's song:
- Targets Riven's song for criticism, not history itself
- Uses a question mark and lyrical changes to signal interrogation
- Serves a different educational function (critical discussion vs. memorization)
- Was distributed through a nonprofit educational division at below cost

Under *Santos*, "[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors, including commercialism." 154 F.4th at 39 (quoting *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579). EchoCraft's use is highly transformative. Factor 1 therefore weighs decisively in favor of fair use and "reduces the significance" of the remaining factors. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

### C. Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used

Factor 3 examines "the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole." 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven's song, plus 57 of 66 words. This extensive copying would normally weigh against fair use. But when copying is necessary for criticism, as here, Factor 3 poses no barrier to fair use.

#### 1. EchoCraft Acknowledges—and Explains—Its Extensive Copying

The quantity is undisputed. Riven testified that "seven of the lines are identical." Riven Test. at 30. Raine confirmed: "Yeah, that sounds right, but it's the changes that make all the difference." Raine Test. at 71.

But quantity alone is not disqualifying. In *Santos*, the Second Circuit held that "the extent of a copying can be overshadowed by the highly transformative purpose of the secondary work." 154 F.4th at 38 (citing *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 223). Indeed, *Santos* affirmed fair use even though Kimmel copied 100% of the defendants' social media posts. *Id.* at 37. When the secondary use serves a different purpose, extensive copying may be justified.

There are "no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered fair use." *Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, 803 F.2d 1253, 1263 (2d Cir. 1986). The quantity must be reasonable in relation to the purpose. Because the purpose here is direct criticism of Riven's specific factual claims, reproducing those claims was necessary.

#### 2. The "Conjure Up" Doctrine Justifies Copying the Heart of the Work

Parody and criticism require recognition. As the Supreme Court explained in *Campbell*, "parody must be able to 'conjure up' at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable." 510 U.S. at 580-81. This recognition requirement often justifies copying the "heart" of the original work.

The Court specifically rejected a quantitative approach in *Campbell*. 2 Live Crew copied the bassline and opening verse of "Pretty Woman"—the most recognizable parts. The Court held that "copy does not become excessive in relation to parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the original's heart." *Id.* at 586. What matters is whether the copying is justified by the parodic purpose.

The same principle applies here. EchoCraft could not critique Riven's song without first establishing what Riven's song says. The identical opening lines—"Revere Paul Revere / It was the night of April 18, 1775"—serve this recognition function. They conjure up Riven's narrative before questioning it. This is precisely what *Campbell* permits.

#### 3. Much of What Was Copied Consists of Unprotectable Facts

Historical facts are not copyrightable. In *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, the Supreme Court held that "facts and data, as opposed to their original expression, are not copyrightable." 499 U.S. 340, 364 (1991).

Riven's song contains substantial factual content:
- "April 18, 1775" — historical date
- "One if by land Two if By Sea" — historical signal code
- "Somerville, Arlington, and Medford" — geographic route
- "The British are Coming" — historical phrase (though apocryphal)

These facts belong to history, not Riven. EchoCraft's use of these facts does not infringe Riven's copyright. *Feist*, 499 U.S. at 364-65. Factor 3 should be interpreted to exclude unprotectable factual content from the "substantiality" inquiry. See *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586 (acknowledging that factual works receive less protection).

#### 4. EchoCraft "Depart[ed] Markedly" with New Content

After copying Riven's lines, EchoCraft added seven new lines—50% of the final song. These new lines transform the work:
- "though others helped raise that warning's light" — corrects Riven's omission
- "yet he was not the only rider on that road" — adds missing context
- "a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed" — critiques Riven's phrase
- "So let's remember the others who also helped defeat" — proposes alternative

The Supreme Court in *Campbell* emphasized that parody "must 'comment on' the original or criticize it." 510 U.S. at 581 (quoting *Fisher v. Dees*, 794 F.2d 432, 437 (9th Cir. 1986)). EchoCraft's new lines provide this commentary. They do not merely remix Riven's content; they interrogate it.

The structure matters. EchoCraft establishes Riven's narrative, then immediately qualifies it ("though others helped"), then critiques it ("a line the storytellers favor"), then concludes with a call to remember others. This is not mere variation. It is critical engagement—precisely the kind of expressive work that fair use exists to enable.

#### 5. Factor 3 Does Not Preclude Fair Use

Taken together, these considerations show that Factor 3 poses no barrier to fair use. EchoCraft copied extensively, but:
- The copying was necessary to "conjure up" Riven's song for critique (*Campbell*)
- Much of what was copied consists of unprotectable historical facts (*Feist*)
- EchoCraft "departed markedly" by adding seven new lines that transform the work (*Campbell*)

When the secondary use serves a different purpose, Factor 3 "will rarely prove fatal." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (citing *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 223). Here, EchoCraft's critical purpose justifies the copying. Factor 3 therefore weighs at most slightly against EchoCraft—and this slight weight is overwhelmed by the strong transformativeness of Factor 1.

### D. Factor 4: Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market

Factor 4 requires courts to consider "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work." 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). This is not merely a question of whether Riven lost a licensing opportunity. The question is whether EchoCraft's song "usurps the market for the original by offering a competing substitute." *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 38 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 181 (2d Cir. 2024)). EchoCraft's song does not substitute for Riven's. It serves a different educational function. Factor 4 therefore favors fair use.

#### 1. The Legal Framework: Substitution vs. Suppression

The critical distinction is between substitution and critical suppression. As the Second Circuit explained in *Hachette*, "we ask not whether the second work would damage the market for the first...but whether it usurps the market for the first by offering a competing substitute." 115 F.4th at 181 (emphasis in original). Fair use does not protect "competing substitutes," but it does protect "critical reviews or lampoons" that may incidentally suppress demand. *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 592 (1994).

The Supreme Court in *Campbell* rejected the notion that every lost licensing opportunity equals market harm. The Court emphasized that "copyright is not a tax on readership," and that fair use inherently involves some loss of royalty revenue. *Id.* at 591-92. What matters is whether the secondary use "occup[ies] the same market space as the original." *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 181.

#### 2. Riven Had No Established Licensing Market

Market effect analysis focuses on "traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets." *Castle Rock Ent., Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Grp., Inc.*, 150 F.3d 132, 145 (2d Cir. 1998). Riven had no such market for his song.

Riven's negotiations with Columbia Grammar were preliminary. The record shows:
- Riven received a $500 "preliminary negotiation fee" from Principal Toobin
- Toobin emailed "Sounds good! We'll talk more soon" on January 14, 2024
- Toobin terminated negotiations on February 14, 2024—before EchoCraft even released its song
- No contract was ever drafted. Toobin Test. at 85

This single preliminary discussion does not establish a market. In *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, the Second Circuit held that "regular" and "frequently" granted licensing requests are required to show a market. 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016). A single discussion, especially one that ended before any contract materialized, is insufficient.

Riven's own conduct confirms the lack of market. After Toobin terminated negotiations, Riven "tried reaching out" to other schools, but "no school was receptive." Riven Test. at 31. As of September 2024, "commercial interest in Riven's original composition has effectively vanished." Complaint ¶ 26. A "market" that consists of one failed preliminary negotiation is no market at all.

#### 3. No Derivative Market for Criticism of One's Own Work

Riven would never license a song criticizing his own work. This is precisely what *Campbell* recognized when it held that "the unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market." 510 U.S. at 592.

EchoCraft's song falls squarely within this category. It critiques Riven's "incomplete" storytelling, his "polished and mellowed" phrases, his historical inaccuracies. Exhibit H. Riven would never pay for the privilege of having his work criticized in this way. To treat this as a "lost market" is to rewrite copyright law as a guarantee against criticism.

The Second Circuit confirmed this principle in *Santos*. The court held that "creators do not typically license uses that are critical of or hostile to their own work." 154 F.4th at 40. Because no such licensing market exists, "criticisms will rarely cause cognizable market harm." *Id.* EchoCraft's song is criticism. It causes no cognizable market harm.

#### 4. Columbia Grammar's Choice Reflects Different Educational Function

Riven points to Columbia Grammar's decision as evidence of market substitution. But this misunderstands what happened. Principal Toobin did not choose EchoCraft's song because it was "better." She chose it because it served a different pedagogical purpose.

Toobin testified that EchoCraft's song would "solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy" and that "there are educational benefits to asking questions about Paul Revere's legacy." Toobin Test. at 86. This is not the same purpose as Riven's song, which aids rote memorization of historical facts.

These are different educational functions. A school might use both songs in sequence: first Riven's to establish the narrative, then EchoCraft's to critique it. Indeed, this is precisely how critical pedagogy works. Cf. *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 216 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding different function where Google's book search served research purposes, not reading).

Importantly, EchoCraft does not claim its song is "more accurate" or "better history." That framing would invite substitution analysis—treating EchoCraft's version as a "remaster" of Riven's. Courts have rejected fair use claims in such circumstances. See *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 180 (Internet Archive made books available for "lending" in same manner as libraries). EchoCraft's song does not replace Riven's. It interrogates Riven's narrative choices. That is not substitution.

#### 5. Factor 4 Favors Fair Use

Taken together, these considerations show that Factor 4 favors fair use. EchoCraft's song:
- Does not usurp the same market space as Riven's (*Hachette*)
- Operates in a market that Riven never established—only preliminary negotiations (*TCA Television*)
- Occupies a category of use (criticism of one's own work) that creators do not typically license (*Campbell*, *Santos*)
- Serves a different educational function (critical discussion vs. rote memorization)

Riven's lost preliminary negotiation does not equal market harm. Fair use "inherently involves some loss of royalty revenue." *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 591. What copyright does not protect is "the right to license criticism." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 40. Factor 4 therefore weighs in favor of fair use.

### E. Factor 2: Nature of the Copyrighted Work

Factor 2 considers "the nature of the copyrighted work," recognizing that creative works receive greater protection than factual works. 17 U.S.C. § 107(2). Riven's song is a creative work, and this factor weighs slightly against EchoCraft. But its weight is limited.

Riven's song contains both creative expression and historical facts. The creative elements—word choice, rhyme scheme, narrative perspective—are protectable. But much of the content consists of historical facts: the date of Revere's ride, the "one if by land" signal, the towns on his route. Facts are not copyrightable. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 347-48 (1991).

Moreover, Factor 2 "has rarely been determinative" in the fair use analysis. *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 586 (1994). The Supreme Court cautioned that "all works are entitled to protection," and that Factor 2 "is not likely to help much" in distinguishing fair use from infringement. *Id.* Factor 2 therefore weighs slightly against EchoCraft, but this slight weight is overwhelmed by the strong transformativeness of Factor 1 and the lack of market harm in Factor 4.

### F. Holistic Analysis

The four factors "do not exist in vacuo." *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 36 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 178 (2d Cir. 2024)). They must be considered together, with proper weight given to each based on the circumstances.

Factor 1 dominates this analysis. EchoCraft's song is highly transformative—it critiques Riven's own song, not history itself. It serves a different educational function (critical discussion vs. rote memorization). It was distributed through a nonprofit educational division at below-cost pricing. Under *Santos*, "[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors, including commercialism." 154 F.4th at 39 (quoting *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579).

Factor 3 poses no barrier. EchoCraft copied extensively, but the copying was necessary to "conjure up" Riven's song for critique. Much of what was copied consists of unprotectable historical facts. EchoCraft then "departed markedly" by adding seven new lines that transform the work. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580-81.

Factor 4 favors fair use. Riven had no established licensing market—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never produced a contract. *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016). No derivative market exists for criticism of one's own work, because creators do not typically license such uses. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 592; *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 40.

Factor 2 weighs slightly against EchoCraft, but its weight is limited. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586. The creative nature of Riven's song does not overcome the strong transformativeness of EchoCraft's critical purpose.

Taken together, these factors compel a finding of fair use. Copyright law aims to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8. That progress depends on the ability to critique existing works, to question established narratives, to engage in critical discourse. EchoCraft's song advances this constitutional purpose. The district court correctly found fair use as a matter of law.

### G. Summary Judgment Proper

Summary judgment is appropriate when "no genuine dispute as to any material fact" exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). This Court reviews *de novo*. *Jacobsen v. Occupational Health & Rehab. Ctr.*, 229 F.3d 210, 213 (2d Cir. 2000).

Fair use is a question of law on undisputed facts. *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 32; *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 587 n.15. The parties have stipulated that Riven's copyright is valid. Stip. ¶ 9. The material facts are undisputed:
- EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven's song
- EchoCraft added seven new lines that transform the work
- EchoCraft released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary at below-cost pricing
- Riven had no signed licensing agreements, only preliminary negotiations

The only question is whether these undisputed facts constitute fair use—a legal question for the court. No genuine factual dispute precludes summary judgment. The district court correctly analyzed the four factors and concluded that EchoCraft's use was fair as a matter of law. That decision was correct.

Accordingly, the district court's grant of summary judgment should be affirmed.

## CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the district court correctly granted summary judgment for EchoCraft. EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" is a fair use of Riven's copyrighted work because it serves a fundamentally different purpose—critical inquiry about Riven's own song—rather than substituting for Riven's celebratory original in the educational market. The four-factor test overwhelmingly favors fair use: Factor 1 (transformativeness) weighs decisively; Factor 3 (amount) poses no barrier because copying was necessary for critique; Factor 4 (market effect) favors fair use because no licensing market exists for criticism of one's own work; and Factor 2 (nature) carries only limited weight. On these undisputed facts, fair use is a matter of law. This Court should affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.

Respectfully submitted,
