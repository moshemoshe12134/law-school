# SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

**Draft #1 - EchoCraft (Appellee)**

---

EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" is a fair use of Riven's copyrighted work because it serves a fundamentally different purpose—critical inquiry about Riven's own song—rather than substituting for Riven's celebratory original in the educational market. The district court correctly granted summary judgment because fair use is a question of law on undisputed facts, and the four-factor test overwhelmingly favors EchoCraft.

**Factor 1—purpose and character—weighs decisively in EchoCraft's favor.** Under *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, a use is transformative when it "adds something new, with a further purpose or different character" rather than merely superseding the original. 510 U.S. at 579. Unlike in *Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, where both works served identical commercial purposes, EchoCraft's song targets Riven's unnuanced, adulatory treatment of Paul Revere for criticism. The question mark in the title signals interrogation of Riven's narrative choices, not historical uncertainty. A reasonable observer would recognize that EchoCraft does something Riven would never do—criticize his own song's simplistic hero-worship. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 34 (2d Cir. 2025). This transformativeness "reduc[es] the significance" of any incidental commercialism. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

**Factor 3—amount and substantiality—does not defeat fair use because extensive copying was necessary to conjure up Riven's song for critique.** EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines verbatim, but then "depart[ed] markedly" by adding seven new lines that question Riven's narrative. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580. Parody must be able to "conjure up at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable." *Id.* at 580-81. Much of what was copied consists of unprotectable historical facts—the date of Revere's ride, the "one if by land" signal, the towns through which he rode. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 347-48 (1991) (facts not copyrightable). When the copied content is primarily factual, the quantity matters less. Moreover, *Santos* confirms that even 100% copying may be fair when "the secondary use serves a purpose distinct from the original." 154 F.4th at 38.

**Factor 4—market effect—does not show harmful substitution.** The relevant inquiry is "whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original by offering a competing substitute." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 38 (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 181 (2d Cir. 2024)). EchoCraft's song does not substitute for Riven's; if anything, it is Riven's copyright claim that would suppress critical discussion of his own work. As *Campbell* recognized, "the unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market." 510 U.S. at 592. Riven had no established licensing market—only preliminary negotiations with a single school that never produced a contract. *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016) (single discussion insufficient to establish market). When Columbia Grammar's principal chose EchoCraft's version, she sought "critical discussion about Revere's legacy"—a different educational function from Riven's rote-memorization approach. This pedagogical preference is not market substitution.

**Factor 2—nature of the copyrighted work—weighs slightly against EchoCraft but carries "limited weight" in the fair use analysis.** *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586. Riven's song is a creative work, but it contains substantial factual and informational content about historical events.

**Taken together, these factors compel affirmance.** The strong transformativeness of EchoCraft's critical purpose dominates the analysis. *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 36 ("[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors"). Summary judgment was proper because fair use is a legal question on undisputed facts, and no genuine dispute exists that would preclude fair use as a matter of law. This Court should affirm.

### Strategic Notes:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
- States core theory: different purpose = fair use
- Mentions summary judgment standard
- Roadmaps factor order (F1 → F3 → F4 → F2, NOT numerical)

**Paragraph 2: Factor 1 (Purpose)**
- Campbell transformativeness standard
- Distinguishes Warhol on purpose grounds (same vs. different purpose)
- Santos reasonable observer test
- Reduced significance of commercialism

**Paragraph 3: Factor 3 (Amount)**
- Acknowledges 7 of 8 lines copied forthrightly
- "Conjure up" necessity from Campbell
- "Marked departure" with new content
- Feist: facts not copyrightable
- Santos: 100% copying acceptable when purpose differs

**Paragraph 4: Factor 4 (Market)**
- Correct legal standard: substitution vs. suppression (Santos/Hachette)
- Campbell: no derivative market for criticism
- TCA Television: preliminary negotiations insufficient
- Toobin's choice: critical discussion pedagogy ≠ substitution
- AVOIDS "more accurate" or "better history" framing (remaster trap)

**Paragraph 5: Factor 2 (Nature)**
- Quick concession
- Limited weight per Campbell
- Factual content diminishes protection

**Paragraph 6: Conclusion**
- Holistic analysis
- Factor 1 dominance (Santos quote)
- Summary judgment proper
- Request for affirmance
