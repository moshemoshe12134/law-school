# CONCLUSION

**Draft #1 - EchoCraft (Appellee)**

---

## IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the district court correctly granted summary judgment for EchoCraft. EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" is a fair use of Riven's copyrighted work because it serves a fundamentally different purpose—critical inquiry about Riven's own song—rather than substituting for Riven's celebratory original in the educational market. The four-factor test overwhelmingly favors fair use: Factor 1 (transformativeness) weighs decisively; Factor 3 (amount) poses no barrier because copying was necessary for critique; Factor 4 (market effect) favors fair use because no licensing market exists for criticism of one's own work; and Factor 2 (nature) carries only limited weight. On these undisputed facts, fair use is a matter of law. This Court should affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.

Respectfully submitted,
