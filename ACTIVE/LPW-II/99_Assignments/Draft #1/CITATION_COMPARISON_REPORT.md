# CITATION COMPARISON REPORT: My Version vs. Appellate_Brief_Draft_2.md

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Purpose:** Compare Record citations and identify errors

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Finding:** Both versions contain **significant citation errors**. Neither version consistently cites to the correct Record page numbers. The Record uses line numbers (1-2915) while the briefs cite to "Record p. XX" page numbers that don't align with actual content locations.

**Critical Issue:** The Record appears to be formatted with line numbers, not traditional page numbers. Citations like "Record p. 75" for Raine's testimony are actually citing to line numbers, but the content at those lines doesn't match what's being cited.

## KEY FINDINGS

### Issues with Appellate_Brief_Draft_2.md:

1. **Inconsistent citation format** - Uses "Record p. XX" throughout but page numbers don't consistently match content
2. **Wrong page for Raine's testimony** - cites to Record p. 70-77 when actual testimony spans lines 1944-2173 (appears as pages 70-76)
3. **Mixed citation styles** - Sometimes uses "Record p. XX", sometimes just "Record XX"

### Issues with My Version:

1. **Uses deposition-style citations** - "Raine Test. at 75" and "Toobin Dep. at 86" are clearer but the Record is formatted as trial testimony, not depositions
2. **Relies on Master Fact Sheet** - Many citations reference "Master Fact Sheet at 6" which is a created document, not the Record itself
3. **Some line numbers off by 1** - Raine's "celebrating Paul Revere" testimony is actually on line 1994-1995 (page 71), but I cite to page 75

### Both Versions Have:

1. **"Had anyone drafted that contract"** - Draft_2 correctly cites Record p. 85 (actual line 2398-2399). I cite to Toobin Dep. at 84 (off by 1).
2. **"no school was receptive"** - Draft_2 correctly cites Record p. 31 (actual line 878-879). I cite to Riven Test. at 32 (off by 1).
3. **"Sounds good! We'll talk more soon"** - Neither cites correctly to Exhibit I lines 2897-2898

## RECOMMENDATION

**Both versions have significant citation errors.** The Record is formatted with line numbers (1-2915), and the page numbers shown (e.g., "70", "71", "85") appear to be the original PDF page numbers embedded in the text.

**Best practice:** Use the citation format that matches what's actually in the Record:
- **"Record at 70-76"** for Raine's testimony (pages 70-76 contain lines 1944-2173)
- **"Record at 85-86"** for Toobin's testimony about contracts (page 85 contains lines 2398-2399)
- **"Record at 31"** for Riven's "no school was receptive" (page 31, lines 878-879)
- **"Exhibit H"** for EchoCraft's song
- **"Exhibit G"** for Riven's song
- **"Exhibit I"** for emails

## CRITICAL ERRORS TO FIX

Both versions should be corrected to use consistent citation formats that accurately reflect the Record structure.

| Current Citation (Both) | Should Be |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| "Record p. 70" for Raine's "deep rumination" | Record at 71 (lines 1946-1947) |
| "Toobin Dep. at 84" for contract question | Record at 85 (lines 2398-2399) |
| "Raine Test. at 32" for "no school was receptive" | Record at 31 (lines 878-879) |
| "Record p. 100" for "Sounds good" email | Exhibit I (lines 2897-2898) |
