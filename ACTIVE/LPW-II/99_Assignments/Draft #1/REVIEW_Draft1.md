# DRAFT #1 REVIEW REPORT

**Review Date:** 2026-02-17
**Reviewer:** Claude (Moshe Klein's Brief Draft #1)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Assessment:** My Draft #1 sections are **substantially aligned** with the plan and closely match the Appellate_Brief_Draft_2.md comparison document. The drafts follow the strategic framework, avoid the "remaster trap," and use the correct factor order (F1 → F3 → F4 → F2).

**Key Finding:** My Draft #1 appears to be the **source/inspiration** for Appellate_Brief_Draft_2.md, not the other way around. The comparison document contains additional sections (like "Statutory Presumption" in Factor 1) and some refinements, but the core structure, arguments, and even many phrases are identical.

**Critical Issue Found:** ⚠️ **My Draft #1 includes Raine's "more accurate" testimony** which the plan explicitly warns AGAINST using (see Part 2.V.D of plan).

### 4. FACTOR 1: PURPOSE AND CHARACTER

| Element | Plan Requirement | My Draft #1 | Appellate_Brief_Draft_2 | Status |
|---------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Target analysis | Critiques RIVEN'S SONG, not history | ✅ Present | ✅ Present | ✅ PASS |
| Question mark analysis | Signals interrogation of Riven's choices | ✅ Present | ✅ Present | ✅ PASS |
| Reasonable observer test | Santos standard | ✅ Included | ✅ Included | ✅ PASS |
| Different educational function | Critical discussion vs. rote memorization | ✅ Present | ✅ Present | ✅ PASS |

| **⚠️ Raine "more accurate" testimony** | **Plan says DO NOT USE** | **❌ INCLUDED (line 19)** | **❌ INCLUDED (line 102)** | **⚠️ VIOLATION** |

**Critical Issue - Plan Part 2.V.D Warning:**
> **DO NOT:**
> - Quote Raine's "more accurate" language directly
> - Use "accuracy" as a selling point for EchoCraft's song

**My Draft #1 Line 19:**
> EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" and made the song **"more accurate"** to point out that the original story is "incomplete."

**Comparison Document Line 102:**
> EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" and made the song **"more accurate"** to point out that the original story is "incomplete."

**Recommendation:** Both documents violate the plan's guidance here. Should be revised to:
> EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" to point out that the original story is "incomplete."

**Other differences:** The comparison document includes a "Statutory Presumption" subsection (lines 106-108) that is not in my Draft #1. This references *In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube* and *Rubin v. Brooks/Cole* - cases not in my draft.

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **MOSTLY ALIGNED** but contains plan violation on "more accurate" language.

## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### ⚠️ Issue #1: "More Accurate" Language Violates Plan Guidance

**Location:** Factor 1, line 19 of my Draft #1 (also line 102 of comparison document)

**Plan Warning (Part 2.V.D):**
> **DO NOT:**
> - Quote Raine's "more accurate" language directly
> - Use "accuracy" as a selling point for EchoCraft's song
> - Frame the purpose as "correcting historical errors"

**Current Text:**
> EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" and made the song **"more accurate"** to point out that the original story is "incomplete."

**Recommended Revision:**
> EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" to point out that the original story is "incomplete."

**Reasoning:** The "more accurate" framing triggers the remaster trap - it suggests EchoCraft's song is a better version of Riven's rather than a critique of Riven's narrative choices. Courts have found remasters NOT to be fair use.

---

### ⚠️ Issue #2: Missing "Statutory Presumption" Argument

**Location:** Factor 1

**Comparison Document Includes:**
- "Statutory Presumption of Fair Use" subsection (lines 106-108)
- Cites *In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube* (S.D.N.Y. 2022)
- Cites *Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co.* (D. Mass. 1993)

**My Draft #1:** Does not include this argument

**Assessment:** This is a **gap** rather than an error. The statutory presumption argument could strengthen Factor 1, but it's not required. The cases cited are district court cases from other circuits - persuasive but not controlling.

---

## PLAN COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

| Plan Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| Factor order: F1 → F3 → F4 → F2 | ✅ PASS | Correct throughout |
| Avoid "remaster trap" | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Structure avoids it, but "more accurate" quote violates |
| Target = RIVEN'S SONG, not history | ✅ PASS | Clearly articulated |
| Schools preferring "critical discussion pedagogy" | ✅ PASS | Used consistently |
| Warhol distinction on purpose grounds | ✅ PASS | Clearly explained |
| Santos reasonable observer test | ✅ PASS | Applied correctly |
| Campbell "conjure up" doctrine | ✅ PASS | Applied to Factor 3 |
| TCA Television for preliminary negotiations | ✅ PASS | Applied to Factor 4 |
| No derivative market for criticism | ✅ PASS | Campbell/Santos cited |
| Nonprofit/below-cost pricing | ✅ PASS | Included |
| Bluebook citations | ✅ PASS | Format appears correct |
| Record page citations | ✅ PASS | Included |
| Santos v. Kimmel availability | ✅ PASS | Cited correctly (154 F.4th 30, 2025) |

## MISSING ELEMENTS (Not in Plan Requirements)

The comparison document includes these elements that were NOT in my Draft #1:

1. **Statutory Presumption argument** (Factor 1) - *In re DMCA* and *Rubin* cases
2. **"Percentage of Copying is Not Dispositive" subsection** (Factor 3) - *Maxtone-Graham* case
3. **Statement of the Case** section - Full factual narrative with exhibits

**Assessment:** These are additions/enhancements, not plan violations. The Statement of the Case in the comparison document is a full narrative that my Draft #1 did not include (the plan said to coordinate with partner on this section).

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority

1. **Remove or reframe "more accurate" language** in Factor 1 to comply with plan Part 2.V.D
   - Current: "made the song 'more accurate' to point out..."
   - Recommended: "to point out that the original story is 'incomplete'"

2. **Consider adding Statutory Presumption argument** if wanting to strengthen Factor 1
   - *In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube*, 581 F.Supp.3d 509, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2022)
   - *Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co.*, 836 F.Supp. 909, 917 (D. Mass. 1993)

### Medium Priority

3. **Add "Percentage of Copying is Not Dispositive" subsection** to Factor 3
   - *Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell*, 803 F.2d 1253, 1263 (2d Cir. 1986)
   - This is 2d Circuit authority and directly on point

4. **Verify all Record page numbers** match actual Record document
   - Plan warns against AI hallucination of citations
   - Cross-check against source documents

### Low Priority

5. **Consider Statement of the Case** if not coordinating with partner
   - Comparison document includes full narrative
   - My Draft #1 focused on Argument sections only (as per plan)

---

## CONCLUSION

My Draft #1 is **substantially aligned** with the plan requirements and closely matches the Appellate_Brief_Draft_2.md comparison document. The primary issue is the inclusion of Raine's "more accurate" testimony, which the plan explicitly warns against.

**The comparison document appears to be based on my Draft #1 structure**, with some enhancements (statutory presumption argument) and the same "more accurate" issue carried over.

**Overall Grade:** **A-** (would be A+ without "more accurate" violation)
