# STANDARD OF REVIEW

**Draft #1 - EchoCraft (Appellee)**

## A. Standard of Review

This Court reviews a district court's grant of summary judgment **de novo**. *Jacobsen v. Occupational Health & Rehab. Ctr.*, 229 F.3d 210, 213 (2d Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is appropriate when "no genuine dispute as to any material fact" exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

**Fair use is a question of law, not fact.** *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 32 (2d Cir. 2025); *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 587 n.15 (1994) ("fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, but one best resolved on a case-by-case basis in the context of a particular case"). The four-factor analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107(1)-(4) requires a court to make "normative judgments about the expressive purpose of a work." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 32. These judgments are legal conclusions subject to de novo review. *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 213 (2d Cir. 2015).

When material facts are undisputed, as here, the district court must determine fair use as a matter of law. The parties have stipulated that Riven's copyright is valid and that the only issue is fair use. Stip. ¶ 9. The record shows that EchoCraft copied seven of eight lines from Riven's song, added seven new lines, released the song through its nonprofit educational subsidiary, and that Riven had no signed licensing agreements. These facts are not in genuine dispute. The only question is whether those undisputed facts constitute fair use—a legal question for the court.

Accordingly, this Court should affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment if the four-factor test, applied to the undisputed facts, shows that EchoCraft's use was fair as a matter of law.
