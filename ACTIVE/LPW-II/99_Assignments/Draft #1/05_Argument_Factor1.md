# FACTOR 1: PURPOSE AND CHARACTER

**Draft #1 - EchoCraft (Appellee)**

---

## B. Factor 1: Purpose and Character of the Use

Factor 1 "is undoubtedly the single most important" factor in the fair use analysis. *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 36 (2d Cir. 2025). This factor asks "whether the new work merely 'supersede[s] the objects' of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character." *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994). EchoCraft's song does something fundamentally different from Riven's—it critiques Riven's own song. This transformativeness, combined with educational distribution, makes Factor 1 weigh decisively in EchoCraft's favor.

### 1. EchoCraft's Song Targets Riven's Song, Not History Itself

**The critical question is what EchoCraft's song targets for criticism.** EchoCraft does not use Riven's song to teach about Paul Revere. Both songs are about Paul Revere. Rather, EchoCraft uses Riven's song to critique Riven's *portrayal* of Paul Revere.

**The question mark in the title—"Revere Paul Revere?"—signals this shift.** Riven's title is a command: "Revere Paul Revere." EchoCraft adds a question mark, transforming command into interrogation. The question mark does not express doubt about historical facts. It expresses doubt about *Riven's narrative choices*.

**EchoCraft's changes target Riven's celebratory approach.** Where Riven sings "The British are Coming, the great man bellowed," EchoCraft responds: "The British are coming, the great man bellowed— / a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed." Exhibit H. This critiques Riven's phrase, not Revere's actions. Where Riven claims "He revealed no secrets, the man was not skittish," EchoCraft corrects: "He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish." Id. This exposes Riven's historical inaccuracies—but the target remains Riven's song, not Revere himself.

**EchoCraft's lead songwriter explained this purpose.** Jordan Raine testified that Riven's original was "all about celebrating Paul Revere, but that's just totally wrongheaded." Raine Test. at 75. EchoCraft added lines "mentioning other people" to point out that the original story is "incomplete." Id. This is criticism of Riven's song, not teaching about history.

**This distinction matters.** In *Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, the Supreme Court found no transformativeness because both works served the same purpose: an illustration for a magazine article about Prince. 598 U.S. 508, 526 (2023). Warhol's image did not critique Goldsmith's photograph. It simply repurposed it for the same commercial use. Here, by contrast, EchoCraft does something Riven would never do—criticize his own song's simplistic hero-worship. That is transformative.

### 2. Statutory Presumption of Fair Use

**Federal courts recognize a "strong presumption that factor one favors the defendant if the allegedly infringing work fits the description of uses described in section 107," including criticism and comment.** *In re DMCA Section 512(h) Subpoena to YouTube*, 581 F.Supp.3d 509, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). Works that "fit comfortably within several of the statutory categories" and "further the goals of copyright laws by adding value to prior intellectual labor" satisfy this standard. *Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co.*, 836 F.Supp. 909, 917 (D. Mass. 1993). EchoCraft's song fits squarely within the statutory categories of criticism, comment, and teaching.

### 3. The "Reasonable Observer" Test Confirms Transformativeness

**Transformativeness turns on what a reasonable observer thinks, not the author's subjective intent.** *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 34; *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 216 (2d Cir. 2015) (asking what a "reasonable person" would perceive).

**A reasonable observer comparing the two songs would recognize EchoCraft's critique.** The observer would see:
- Identical opening lines establishing the baseline narrative
- New lines immediately qualifying that narrative ("though others helped raise that warning's light")
- Direct commentary on Riven's choices ("a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed")
- A final message about incomplete storytelling ("the ride we recall is brave, but incomplete")

**This structure signals criticism, not substitution.** The observer would understand that EchoCraft quotes Riven to question Riven's approach—precisely the kind of critical engagement that fair use exists to protect. See *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 580 (parody "must be able to 'conjure up' at least enough of [the original] to make the object of its critical wit recognizable").

### 4. EchoCraft's Song Serves a Different Educational Function

**Riven's song teaches through rote memorization.** The lyrics present a straightforward narrative: dates, events, names, locations. Exhibit G. This aids memorization, not critical thinking.

**EchoCraft's song teaches through critical discussion.** Columbia Grammar's principal testified that EchoCraft's song would "solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy" and that "there are educational benefits to asking questions about Paul Revere's legacy." Toobin Dep. at 86. This is a different pedagogical function.

**When the school chose EchoCraft's version, it chose critical discussion over rote memorization.** These are not substitutes in the same market. They are different educational tools serving different purposes. Cf. *Authors Guild*, 804 F.3d at 216 (finding transformative use where "Google's use of the copyrighted works serves a very different function" than the originals).

**Importantly, EchoCraft avoids the "remaster trap."** Courts have rejected fair use claims where the secondary work merely "remasters" the original—making it more accurate or better while serving the same purpose. See, e.g., *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 180 (2d Cir. 2024) (finding no fair use when defendant made books available for "lending" in the same manner as libraries). EchoCraft does not claim to teach history "better." It claims to question Riven's narrative choices. That is different.

### 5. Nonprofit Educational Distribution Favors Fair Use

**Factor 1 considers whether a use "is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). EchoCraft's song was released through EchoCraft Ed, the company's "not-for-profit education division." Raine Test. at 74.**

**EchoCraft charged schools $200 per license—below cost.** Raine testified that "the amount we charged was below the cost to us to produce and distribute it, so we did not make a profit." Id. at 76. The purpose was "generat[ing] significant good will," not revenue. Id. at 74.

**True, EchoCraft's parent company is a for-profit record label.** But incidental commercial benefit does not make a use non-transformative. In *Santos*, the Second Circuit found fair use even though Kimmel's podcast was commercial and profitable. 154 F.4th at 39. The court emphasized that "the more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors, including commercialism." *Id.* (quoting *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579). The same principle applies here. Strong transformativeness "may well excuse" any incidental commercialism. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

### 6. Factor 1 Weighs Decisively for EchoCraft

**Taken together, these considerations make Factor 1 the centerpiece of EchoCraft's fair use claim.** EchoCraft's song:
- Targets Riven's song for criticism, not history itself
- Uses a question mark and lyrical changes to signal interrogation
- Serves a different educational function (critical discussion vs. memorization)
- Was distributed through a nonprofit educational division at below cost

**Under *Santos*, "[t]he more transformative the secondary use, the less significant the other factors, including commercialism."** 154 F.4th at 39 (quoting *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579). EchoCraft's use is highly transformative. Factor 1 therefore weighs decisively in favor of fair use and "reduces the significance" of the remaining factors. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579.

### Outline Notes:

**Structure:**
1. **Introduction** - Factor 1 is "single most important"; Campbell transformativeness standard
2. **Target Analysis** - EchoCraft critiques Riven's song, not history; question mark signals shift
3. **Statutory Presumption** - In re DMCA, Rubin: strong presumption for statutory categories
4. **Reasonable Observer Test** - Santos standard; structural signals of criticism
5. **Different Educational Function** - Critical discussion vs. rote memorization; avoids remaster trap
6. **Nonprofit Distribution** - EchoCraft Ed, below-cost pricing; incidental benefit per Santos/Campbell
7. **Conclusion** - Factor 1 decisive; reduces significance of other factors

**Key Authority:**
- Santos v. Kimmel, 154 F.4th 30, 34, 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2025) - reasonable observer test, transformative reduces other factors
- Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 579-80 (1994) - transformativeness standard, conjure up doctrine
- Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508, 526 (2023) - distinguished (same purpose vs. different purpose)
- Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202, 216 (2d Cir. 2015) - different function test
- Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163, 180 (2d Cir. 2024) - remaster trap

**Record Facts:**
- Question mark in title (Exhibit H)
- "a line the storytellers favor, polished and mellowed" (Exhibit H)
- "He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish" (Exhibit H)
- Raine testimony: "celebrating Paul Revere...wrongheaded" (p. 75)
- Toobin testimony: "critical discussion about Revere's legacy" (p. 86)
- EchoCraft Ed not-for-profit, $200 below cost (Raine testimony, p. 74, 76)

**CRITICAL STRATEGIC POINTS:**
- NEVER say EchoCraft teaches history "better" — this is remaster trap
- Target is RIVEN'S SONG, not Paul Revere
- Schools preferring "critical discussion pedagogy" = different function, NOT substitution
