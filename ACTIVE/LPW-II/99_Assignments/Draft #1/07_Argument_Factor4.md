# FACTOR 4: MARKET EFFECT

**Draft #1 - EchoCraft (Appellee)**

---

## D. Factor 4: Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market

Factor 4 requires courts to consider "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work." 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). This is not merely a question of whether Riven lost a licensing opportunity. The question is whether EchoCraft's song "usurps the market for the original by offering a competing substitute." *Santos v. Kimmel*, 154 F.4th 30, 38 (2d Cir. 2025) (quoting *Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive*, 115 F.4th 163, 181 (2d Cir. 2024)). EchoCraft's song does not substitute for Riven's. It serves a different educational function. Factor 4 therefore favors fair use.

### 1. The Legal Framework: Substitution vs. Suppression

**The critical distinction is between substitution and critical suppression.** As the Second Circuit explained in *Hachette*, "we ask not whether the second work would damage the market for the first...but whether it usurps the market for the first by offering a competing substitute." 115 F.4th at 181 (emphasis in original). Fair use does not protect "competing substitutes," but it does protect "critical reviews or lampoons" that may incidentally suppress demand. *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 592 (1994).

**The Supreme Court in *Campbell* rejected the notion that every lost licensing opportunity equals market harm.** The Court emphasized that "copyright is not a tax on readership," and that fair use inherently involves some loss of royalty revenue. *Id.* at 591-92. What matters is whether the secondary use "occup[ies] the same market space as the original." *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 181.

### 2. Riven Had No Established Licensing Market

**Market effect analysis focuses on "traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets."** *Castle Rock Ent., Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Grp., Inc.*, 150 F.3d 132, 145 (2d Cir. 1998). Riven had no such market for his song.

**Riven's negotiations with Columbia Grammar were preliminary.** The record shows:
- Riven received a $500 "preliminary negotiation fee" from Principal Toobin
- Toobin emailed "Sounds good! We'll talk more soon" on January 14, 2024
- Toobin terminated negotiations on February 14, 2024—before EchoCraft even released its song
- No contract was ever drafted. Toobin Dep. at 84 ("Had anyone drafted that contract? No")

**This single preliminary discussion does not establish a market.** In *TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum*, the Second Circuit held that "regular" and "frequently" granted licensing requests are required to show a market. 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016). A single discussion, especially one that ended before any contract materialized, is insufficient.

**Riven's own conduct confirms the lack of market.** After Toobin terminated negotiations, Riven "tried reaching out" to other schools, but "no school was receptive." Riven Test. at 32. As of September 2024, "commercial interest in Riven's original composition has effectively vanished." Complaint ¶ 26. A "market" that consists of one failed preliminary negotiation is no market at all.

### 3. No Derivative Market for Criticism of One's Own Work

**Riven would never license a song criticizing his own work.** This is precisely what *Campbell* recognized when it held that "the unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the very notion of a potential licensing market." 510 U.S. at 592.

**EchoCraft's song falls squarely within this category.** It critiques Riven's "incomplete" storytelling, his "polished and mellowed" phrases, his historical inaccuracies. Exhibit H. Riven would never pay for the privilege of having his work criticized in this way. To treat this as a "lost market" is to rewrite copyright law as a guarantee against criticism.

**The Second Circuit confirmed this principle in *Santos*.** The court held that "creators do not typically license uses that are critical of or hostile to their own work." 154 F.4th at 40. Because no such licensing market exists, "criticisms will rarely cause cognizable market harm." *Id.* EchoCraft's song is criticism. It causes no cognizable market harm.

### 4. Columbia Grammar's Choice Reflects Different Educational Function

**Riven points to Columbia Grammar's decision as evidence of market substitution.** But this misunderstands what happened. Principal Toobin did not choose EchoCraft's song because it was "better." She chose it because it served a different pedagogical purpose.

**Toobin testified that EchoCraft's song would "solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy" and that "there are educational benefits to asking questions about Paul Revere's legacy."** Toobin Dep. at 86. This is not the same purpose as Riven's song, which aids rote memorization of historical facts.

**These are different educational functions.** A school might use both songs in sequence: first Riven's to establish the narrative, then EchoCraft's to critique it. Indeed, this is precisely how critical pedagogy works. Cf. *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 216 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding different function where Google's book search served research purposes, not reading).

**Importantly, EchoCraft does not claim its song is "more accurate" or "better history."** That framing would invite substitution analysis—treating EchoCraft's version as a "remaster" of Riven's. Courts have rejected fair use claims in such circumstances. See *Hachette*, 115 F.4th at 180 (Internet Archive made books available for "lending" in same manner as libraries). EchoCraft's song does not replace Riven's. It interrogates Riven's narrative choices. That is not substitution.

### 5. Factor 4 Favors Fair Use

**Taken together, these considerations show that Factor 4 favors fair use.** EchoCraft's song:
- Does not usurp the same market space as Riven's (*Hachette*)
- Operates in a market that Riven never established—only preliminary negotiations (*TCA Television*)
- Occupies a category of use (criticism of one's own work) that creators do not typically license (*Campbell*, *Santos*)
- Serves a different educational function (critical discussion vs. rote memorization)

**Riven's lost preliminary negotiation does not equal market harm.** Fair use "inherently involves some loss of royalty revenue." *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 591. What copyright does not protect is "the right to license criticism." *Santos*, 154 F.4th at 40. Factor 4 therefore weighs in favor of fair use.

### Outline Notes:

**Structure:**
1. **Legal Framework** - Substitution vs. suppression (Santos/Hachette); Campbell on tax on readership
2. **No Established Market** - Preliminary negotiations only; TCA Television on "regular and frequent" requirement; Riven's own efforts failed
3. **No Derivative Market for Criticism** - Campbell: creators won't license criticism of own work; Santos confirms
4. **Different Educational Function** - Toobin testimony: critical discussion vs. memorization; AVOIDS "more accurate" framing (remaster trap)
5. **Conclusion** - Factor 4 favors fair use; no right to license criticism

**Key Authority:**
- Santos v. Kimmel, 154 F.4th 30, 38, 40 (2d Cir. 2025) - substitution vs. suppression; no market for criticism
- Hachette Book Grp., Inc. v. Internet Archive, 115 F.4th 163, 180-81 (2d Cir. 2024) - same market space test; competing substitutes
- Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 591-92 (1994) - not a tax on readership; no derivative market for criticism
- TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum, 839 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2016) - regular and frequent required
- Castle Rock Ent., Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Grp., Inc., 150 F.3d 132, 145 (2d Cir. 1998) - traditional, reasonable, or likely-to-be-developed markets

**Record Facts:**
- Toobin "Sounds good" email (Exhibit I, p. 99)
- Toobin termination email Feb 14, 2024 (Exhibit I, p. 99)
- No contract drafted (Toobin Dep. at 84)
- $500 preliminary fee (Exhibit I, p. 101)
- "No school was receptive" (Riven Test. at 32)
- "Commercial interest...effectively vanished" (Complaint ¶ 26)
- "Solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy" (Toobin Dep. at 86)

**CRITICAL STRATEGIC POINTS:**
- NEVER say EchoCraft's song is "more accurate" — this is remaster trap
- Toobin chose "critical discussion pedagogy" — different function, NOT substitution
- Preliminary negotiations ≠ established market (TCA Television)
- No right to license criticism (Campbell, Santos)
