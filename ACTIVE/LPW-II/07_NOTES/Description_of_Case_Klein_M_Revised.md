## I. Cases/Rules/Statutes Involved

Philip Riven appeals from the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of EchoCraft Productions on two claims: (i) employment retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and (ii) copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 107.

**Retaliation Claim - Major Cases:**

1. *McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green*, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) - Establishes the burden-shifting framework for retaliation claims
2. *Littlejohn v. City of New York*, 795 F.3d 297, 315–16 (2d Cir. 2015) - Defines the prima facie elements: protected activity, employer knowledge, adverse action, and causation
3. *Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ.*, 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000) - Methods of establishing causation (temporal proximity, disparate treatment, retaliatory animus)
4. *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.*, 477 U.S. 242 (1986) - Summary judgment standard requiring viewing facts in light most favorable to non-movant

**Copyright Claim - Major Cases:**

1. *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569 (1994) - Transformation is central to fair use; transformative works reduce risk of effect on market
2. *Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.*, 471 U.S. 539 (1985) - Non-profit use and market harm analysis
3. *Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 348–51 (1991) - Creative works merit stronger copyright protection
4. *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 223 (2d Cir. 2015) - Market substitution test for fourth factor

The 17 U.S.C. § 107 fair use test requires courts to consider four factors: (1) purpose and character of use (including transformative nature); (2) nature of the copyrighted work; (3) amount and substantiality of portion used; and (4) effect on potential market.

## II. Defendant's Provisional Theory of the Case

EchoCraft Productions seeks affirmance of the district court's summary judgment on both claims. On the retaliation claim, EchoCraft contends that Riven failed to establish a prima facie case because he did not engage in protected activity under Title VII. His informal investigation into bonus disparities was exploratory rather than oppositional—he admitted uncertainty about whether gender discrimination existed, his supervisor understood the concern as departmental rather than discriminatory, and he never articulated a clear Title VII concern until months into his investigation. Moreover, EchoCraft lacked knowledge that the investigation concerned gender discrimination–at most, it was an investigation about the appearance of gender discrimination. Finally, Riven cannot establish causation: the seven-month gap between his August report and December termination undermines temporal proximity, and he cannot identify a similarly situated comparator who received more favorable treatment. His termination resulted from twelve consecutive months of failing to meet department quotas—legitimate, non-retaliatory performance failures.

On the copyright claim, EchoCraft argues that its song "Revere Paul Revere?" constitutes transformative fair use. The original celebrated Paul Revere uncritically as a memorization tool and contained historical inaccuracies. EchoCraft's version adds a question mark to signal critical inquiry, corrects factual errors, acknowledges historically marginalized figures, and provokes critical thinking about historical narratives—exactly the criticism and commentary that fair use protects. The four factors weigh in favor of fair use: the use is transformative and educational, produced by EchoCraft's non-profit unit; while the work is creative, transformation counterbalances this; the copying was necessary to identify inaccuracies being critiqued; and Riven had no established market that was harmed. Schools chose EchoCraft's version on educational merit, not as a knockoff substitute.

## III. Plaintiff's Anticipated Theory of the Case

Riven will likely argue that the district court erred by resolving disputed factual issues on summary judgment rather than submitting them to a jury. On retaliation, he will contend that Title VII protects employees who oppose gender-based pay discrimination, and that investigating suspected gender discrimination in bonus distribution qualifies as protected opposition activity without requiring formal certainty or investigative rigor; suspicion and preliminary evidence is sufficient to be protected. He will point to evidence of retaliatory animus, disparate treatment compared to similarly situated employees, and temporal proximity between his investigation and termination as creating genuine disputes of material fact that should be resolved by a jury.

On copyright, Riven will likely characterize EchoCraft's song as commercial misappropriation rather than transformative use. He will contend that copying the substantial majority of his lyrics verbatim cannot be justified as criticism or transformation, that EchoCraft's characterization as nonprofit is pretextual given commercial benefits to the parent company, and that his lost licensing opportunity constitutes direct evidence of market harm. He will argue that fair use does not permit copying another's work and then competing directly in the same market. That is amounts to exploitation that is in-line with his accusation of retaliation.

## IV. Preliminary Overview of Facts

**Employment and Retaliation**

Philip Riven worked at EchoCraft Productions from September 2018 through December 2023, rising to Manager of the country songwriting department in February 2020. In December 2022, employees at a holiday party expressed concern that departments with more women received lower bonuses than those with more men despite comparable performance. Between January and May 2023, Riven interviewed approximately 81 employees across 12 departments. In August 2023, he submitted a report finding that women received lower average bonuses than men in 9 of 12 departments.

CEO Ryan Raine became aware of Riven's investigation in May 2023 and sent an email calling Riven a virus infecting company culture. Shortly thereafter, three songwriters were transferred out of Riven's department. Throughout 2023, Riven's department failed to meet production quotas. After six consecutive months of missed quotas, he received a formal warning in July 2023. His department continued to miss quotas through December—twelve consecutive months total. Another manager, Jackie Moses, whose department also failed to meet quotas for six months, received no warning, though Moses had significantly more experience and her department met its quota by fourth quarter. Riven was terminated in December 2023, purportedly, for sustained unsatisfactory performance.

**Copyright Dispute**

In early December 2023, while still employed at EchoCraft, Riven composed an eight-line educational song titled "Revere Paul Revere" to help his daughter study for her AP U.S. History exam. The parties have stipulated that the song does not constitute a work for hire. He was terminated later that month on December 21, 2023. The song became popular at his daughter's school. In January 2024, Riven registered the copyright and began negotiating with school principal Elle Toobin about licensing the song. Toobin paid Riven a five-hundred dollar preliminary negotiation fee, though no prices were discussed and no contract was signed.

On January 15, 2024, EchoCraft released "Revere Paul Revere?" through its nonprofit educational division. EchoCraft's version retained seven of Riven's eight original lines verbatim and added seven new lines. It corrected one line regarding historical inaccuracies (Riven claimed Revere revealed no secrets when captured; historical records show otherwise) and added lines acknowledging other riders including William Dawes, Samuel Prescott, and Sybil Ludington. The title included a question mark to provoke critical inquiry. Shortly after EchoCraft's release, Toobin terminated negotiations with Riven and chose EchoCraft's version.

**Procedural History**

Riven filed suit alleging retaliation under Title VII and copyright infringement. EchoCraft moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion, concluding that Riven failed to establish a prima facie retaliation case and that EchoCraft's use constituted fair use as a matter of law. Riven now appeals to the Second Circuit.
