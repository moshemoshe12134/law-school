## I. CORE LEGAL QUESTIONS TO RESEARCH

### A. Factor 1: Transformative Use and Purpose

#### 1. Educational Correction as Transformative Use

**Core Question:** In the context of copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 1 (purpose and character of use), does correcting factual inaccuracies in an educational work constitute transformative use under the standards established in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music and Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith?

**Sub-questions:**

- Under the fair use transformativeness standard in the Second Circuit, what degree of transformation is required when both the original and secondary works serve educational markets?
- In copyright fair use Factor 1 analysis, does factual accuracy enhancement count as "new meaning, message, or expression" sufficient to establish transformativeness under Campbell?
- In fair use cases involving educational works, how do courts weigh pedagogical transformation (e.g., memorization tool → critical thinking prompt) when assessing whether a use is transformative?

#### 2. Commercial Benefit to Nonprofit Parent

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 1 (assessing whether use is commercial or nonprofit educational), when a nonprofit subsidiary releases educational materials that incidentally benefit the parent company's reputation/revenue, does this defeat the nonprofit educational characterization for Factor 1 purposes?

**Sub-questions:**

- In Second Circuit fair use jurisprudence, what is the test for determining "primary purpose" vs. "incidental benefits" when assessing the commercial nature of a use under Factor 1?
- In copyright fair use Factor 1 analysis, how do courts treat PR/reputational benefits that flow to parent companies from a nonprofit subsidiary's distribution of educational materials?
- Under fair use Factor 1's commerciality analysis, does licensing at or below cost through a nonprofit educational division insulate the use from being characterized as commercial?

#### 3. Scope of "Criticism" and "Teaching"

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis, does correcting historical inaccuracies in an educational work fall within the statutory categories of "criticism, comment, [or] teaching" enumerated in 17 U.S.C. § 107's preamble?

**Sub-questions:**

- Under copyright fair use doctrine, what constitutes "criticism" for purposes of 17 U.S.C. § 107—must it be meta-commentary about the original work, or can it be substantive correction of factual errors contained in the work?
- In fair use cases analyzing the statutory category of "teaching" under 17 U.S.C. § 107, how have courts defined this term beyond mere classroom distribution of materials?
- In copyright fair use Factor 1 analysis, can a work be characterized as both derivative (because it incorporates substantial portions of the original) AND critical/educational (because it corrects and comments on the original)?

#### 4. Post-Warhol Transformativeness Standard

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 1, how has the Supreme Court's decision in Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508 (2023), affected the transformativeness analysis in the Second Circuit, particularly for same-market uses?

**Sub-questions:**

- Under the fair use transformativeness standard post-Warhol, does the decision require a heightened showing of transformation when the defendant's work competes with the original in the same market?
- In fair use Factor 1 analysis post-Warhol, how does the Supreme Court's emphasis on "purpose and character" affect educational fair use claims in the Second Circuit?
- Has the Second Circuit issued any post-Warhol decisions (after May 2023) clarifying educational use standards under the fair use transformativeness analysis?
- How does Warhol's "purpose and character" focus affect educational fair use claims?
- Has Second Circuit issued post-Warhol decisions clarifying educational use standards?

---

### B. Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality

#### 5. Reasonable Copying for Critical Purpose

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 3 (amount and substantiality of portion used), is 87.5% verbatim copying (7 of 8 lines) reasonable when the purpose is to criticize and correct factual inaccuracies in those specific lines?

**Sub-questions:**

- Under fair use Factor 3 in the Second Circuit, what percentage of verbatim copying has been approved for purposes of educational criticism or commentary?
- In fair use Factor 3 analysis, does Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music's "conjure up" standard (permitting copying necessary to identify what is being parodied) apply outside the parody context to criticism and commentary?
- In copyright fair use cases analyzing amount and substantiality under Factor 3, how do courts distinguish between necessary copying for effective criticism versus excessive copying that exceeds what is needed?
- Does Campbell's "conjure up" standard apply outside parody context?
- How do courts distinguish necessary copying from excessive copying for criticism?

#### 6. Factual vs. Creative Content in Copied Lines

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 3 (amount and substantiality), when analyzing "substantiality" of the portion used, do courts differentiate between copying factual content (dates, names, historical events) versus creative expression (original phrasing, metaphors, artistic choices)?

**Sub-questions:**

- Under copyright law's idea/expression dichotomy and fair use Factor 3 analysis, are famous historical phrases like "one if by land, two if by sea" considered protectable creative expression or unprotectable factual content?
- In fair use Factor 3's substantiality analysis, how do courts weigh the copying of factual recitation versus the copying of creative arrangement when assessing the qualitative significance of what was taken?
- In copyright fair use cases involving educational works, does the educational context affect the substantiality analysis of factual copying under Factor 3?
- How do courts weigh copying of factual recitation vs. creative arrangement?
- Does educational context affect substantiality analysis of factual copying?

---

### C. Factor 4: Market Harm

#### 7. Definition of "Potential Market"

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 4 (effect on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work), what constitutes a "potential market" for Factor 4 purposes—do preliminary negotiations without signed contracts, agreed prices, or finalized budgets suffice to establish a cognizable market?

**Sub-questions:**

- Under fair use Factor 4's "potential market" analysis, how concrete must future commercial opportunities be to constitute a cognizable "potential market" deserving protection?
- In copyright fair use cases analyzing market harm under Factor 4, what evidence distinguishes "speculative" markets (not protected) from "potential" markets (protected)?
- Under fair use Factor 4 market harm analysis, does the loss of a single preliminary negotiation (with no signed contract or agreed-upon terms) establish sufficient market harm to weigh against fair use?
- What evidence distinguishes "speculative" from "potential" markets?
- Does loss of single preliminary negotiation establish market harm?

#### 8. Market Substitution vs. Market Superiority

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 4 (market harm), when a transformative work is chosen over the original work because it is educationally or qualitatively superior (more accurate, more complete, more useful), does this constitute actionable market harm under Factor 4 or legitimate competition protected by fair use?

**Sub-questions:**

- Under copyright fair use doctrine, does Factor 4 permit transformative works to compete with original works in the same market, or does same-market competition inherently constitute market harm that weighs against fair use?
- In fair use Factor 4's causation analysis, how do courts determine whether market loss was caused by impermissible substitution versus caused by consumers preferring the transformative work's superior qualities?
- In copyright fair use market harm analysis under Factor 4, what role does consumer choice based on quality/accuracy play—if a customer chooses the transformative work because it is more accurate, does this constitute market harm?
- How do courts analyze causation—was market loss due to substitution or due to superiority?
- What role does consumer choice (Toobin preferring accuracy) play in market analysis?

#### 9. Licensing Market vs. Direct Distribution Market

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 Factor 4 (market harm), when determining the "relevant market" for purposes of assessing market harm, is the relevant market (a) the plaintiff's potential licensing market, or (b) the educational materials market generally?

**Sub-questions:**

- Under fair use Factor 4 in educational copyright cases, how do courts define "the market" for purposes of analyzing potential market harm—is it the specific licensing market, the broader educational market, or both?
- In copyright fair use Factor 4 analysis, does a transformative use create a different market segment such that there is no overlap with the original work's market?
- Under fair use Factor 4's market harm analysis, can a defendant's use be found to harm a licensing market if no established licensing market existed at the time of the alleged infringement?
- Does transformative use create different market segment?
- Can defendant's use harm licensing market if no established licensing market existed?

---

### D. Summary Judgment Standards

#### 10. Disputed Facts vs. Disputed Law

**Core Question:** In copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107, which aspects of the four-factor fair use analysis are questions of law (appropriate for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56) versus questions of fact (requiring jury resolution)?

**Sub-questions:**

- In copyright fair use cases in the Second Circuit, when is transformativeness under Factor 1 a factual question requiring jury resolution, and when can it be decided as a matter of law on summary judgment?
- Under federal summary judgment standards (Fed. R. Civ. P. 56), can a district court grant summary judgment on copyright fair use when the parties dispute market impact under Factor 4, or does this factual dispute preclude summary judgment?
- On appeal to the Second Circuit from a district court's fair use determination under 17 U.S.C. § 107, what standard of review and deference is owed to the district court's fair use analysis—de novo review, clearly erroneous, or abuse of discretion?
- Can court grant summary judgment on fair use when parties dispute market impact?
- What deference is owed to district court's fair use determination on appeal?

**Westlaw AI Query:** After the Supreme Court's decision in Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith (2023), has the Second Circuit applied or clarified the transformativeness standard for nonprofit educational uses under copyright fair use Factor 1, and has Warhol's emphasis on "purpose and character" narrowed educational fair use protection?

---

### PROMPT SET B: Factor 3 - Amount and Substantiality

#### Prompt B1: High-Percentage Educational Copying

**Westlaw AI Query:** Under copyright fair use Factor 3 (amount and substantiality), when a defendant copies 70% or more of a copyrighted work for educational criticism or commentary purposes, what justifications have courts accepted for such high-percentage copying, and is this amount of copying considered reasonable under the fair use analysis?

**Westlaw AI Query:** In copyright fair use Factor 3's substantiality analysis, when a defendant copies material that contains both factual content (historical dates, names, events) and creative expression (original phrasing, arrangement), how do courts distinguish between protectable creative expression and unprotectable facts when assessing what was taken?

---

#### Prompt B3: Conjuring vs. Excess Copying

**Westlaw AI Query:** Under copyright fair use Factor 3, does Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music's "conjure up" principle—permitting copying of enough material to identify the work being parodied—extend to educational criticism and commentary beyond parody, and if so, how much copying is permitted to effectively identify and criticize the original work?

---

### PROMPT SET C: Factor 4 - Market Harm

#### Prompt C1: Preliminary Negotiations as Market

**Westlaw AI Query:** In copyright fair use Factor 4's "potential market" analysis, do preliminary negotiations without a signed contract, agreed-upon price, or finalized budget constitute a cognizable "potential market," and what level of concreteness is required for commercial opportunities to qualify as a protected market under 17 U.S.C. § 107?

---

#### Prompt C2: Superiority vs. Substitution

**Westlaw AI Query:** Under copyright fair use Factor 4, when a transformative educational work competes with the original work in the same market but is chosen by consumers because it is more accurate or educationally superior, does this constitute actionable market harm or legitimate competition that is protected by fair use?

---

#### Prompt C3: Causation in Market Loss

**Westlaw AI Query:** In copyright fair use Factor 4 analysis, when a copyright plaintiff loses sales or licensing opportunities after the defendant releases a transformative work, how do courts analyze causation to determine whether the market harm was caused by impermissible substitution or by consumers legitimately preferring the transformative work's superior qualities?

---

#### Prompt C4: Licensing Markets Definition

**Westlaw AI Query:** Under copyright fair use Factor 4 in the Second Circuit, does a "potential market" for licensing exist if the plaintiff copyright holder had no established history of licensing the work, and must the licensing market be "traditional" or "reasonably developed" to merit protection from fair use?

**Westlaw AI Query:** In the Second Circuit, which aspects of copyright fair use analysis under 17 U.S.C. § 107 are questions of law appropriate for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and which aspects are questions of fact requiring jury resolution, particularly regarding transformativeness under Factor 1 and market harm under Factor 4?

---

#### Prompt D2: Disputed Market Impact at Summary Judgment

**Westlaw AI Query:** Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, when parties in a copyright case present competing evidence about market harm under fair use Factor 4, does this factual dispute preclude summary judgment on the fair use defense, or can a district court resolve market harm questions as a matter of law on summary judgment?

---

### PROMPT SET E: Special Issues

#### Prompt E1: Educational Songs/Music Fair Use

**Westlaw AI Query:** Under copyright fair use analysis, are there special considerations or different standards when applying the four factors of 17 U.S.C. § 107 to musical works (songs, lyrics) used for educational or teaching purposes compared to other types of copyrighted works?

---

#### Prompt E2: Same-Market Transformative Uses Post-Warhol

**Westlaw AI Query:** After Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith (2023), when a transformative work serves the same market or purpose as the original copyrighted work, has the Supreme Court created a presumption against fair use for same-market uses, or can strong transformation under Factor 1 still overcome market overlap under Factor 4?

---

#### Prompt E3: Historical Accuracy as Public Interest

**Westlaw AI Query:** In copyright fair use analysis, do courts consider the public interest in historically accurate educational information when analyzing the four factors of 17 U.S.C. § 107, and does correcting historical inaccuracies weigh in favor of finding fair use?

## IV. KEY FACTS TO INTEGRATE

**When finding cases, constantly ask: "How do our facts compare?"**

### Our Strongest Facts:

- ✓ Released through nonprofit educational division
- ✓ Licensed at/below cost (no profit on song itself)
- ✓ Added 7 new lines (50% new content)
- ✓ Corrected factual inaccuracies (revealed secrets line)
- ✓ Changed pedagogical purpose (memorization → critical thinking)
- ✓ Added question mark (signaling critical inquiry)
- ✓ Acknowledged historically marginalized figures (Ludington, Prescott, Dawes)
- ✓ Toobin admitted EchoCraft version "solicits critical discussion" original doesn't
- ✓ No signed contract with Toobin—only preliminary negotiations
- ✓ No agreed price, no finalized budget
- ✓ Only one potential customer (Toobin); no other schools interested

### Our Weakest Facts:

- ✗ Copied 7 of 8 lines (87.5%) verbatim
- ✗ Parent company revenue improved after release (-5% → +2%)
- ✗ Generated positive press for parent company
- ✗ Toobin terminated negotiations and chose EchoCraft version
- ✗ Riven received $500 preliminary fee
- ✗ Both works serve same educational market (AP U.S. History students)
- ✗ Schools directly chose between the two works

### Disputed Facts (Legal Characterization):

- **Transformativeness:** We say critical/educational transformation; they say minimal addition
- **Commercial Nature:** We say nonprofit educational; they say PR scheme for commercial parent
- **Market Harm:** We say no established market + superiority; they say direct substitution + lost deal
- **Necessity of Copying:** We say necessary for criticism; they say excessive/could write new song

## V. ARGUMENT STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT

**Use research to build these argument components:**

### A. Opening Framework

1. Fair use protects transformative criticism and educational commentary (Campbell)
2. This case presents paradigmatic fair use: correcting educational inaccuracies
3. All four factors, viewed holistically, support fair use

### B. Factor 1 (STRONGEST)

1. Song is transformative—changes purpose from celebration to critical inquiry
2. Corrects factual inaccuracies (necessary educational purpose)
3. Adds new meaning (question Revere's legacy, acknowledge others)
4. Released through nonprofit educational division at/below cost
5. Falls within statutory "criticism, comment, teaching" categories
6. Incidental PR benefit doesn't negate primary educational purpose

### C. Factor 2 (CONCEDE BUT MINIMIZE)

1. Riven's work is creative, so Factor 2 favors him
2. But Campbell says Factor 2 "not likely to help much" with creative works
3. Work primarily informational/educational, reducing protection
4. Factor 2's weight diminished by strong transformativeness

### D. Factor 3 (DEFEND AS REASONABLE)

1. While percentage high (87.5%), copying was reasonable for critical purpose
2. Needed to establish traditional narrative before questioning it
3. Much copied content is factual (dates, names, events)—less protection
4. Added 50% new content (7 new lines) that transforms message
5. Campbell permits copying "heart" when purpose is criticism

### E. Factor 4 (ATTACK "POTENTIAL MARKET" CLAIM)

1. No established market—only preliminary negotiation with one party
2. No contract, no price, no budget, no agreement
3. Toobin chose EchoCraft because it's educationally superior, not because it's substitute
4. Fair use permits better transformative works to compete with originals
5. Causation: loss due to superiority, not substitution
6. Plaintiff cannot claim harm to market that never materialized

### F. Holistic Analysis

1. Factors don't mechanically balance—transformation dominates
2. Purpose of fair use: promote knowledge, education, accurate information
3. Denying fair use would harm public interest in educational accuracy
4. Summary judgment appropriate—no genuine factual disputes

---

## VI. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS TO ANTICIPATE

**Research must also address Riven's likely arguments:**

### Riven's Argument 1: "Minimal Transformation"

**Their claim:** Simply adding question mark and few lines isn't transformative

**Our response:** Find cases where relatively modest additions held transformative when they changed fundamental purpose/message

**Research needed:** Transformative use cases with <50% new content that were still protected

---

### Riven's Argument 2: "Commercial Exploitation"

**Their claim:** EchoCraft used song to boost company image/revenue; nonprofit is sham

**Our response:** Find cases distinguishing primary purpose from incidental benefits

**Research needed:** Cases where commercial benefits didn't defeat nonprofit/educational characterization

---

### Riven's Argument 3: "Excessive Copying"

**Their claim:** 87.5% copying is per se unreasonable; could have written new song

**Our response:** Find cases approving high-percentage copying when necessary for criticism/comment

**Research needed:** Educational fair use cases with >70% copying that were approved

---

### Riven's Argument 4: "Direct Market Substitution"

**Their claim:** Toobin literally chose EchoCraft instead of licensing Riven's song—clear market harm

**Our response:** Find cases holding that transformative work can compete in same market; loss due to superiority not substitution

**Research needed:** Market harm cases where defendant's work was superior/better and court still found fair use

---

### Riven's Argument 5: "Genuine Factual Disputes Preclude Summary Judgment"

**Their claim:** Whether use is transformative, whether market harm exists = factual questions for jury

**Our response:** Find Second Circuit cases granting summary judgment on fair use despite disputed facts

**Research needed:** Standards for when fair use is question of law vs. fact

---

2. **What is Second Circuit's post-Warhol standard for transformativeness?**

   - Has standard changed? What language should we use?
3. **What percentage copying has Second Circuit approved, and under what circumstances?**

   - Need to contextualize our 87.5% figure
4. **What evidence of market harm is required for Factor 4?**

   - Define threshold for "potential market" vs. "speculative opportunity"
5. **Can court grant summary judgment when parties dispute market impact?**

   - Standards for resolving factual disputes on fair use
6. **What is the hierarchy among the four factors post-Warhol?**

   - Does Factor 1 still dominate, or did Warhol elevate Factor 4?

## NOTES & STRATEGIC REMINDERS

**Remember:**

- You represent **EchoCraft** (appellee/defendant)
- Burden on appeal is on **Riven** (appellant) to show district court erred
- Standard: abuse of discretion / de novo review (clarify which standard applies)
- Focus: Fair use only (Issue 2); not writing on retaliation claim (Issue 1)
- Goal: Affirm summary judgment on fair use defense
- Theme: Educational criticism that improves public discourse = core fair use
- Weakest point: Market harm (Toobin deal) — need strong research here
- Strongest point: Transformative educational purpose — lean into this

**Writing Tips:**

- Lead with strongest authority (Second Circuit, recent, on-point)
- Distinguish unhelpful cases with facts, not dismissive language
- Use Toobin's testimony about "critical discussion" extensively
- Emphasize public interest in historically accurate education
- Frame as: original contained errors → EchoCraft corrected → public benefits
