# Riven v. EchoCraft Productions: Case Description

**Representing:** EchoCraft Productions (Defendant-Appellee)

**Procedural Posture:** Appeal from district court's grant of summary judgment on Title VII retaliation claim. District court found Riven failed to establish prima facie case.

**Question Presented:** Did the district court err in finding that no reasonable jury could conclude Riven established a prima facie case of retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a)?

---

## I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### Employment History

Philip Riven worked at EchoCraft from September 2018 to December 2023. He was promoted to Manager of the country songwriting department in February 2020—unusually fast after only 18 months. His department exceeded quotas in 2021-2022, and he received "Exceeding Expectations" reviews calling him a "powerhouse."

In 2023, Riven's department failed to meet quotas for twelve consecutive months, producing under 20 songs per quarter (below the 25/quarter expectation). In July 2023, Sniff issued Riven a formal warning. In December 2023, EchoCraft terminated Riven for "unsatisfactory performance and consistent failure to meet quotas."

### The Investigation

In December 2022, seven employees discussed bonuses at a holiday party. Employees from Jackie Moses's department (mostly women: 12 women, 3 men) expressed concern about receiving lower bonuses than Riven's department (10 men, 5 women) despite comparable performance reviews. One employee suggested gender discrimination. Riven said he would "look into it."

On January 10, 2023, Riven met with supervisor Daphne Sniff. Sniff testified the concern was presented as "a departmental issue, not a gender one." Riven testified he "wasn't certain it was gender based" but mentioned Moses's department "having a solid number of women" and that he "certainly felt that might be the cause." Sniff told Riven she didn't believe discrimination occurred but he was "free to poke around."

Between January and May 2023, Riven interviewed approximately 81 employees across 12 departments about bonuses. On August 18, 2023, Riven submitted a report finding that in 9 of 12 departments, women received lower average bonuses than men. Sniff responded: "I take these concerns very seriously. However, are you sure this is the best use of your time right now?"

### Employer Response

In May 2023, CEO Ryan Raine sent an email to Sniff after hearing about Riven's investigation. Raine called Riven "a virus infecting the company culture" with a "vendetta against the firm" and instructed Sniff to "keep your subordinates in line." However, Raine testified he heard the investigation concerned bonus shortages and "some mention of Riven particularly focusing on departments with a lot of women, but that didn't mean much to me at the time."

In late June/early July 2023, three songwriters were transferred from Riven's department to the Pop department. In July 2023, Sniff issued Riven a formal warning for failing to meet quotas for six months. 

Jackie Moses—another manager whose department also failed to meet quotas for six months—received no warning. However, Moses had 20+ years more experience, 12+ years longer as manager, a proven track record of recovery from performance dips, and her department met its quota in Q4 2023. Moses declined to participate in Riven's investigation.

## II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### Prima Facie Case Elements (Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 315-16 (2d Cir. 2015))

To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, plaintiff must prove:

1. He participated in a **protected activity**
2. Defendant had **knowledge** of the protected activity  
3. Defendant took a **materially adverse action** (stipulated here)
4. There was a **causal connection** between the protected activity and adverse action

### Protected Activity (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a))

The statute protects employees discriminated against "because he has **opposed** any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this title" (**Opposition Clause**) or "because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or **participated** in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing **under this title**" (**Participation Clause**).

---

## III. THE CORE DISPUTE

**At its core, this case presents a question of statutory interpretation: Does Title VII intend to protect informal, self-directed employee investigations conducted without clear articulation of Title VII concerns?**

### Riven's Position

Riven will argue his conduct constitutes protected activity from the moment he began investigating in January 2023. He will characterize:
- The January 10 meeting as opposing discriminatory bonus practices
- His four-month investigation as protected opposition to Title VII violations
- His August report as formal documentation of illegal discrimination
- His termination as retaliation for challenging discrimination

Riven will argue EchoCraft's performance-based justifications are pretextual. He will point to the temporal proximity between his investigation and adverse actions (warning, termination), the "virus" email showing animus, and disparate treatment compared to Moses.

### EchoCraft's Position  

**EchoCraft's core theory: Riven wasted months on an informal, non-rigorous "wild goose chase" instead of managing his underperforming department. He was terminated for legitimate poor performance. Title VII does not protect employees who pursue personal vendettas under the guise of discrimination concerns while failing to do their jobs.**

The statute protects employees who **oppose** known discrimination or **participate** in formal EEOC processes—not employees who conduct ambiguous personal investigations. Riven's conduct does not meet the legal standards for protected activity, and even if it did, no causal connection exists given the legitimate performance reasons and material differences from the Moses comparator.

---

## IV. ECHOCRAFT'S ARGUMENTS ON EACH ELEMENT

### A. Protected Activity: Riven's Conduct Does Not Meet Statutory Requirements

#### 1. Opposition Clause: No "Opposition" to Title VII Practice

**The weak point:** Riven never clearly opposed a Title VII violation. He conducted an ambiguous investigation to determine WHETHER discrimination existed.

**Key facts:**
- January 10: Riven admitted he "wasn't certain it was gender based" (Record p.23)
- January 10: Sniff understood concern as "departmental issue, not gender one" (Record p.44)
- January-May: Investigation framed ambiguously throughout
- August 18: First clear articulation of gender discrimination claim—7 months after investigation began

**Legal argument:** "Opposition" requires affirmative challenge to a practice the employee reasonably believes violates Title VII. Riven's conduct was investigatory, not adversarial. He never filed a complaint, never clearly stated he believed EchoCraft was violating Title VII, and framed his concerns ambiguously when speaking to supervisors.

**Standard to establish:** Second Circuit precedent defining the threshold conduct for "opposition"—specifically, whether informal investigation where employee admits uncertainty constitutes protected "opposition."

**Connection to facts:** Even accepting Riven's testimony that gender was "on his mind," he never communicated opposition to a Title VII violation. An employee who is uncertain whether discrimination exists, who frames concerns as "departmental," and who merely "pokes around" has not opposed an unlawful employment practice.

#### 2. Reasonable Belief: Suspicion Is Not Enough

**The weak point:** Riven admitted skepticism and uncertainty—this does not constitute "reasonable belief" that Title VII violation was occurring.

**Key facts:**
- Holiday party: Riven was "skeptical" about gender theory (Record p.22)
- January 10: "I wasn't certain it was gender based" (Record p.23)
- Investigation sought to determine IF discrimination existed—not to challenge known discrimination

**Legal argument:** The reasonable belief standard requires the employee believe a Title VII violation is occurring—not merely suspect something might be wrong. Finding statistical disparities in bonuses does not equal believing intentional gender discrimination is occurring.

**Standard to establish:** Second Circuit cases on what level of certainty/belief required. Suspicion, curiosity, or desire to investigate whether discrimination exists should not suffice.

**Connection to facts:** Riven conducted an investigation because he didn't know if discrimination existed. This investigatory mindset—admitting skepticism and uncertainty—does not meet the "reasonable belief" standard.

#### 3. Communication: Ambiguous Framing Defeats Opposition

**The weak point:** Riven never clearly communicated that he believed Title VII violation was occurring.

**Key facts:**
- January 10: Sniff testified concern was "departmental issue, not gender one" (Record p.44)
- Riven mentioned "women in Jackie's department" but in context of department comparisons
- Sniff's reasonable interpretation: investigating departmental bonus differences
- August 18: First clear Title VII claim

**Legal argument:** Opposition requires communication clear enough to put the employer on notice that employee believes Title VII violation is occurring. When employee frames concerns ambiguously, employer's reasonable interpretation controls.

**Standard to establish:** Second Circuit cases on communication requirements—how explicitly must employee articulate Title VII concern for conduct to qualify as "opposition."

**Connection to facts:** Sniff reasonably interpreted the January meeting as a departmental concern. Riven's ambiguous framing meant EchoCraft had no notice of alleged Title VII opposition.

#### 4. Participation Clause: No EEOC Involvement

**The weak point:** "Participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing **under this title**" requires formal EEOC process.

**Key facts:**
- Riven never filed EEOC charge
- No EEOC investigation occurred
- Self-directed internal investigation only

**Legal argument:** "Under this title" means under Title VII's enforcement mechanisms. The participation clause protects employees engaging with formal EEOC processes, not personal investigations. If any investigation qualified as "participation," the statutory distinction between opposition and participation would be meaningless.

**Standard to establish:** Second Circuit interpretation of "under this title"—whether it requires EEOC involvement or can include internal investigations.

**Connection to facts:** Riven's personal investigation was not "under" Title VII. It was a private inquiry with no connection to Title VII's enforcement apparatus.

---

### B. Knowledge: EchoCraft Did Not Know About Title VII Claim

**The weak point:** EchoCraft did not know Riven believed a Title VII violation was occurring until August 2023 at earliest.

**Key facts:**
- January 10: Sniff understood "departmental issue, not gender one" (Record p.44)
- May 24: Raine heard about "vendetta" and "women" but it "didn't mean much to me" (Record p.68-69)
- August 18: First clear Title VII claim

**Legal argument:** Knowledge requires employer knew employee believed Title VII violation was occurring. Ambiguous communication does not provide notice. Sniff's reasonable interpretation controlled—she understood departmental concern. Raine heard vague reference to "women" but didn't understand Title VII claim.

**Standard to establish:** Second Circuit cases on specificity of knowledge required—must employer know specifically about Title VII claim, or is knowledge of general complaint sufficient?

**Connection to facts:** EchoCraft cannot have knowledge of Title VII "opposition" when employee never clearly articulated Title VII concern. First clear Title VII claim came in August—seven months before termination, which undermines temporal proximity for causation.

---

### C. Causation: No Causal Connection Established

Even if protected activity and knowledge established (they are not), Riven cannot show causal connection.

#### 1. Temporal Proximity: Seven Months Too Long

**The weak point:** Seven months between report (Aug 18) and termination (Dec 21) too long for temporal proximity inference.

**Key facts:**
- 11 months between investigation start and termination
- 7 months between report and termination  
- 3-4 months between report and termination decision
- Termination occurred during regular year-end personnel review cycle

**Legal argument:** Seven months insufficient for temporal proximity inference of causation. Intervening legitimate business cycle (year-end review) breaks causal chain.

**Standard to establish:** Second Circuit cases on timeframes for "close" temporal proximity.

**Connection to facts:** Long time gap between any "protected activity" and termination, combined with ongoing legitimate performance concerns throughout period, negates causation inference.

#### 2. Disparate Treatment: Moses Not Valid Comparator

**The weak point:** Moses not "similarly situated in all material respects."

**Key facts comparison:**

| Factor | Riven | Moses |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Hire date | 2018 | 2000 (20 years earlier) |
| Manager since | 2020 | 2008 (12 years longer) |
| Track record | 3 years (2 good, 1 bad) | 15+ years; history of recovery |
| Department founder | No | Yes ("I'm an institution") |
| Q4 2023 recovery | No | Yes—met quota |

**Legal argument:** "Similarly situated" requires comparable in all material respects. Moses's 20+ years additional experience, 12+ years longer as manager, proven track record of recovery, and actual Q4 recovery are material differences justifying different treatment.

**Standard to establish:** Second Circuit cases defining "similarly situated"—how much difference in experience/tenure/track record disqualifies comparator?

**Connection to facts:** Sniff's different treatment of Moses was based on legitimate factors—experience, proven ability to recover, institutional knowledge. Riven cannot establish causation when his comparator is materially different in ways that explain the disparate treatment.

#### 3. Retaliatory Animus: Legitimate Frustration, Not Retaliation

**The weak point:** Evidence shows frustration with poor performance and productivity disruption—not animus toward Title VII activity.

**Key facts:**
- Raine email: frustrated by "vendetta" disrupting productivity—didn't know about Title VII claim
- Sniff response: concerned about time management ("best use of your time")
- All termination communications cite only performance reasons
- Sniff frustrated by poor performance: "getting on my nerves... failed to meet quotas"

**Legal argument:** No animus toward Title VII activity. Raine didn't know investigation concerned Title VII. Sniff was concerned about time management and performance. Frustration with underperforming employee conducting productivity-disrupting investigation ≠ retaliatory animus toward protected activity.

**Standard to establish:** Second Circuit cases distinguishing legitimate frustration from retaliatory animus—must animus be directed at Title VII activity specifically?

**Connection to facts:** All employer frustration directed at (1) poor performance, and (2) productivity disruption from investigation. No evidence of animus toward opposing discrimination specifically.

---

## V. THE STATUTORY INTERPRETATION QUESTION

**The fundamental issue: What conduct does Title VII intend to protect?**

### Riven's Interpretation

Title VII protects any employee who investigates potential discrimination, even informally, to encourage employees to root out discrimination without fear of retaliation.

**Policy argument:** Requiring formal complaints or EEOC charges would chill employees from investigating discrimination. Informal investigations serve important function in identifying discrimination.

### EchoCraft's Interpretation

**Title VII protects employees who (1) affirmatively oppose known discrimination with reasonable belief a violation is occurring, or (2) participate in formal EEOC enforcement processes. It does not protect employees who conduct ambiguous personal investigations while neglecting job duties.**

**Policy argument:** Riven's interpretation would allow any underperforming employee to insulate themselves from termination by launching an informal investigation. This would:
- Create perverse incentive for failing employees
- Protect vendettas and personal agendas under Title VII's umbrella
- Require employers to retain poor performers indefinitely  
- Frustrate legitimate performance-based employment decisions

**The law should not protect:**
- Investigations conducted with admitted skepticism/uncertainty
- Ambiguously-framed concerns that don't put employer on notice
- Self-directed personal inquiries unconnected to EEOC process
- Employees who prioritize investigation over job duties

**The statute draws lines:** "Opposition" requires affirmative challenge. "Participation" requires engagement with Title VII enforcement apparatus. Riven's conduct meets neither standard.

---

## VI. SUMMARY OF ECHOCRAFT'S POSITION

**Philip Riven failed to perform his job. His department missed quotas for twelve consecutive months. Rather than focus on managing his team, he spent months conducting an informal investigation that he admits he was "skeptical" about, that he "wasn't certain" involved gender discrimination, and that his supervisor reasonably understood as a departmental inquiry.**

**When EchoCraft terminated Riven for legitimate poor performance—during its regular year-end review cycle, seven months after any "protected activity"—Riven claimed retaliation. But the law does not protect employees who:**
- Conduct ambiguous personal investigations without clear opposition to Title VII violations
- Admit uncertainty about whether discrimination exists
- Frame concerns so ambiguously that employers reasonably interpret them differently  
- Use "investigation" as excuse for poor performance

**Even viewing all facts in Riven's favor, no reasonable jury could find he established a prima facie case. The district court correctly granted summary judgment.**

---

## VII. OUTSTANDING RESEARCH NEEDS

To fully develop these arguments, Second Circuit precedent needed on:

1. **Opposition threshold:** Minimum conduct qualifying as "opposition" (formal vs. informal)
2. **Reasonable belief standard:** Certainty level required (suspicion vs. belief)
3. **Communication requirements:** Clarity needed to put employer on notice
4. **Participation clause scope:** Whether "under this title" requires EEOC involvement
5. **Knowledge specificity:** Whether employer must know specifically about Title VII nature
6. **Temporal proximity:** Timeframe for "close" proximity (7 months)
7. **Similarly situated standard:** Material respects for comparator (experience/tenure)
8. **Retaliatory animus:** Must animus be toward Title VII activity specifically

---

## VIII. CONCLUSION

This case is not about whether discrimination in bonus awards is wrong—it is about what statutory protections exist for employees investigating potential discrimination. The district court correctly held that Title VII does not protect informal, ambiguously-framed personal investigations conducted by employees admitting uncertainty while failing to perform their jobs. 

The question for this Court is whether the law intends to cover an instance such as this. We respectfully submit it does not.
