# Description of the Case

## I. Cases/Rules/Statutes Involved

This appeal stems from the district court's grant of summary judgment on two claims: (i) employment retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and (ii) copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 107.

### Retaliation Claim

**Summary Judgment Standard**
The district court applied *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby*, 477 U.S. 242 (1986), which requires viewing facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant.

**Prima Facie Framework**
The district court relied on *Littlejohn v. City of New York*, 795 F.3d 297, 315-16 (2015), which establishes that a plaintiff must prove: (1) participation in protected activity; (2) employer knowledge of that activity; (3) an adverse action; and (4) a causal connection. The court also cited *McDonnell Douglas*, 411 U.S. at 802-04, for the burden-shifting framework.

**Causation**
The district court cited *Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ.*, 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000), which permits showing causation through temporal proximity, disparate treatment, or retaliatory animus.

**Our Legal Theory**: The district court misapplied these standards by resolving disputed factual issues—particularly regarding Riven's intent, EchoCraft's knowledge, and causation—that should have gone to a jury. The court improperly credited EchoCraft's version of ambiguous facts rather than drawing all inferences in Riven's favor as *Anderson* requires.

### Copyright Claim

**Fair Use Test**
The district court applied 17 U.S.C. § 107's four-factor test, relying heavily on *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579, which holds that transformative use is the central inquiry under factor one.

**Key Cases Applied by District Court**:
- *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579 (transformative use analysis)
- *Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.*, 471 U.S. 539 (1985) (non-profit nature and market harm)
- *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 348–51 (1991) (creative works merit stronger protection)
- *Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 223 (2d Cir. 2015) (market substitution analysis)

**Our Legal Theory**: The district court misapplied *Campbell* by finding transformation where EchoCraft merely duplicated Riven's work with minor modifications. The court also ignored material factual disputes regarding market harm, which *Harper & Row* instructs should be resolved by a jury, not on summary judgment. The district court improperly weighed competing evidence rather than determining whether genuine disputes exist.

## II. Defendant's Provisional Theory of the Case

EchoCraft Productions is the appellee and prevailing party below. EchoCraft maintains that the district court properly granted summary judgment on both claims because no reasonable jury could find in Riven's favor, even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to him.

### Retaliation

On the retaliation claim, EchoCraft contends that Riven cannot satisfy his prima facie burden. First, EchoCraft argues that Riven did not engage in protected activity within Title VII's meaning. His internal inquiry into bonus disparities, conducted at management's invitation, did not constitute opposition to an unlawful employment practice because he never communicated a reasonable belief that EchoCraft was violating Title VII by discriminating based on a protected characteristic. Second, EchoCraft asserts it lacked knowledge that Riven's investigation concerned gender discrimination, which is fatal to a retaliation claim. Third, EchoCraft maintains that Riven cannot establish the requisite causal connection between any protected activity and his termination, which was based on documented performance deficiencies—specifically, six consecutive months of failing to meet songwriting quotas. Because Riven failed to establish a prima facie case, summary judgment was properly granted.

### Copyright Infringement

On the copyright claim, EchoCraft argues its song "Revere Paul Revere?" qualifies as fair use as a matter of law. EchoCraft contends the work is transformative because it serves a distinct educational purpose and employs a question format that invites critical inquiry, rather than simply reproducing Riven's original. The nature of the work—educational music for high school students—supports fair use. The amount borrowed was no more than necessary to achieve the transformative purpose. Finally, EchoCraft maintains that its nonprofit educational use does not harm the potential market for Riven's work. Under these circumstances, no reasonable jury could conclude that EchoCraft infringed Riven's copyright, and the district court correctly resolved the matter at the summary judgment stage.

## III. Plaintiff's Anticipated Theory of the Case

Plaintiff Philip Riven will argue that the district court erred by resolving factual disputes that should have been submitted to a jury. On the retaliation claim, Riven is expected to contend that his internal investigation into bonus assignment practices constituted protected activity because it was undertaken with a reasonable good-faith belief that EchoCraft was engaging in gender-based discrimination. Riven will argue that his investigation focused on disparities affecting Jackie Moses's predominantly female department, and that EchoCraft was aware of the discriminatory nature of his inquiry based on conversations with management. He will further argue that the temporal proximity between his investigation and his termination—combined with differential treatment compared to Moses, who also failed to meet quotas but was not terminated—establishes the required causal connection. Riven seeks reversal and remand for a jury trial.

On the copyright claim, Riven is expected to argue that EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" infringes his copyrighted work "Revere Paul Revere" and does not qualify as fair use. Riven will likely contend that EchoCraft's song is not transformative but rather a near-duplicate that supersedes the original. He will argue that EchoCraft copied a substantial and material portion of his lyrics, and that the use—despite being characterized as educational—had a devastating effect on the market for his work, as evidenced by Columbia Grammar School's termination of negotiations and the collapse of commercial interest in his original composition. Riven seeks reversal of summary judgment and remand for trial on both claims.

## IV. Preliminary Overview of Facts

### Employment History and Retaliation

Philip Riven joined EchoCraft Productions as a songwriter in the country music department on September 4, 2018. He received consistently positive performance reviews and was promoted to Manager of the country songwriting department in February 2020.

In December 2022, at an EchoCraft holiday party, Riven learned from Jackie Moses (manager of the educational songwriting department) and several of her employees that employees in Moses's department—which was predominantly female—were receiving lower bonuses than employees in Riven's department who had comparable performance reviews. On January 10, 2023, Riven and Moses met with Daphne Sniff, head of EchoCraft's songwriting division, to raise concerns about these bonus discrepancies. Sniff told Riven that while she did not believe EchoCraft discriminated in assigning bonuses, Riven was welcome to investigate further.

Between January and May 2023, Riven conducted an extensive internal review, interviewing approximately 81 employees across 12 departments about their performance reviews, bonuses, and base salaries. On July 5, 2023, Sniff informed Riven that he had failed to meet his department's songwriting quotas for six consecutive months and issued him a formal warning. Moses, who held an equivalent management position and similarly failed to meet her quotas for six consecutive months, did not receive a warning. On August 18, 2023, Riven emailed Sniff a summary of his findings regarding bonus award practices. Sniff responded on August 19, 2023: "I take these concerns very seriously. However, are you sure this is the best use of your time right now?"

On December 21, 2023, EchoCraft terminated Riven's employment, citing his failure to meet songwriting quotas as a contributing factor. The parties have stipulated that this termination constitutes an adverse employment action for purposes of the retaliation claim.

### Copyright Dispute

On December 1, 2023, while still employed at EchoCraft, Riven composed an educational song titled "Revere Paul Revere" to help his daughter study for her Advanced Placement United States History class. The song became popular at his daughter's school and other schools. Between January and February 2024, Riven negotiated with Columbia Grammar School principal Elle Toobin for use of "Revere Paul Revere" and future educational songs. Toobin paid Riven a $500 advance. On January 2, 2024, Riven registered a copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office for "Revere Paul Revere."

On or about January 3, 2024, Ryan Raine, EchoCraft's CEO, discovered Riven's original song "Revere Paul Revere." On January 15, 2024, EchoCraft released "Revere Paul Revere?" through its nonprofit educational division, EchoCraft Ed. The song was disseminated to high school students, including at Columbia Grammar School, and became known among teenagers and educators. On February 12, 2024, Columbia Grammar School terminated ongoing negotiations with Riven. As of September 2024, commercial interest in Riven's original composition had effectively vanished.

The parties have stipulated that Riven's copyright in "Revere Paul Revere" is valid and that the work is not a work for hire.

### Procedural History

Riven filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging retaliation under Title VII and copyright infringement. EchoCraft moved for summary judgment on both claims. The district court granted the motion, holding that Riven failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation and that EchoCraft's use of portions of Riven's song constituted fair use as a matter of law. Riven now appeals the final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
