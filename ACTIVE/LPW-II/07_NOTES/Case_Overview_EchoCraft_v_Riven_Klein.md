## I. Procedural Posture and Applicable Legal Standards

Philip Riven appeals from the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of EchoCraft Productions on two independent causes of action: a Title VII retaliation claim and a copyright infringement claim. Both claims were resolved in EchoCraft's favor at the summary judgment stage. The district court concluded that Riven could not establish a prima facie retaliation case and that EchoCraft's use of Riven's copyrighted song qualified as fair use. The appeal is now before the Second Circuit.

**Title VII Retaliation Framework**

Riven's retaliation claim proceeds under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), which makes it unlawful for employers to take adverse action against employees who oppose discriminatory practices or participate in Title VII enforcement mechanisms. Courts analyze such claims using the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. *McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green*, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). The plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case showing: engagement in protected activity, employer knowledge, an adverse employment action, and causation linking the protected activity to the adverse action. *Littlejohn v. City of New York*, 795 F.3d 297, 315-16 (2d Cir. 2015). Here, the parties agree Riven's termination qualifies as an adverse action, leaving protected activity, knowledge, and causation as the contested elements. Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant, no reasonable factfinder could return a verdict for that party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,* *Inc.*, 477 U.S. 242 (1986).

**Fair Use Defense Under Copyright Law**

The copyright dispute turns on whether EchoCraft's song qualifies as fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107. The statute directs courts to consider four non-exclusive factors: the purpose and character of the defendant's use (including its transformative nature), the nature of the plaintiff's copyrighted work, the quantity and importance of the material appropriated, and the market impact on the original work's value. In *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569 (1994), the Supreme Court clarified that transformative works—those adding new meaning, expression, or message to the original—occupy the core of fair use protection because transformation reduces the risk that the new work will replace the original. The parties have stipulated to Riven's copyright validity and that "Revere Paul Revere" is not a work made for hire. The contested issue is whether applying the four statutory factors to EchoCraft's "Revere Paul Revere?" compels a finding of fair use.

## II. Defendant's Position and Arguments

EchoCraft seeks to uphold the summary judgment rulings on both claims. The company's central argument is that Riven cannot satisfy his burden of proof on either the retaliation or infringement theories.

**Retaliation Defense**

EchoCraft contends that Riven's conduct falls outside Title VII's protective scope. The statute shields employees who oppose unlawful practices or engage in EEOC enforcement activities—not those conducting informal inquiries where the employee himself doubts whether discrimination occurred. Riven admits he was unsure whether the bonus disparity he investigated was gender-based. His supervisor Daphne Sniff understood his concerns as departmental rather than discriminatory. CEO Ryan Raine received only vague references to women and testified those references meant little to him at the time. Riven's inquiry was exploratory, not oppositional. He never articulated a clear Title VII concern until August 2023, seven months after he began investigating and five months before his termination.

EchoCraft further maintains that Riven's termination resulted from legitimate performance failures, not retaliation. His department missed production quotas for six consecutive months before receiving a formal warning in July 2023, and continued missing quotas through December—twelve consecutive months total. He was ultimately terminated in December for sustained unsatisfactory performance. EchoCraft's position is that Riven wasted company time pursuing a personal investigation while failing to manage his underperforming team. The law does not require employers to tolerate poor performance from employees conducting ambiguous internal inquiries under the guise of discrimination concerns.

As to causation, the seven-month gap between Riven's August report and his December termination undermines any inference that the two were connected. To establish causation, Riven must identify a similarly situated comparator who received more favorable treatment. He fails to meet that burden. EchoCraft's theory is that Riven cannot establish protected activity, knowledge, or causation. Summary judgment was proper.

**Fair Use Defense**

EchoCraft maintains that "Revere Paul Revere?" represents transformative educational critique protected under fair use doctrine. Riven's original song celebrated Paul Revere uncritically and was designed purely as a memorization tool. It contained historical inaccuracies, including the false claim that Revere revealed no secrets when captured. EchoCraft's version transforms the original's purpose and message. The added question mark in the title conveys a critical transformation from celebration to inquiry. The song corrects factual errors and adds new lines acknowledging overlooked historical narratives. The song provokes critical thinking about whether Paul Revere should truly be revered and about how history is constructed and taught. This is precisely the kind of criticism and commentary that fair use exists to protect.

EchoCraft contends that the four fair use factors, taken together, weigh in favor of fair use. The use is transformative and educational. While the original work is creative, the strength of the transformation and other factors counterbalance this consideration. While EchoCraft used seven of Riven's eight lines, that copying was necessary to identify and correct the inaccuracies being critiqued. In addition, Riven had no established market for his work which was displaced. Schools chose EchoCraft's version because it is more historically accurate and educationally superior, not because it is a cheap substitute for Riven's work. Fair use permits transformative uses that improve public discourse even when substantial copying is required.

## III. Plaintiff's Expected Arguments on Appeal

Riven's appeal likely challenges the propriety of granting summary judgment on factually disputed claims. His position will be that the evidence, viewed favorably to him, presents genuine issues of material fact requiring jury resolution on both the retaliation and copyright claims.

**Retaliation Arguments**

Riven will argue that Title VII's anti-retaliation provision protects employees who oppose gender-based pay discrimination, and that the district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment because genuine disputes of material fact exist regarding protected activity, employer knowledge, and causation. He will contend that investigating suspected gender discrimination in bonus allocation qualifies as protected opposition activity, and that formal certainty is not required for protection under Title VII's Opposition Clause. He will point to evidence of retaliatory animus, including management communications disparaging his investigation and actions that undermined his department's performance. He will identify a similarly situated comparator who received more favorable treatment despite comparable performance issues. Riven will argue these factual disputes should be resolved by a jury rather than on summary judgment.

**Copyright Infringement Arguments**

Riven will likely characterize EchoCraft's song as commercial misappropriation and exploitation rather than transformative use. He will likely contend that EchoCraft copied the substantial majority of his original lyrics verbatim and that this extensive copying cannot be justified as criticism or sufficient transformation.

Riven will likely argue that EchoCraft's parent company benefited commercially from the release and that EchoCraft's characterization of the use as nonprofit and educational is pretextual. Most importantly, Riven will likely point to his lost licensing opportunity as direct evidence of market harm. He will likely argue that after EchoCraft released its version, his active negotiations were terminated and schools chose EchoCraft's song instead. He will likely contend that this demonstrates actual market harm and that EchoCraft's use directly supplanted his opportunity to license his work. He will likely argue that fair use does not permit copying another's work and then competing directly in the same market.

## IV. Relevant Facts

Riven's employment at EchoCraft spanned from September 2018 through December 2023. He rose quickly within the company, earning promotion to Manager of the country songwriting department in February 2020 after only eighteen months. His department performed well in 2021 and 2022, and he received strong performance reviews.

In December 2022, employees at a holiday party expressed concern that departments with more women received lower bonuses than those with more men despite comparable performance reviews. Riven told colleagues he would look into the matter. In January 2023, he met with his supervisor Daphne Sniff to discuss the concern. Sniff testified she understood the conversation as raising a departmental issue rather than a gender discrimination claim. Riven testified he was uncertain at that time whether the disparity was gender-based. Sniff told Riven he was free to investigate. Between January and May 2023, Riven interviewed approximately 81 employees across 12 departments. In August 2023, he submitted a report finding that women received lower average bonuses than men in 9 of 12 departments.

CEO Ryan Raine became aware of Riven's investigation in May 2023. Raine sent an email to Sniff calling Riven a virus infecting company culture and instructing Sniff to keep her subordinates in line. However, Raine testified he understood the investigation concerned bonus shortages generally and that references to women did not mean much to him at the time. Shortly after Raine learned of the investigation, three songwriters were transferred out of Riven's department.

Throughout 2023, Riven's department failed to meet production quotas. After six consecutive months of missed quotas, Sniff issued Riven a formal written warning in July 2023 for unsatisfactory performance. His department continued to miss quotas through December—twelve consecutive months total. Another department was able to meet its quota during the same period with twelve songwriters—the same number Riven's department had after the transfers. Another manager, Jackie Moses, whose department also failed to meet quotas for six months, received no warning. However, Moses had over twenty years more experience than Riven, had been a manager for twelve years longer than Riven, and had a proven track record of recovering from performance dips. Her department met its quota by the fourth quarter of 2023. Riven was terminated in December 2023 for sustained unsatisfactory performance.

After his termination, in December 2023, Riven composed an eight-line educational song titled "Revere Paul Revere" to help his daughter study for her AP U.S. History exam. The song portrayed Paul Revere positively and was designed as a memorization tool. It became popular among students at his daughter's school. In January 2024, Riven registered the copyright. Around this time, the school principal, Elle Toobin, began negotiating with Riven about licensing the song and potentially commissioning additional educational songs for future school years. Toobin paid Riven a five-hundred dollar preliminary negotiation fee. However, no contract was signed, no per-song price was agreed upon, and school budgets for the following year were not finalized. Riven contacted other schools, but none expressed interest in his song.

On January 15, 2024, EchoCraft released its own song titled "Revere Paul Revere?" through its nonprofit educational division. EchoCraft's version retained seven of Riven's eight original lines verbatim and added seven new lines. EchoCraft changed one line to correct what CEO Raine characterized as historical inaccuracies in Riven's original. Specifically, Riven's song claimed Paul Revere revealed no secrets when captured, but historical records show he did reveal some information. EchoCraft's version corrected this error and added lines acknowledging other riders who participated in the midnight warning, including William Dawes, Samuel Prescott, and Sybil Ludington. The title included a question mark to provoke critical inquiry. Raine testified that EchoCraft wanted to create a more historically accurate version and to encourage students to think critically about whether Paul Revere should be revered as uncritically as traditional narratives suggest. EchoCraft distributed the song through its nonprofit educational division and licensed it to schools at or below cost. Shortly after EchoCraft's release, Toobin terminated her negotiations with Riven and chose EchoCraft's version for her school instead.

Riven filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging retaliation under Title VII and copyright infringement under the Copyright Act. EchoCraft moved for summary judgment on both claims. The district court granted the motion, concluding that Riven failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation and that EchoCraft's use of his song constituted fair use as a matter of law. Riven now appeals that final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

## V. Key Legal Issues and Strategic Analysis

**Protected Activity Under Title VII**

The central statutory question in the retaliation claim concerns the scope of protected activity under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). That provision protects two categories of conduct: opposing unlawful employment practices (the Opposition Clause) and participating in Title VII enforcement proceedings (the Participation Clause). EchoCraft's position exploits ambiguity in what qualifies as opposition. The statute requires opposition to an "unlawful employment practice," but does not specify whether an employee must have actual knowledge of a violation or merely reasonable suspicion. Courts have adopted varying approaches. Some require a reasonable good-faith belief that discrimination exists. Others require a clearer articulation of the specific practice opposed. EchoCraft's strength lies in Riven's admitted uncertainty and his supervisor's reasonable interpretation of the concern as departmental rather than discriminatory. EchoCraft's argument is that exploratory investigations undertaken by uncertain employees do not constitute opposition. The weakness is that courts generally view protected activity broadly to effectuate Title VII's remedial purpose. A jury might reasonably conclude that investigating suspected gender discrimination qualifies as opposition even when the employee has not yet confirmed the violation.

The knowledge and causation elements present factual disputes. Raine's email calling Riven a virus supports an inference of retaliatory animus. The temporal proximity between the investigation and the adverse action supports causation. However, the seven-month gap between Riven's August report and December termination weakens that inference. EchoCraft's strongest position is that Riven's sustained performance failures provide a legitimate, non-retaliatory explanation for the termination. The weakness is that Jackie Moses received disparate treatment despite similar performance issues. Whether Moses is a proper comparator presents a factual question that ordinarily would go to a jury.

**Transformation and Market Impact in Fair Use Analysis**

The statutory fair use factors under 17 U.S.C. § 107 require a holistic assessment rather than mechanical application. EchoCraft's strength lies in the transformativeness analysis under the first factor. *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.* established that transformative works—those that add new meaning, message, or expression—receive strong fair use protection even when copying is substantial. EchoCraft added a question mark, corrected factual errors, included historically marginalized figures, and shifted the purpose from celebration to critical inquiry. This transformation is genuine and significant. The Supreme Court has recognized that criticism often requires reproducing portions of the work being criticized. EchoCraft's use aligns with fair use's core purpose of facilitating criticism and commentary.

The weakness in EchoCraft's position concerns the fourth factor—market harm. Riven had preliminary negotiations with Principal Toobin and received a negotiation fee. Toobin terminated those negotiations after EchoCraft's release and chose EchoCraft's version instead. This creates a factual dispute about whether EchoCraft's use harmed an actual or potential market for Riven's work. However, EchoCraft's response is strong: Toobin chose the more accurate, educationally superior version. Fair use does not require inferior works to prevail in the marketplace against transformative improvements. The statutory language protects uses that do not serve as market substitutes for the original. EchoCraft's song serves a different educational purpose—provoking critical inquiry rather than rote memorization. Whether these works compete in the same market or serve different purposes is a close question that could be resolved either way.

## VI. Conclusion

EchoCraft's position on both claims rests on threshold legal requirements that Riven failed to satisfy. On retaliation, Riven did not engage in protected activity as defined by Title VII, and his termination resulted from documented performance failures rather than retaliatory animus. On copyright, EchoCraft's use is transformative educational criticism that corrects inaccuracies and improves public discourse—precisely what fair use is designed to protect. The district court correctly granted summary judgment. EchoCraft seeks affirmance.
