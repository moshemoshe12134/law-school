# Riven v. EchoCraft Productions

**Representing:** EchoCraft Productions (Defendant-Appellee)

This appeal presents two distinct legal issues arising from the same parties. EchoCraft, a music production company, terminated its former employee Philip Riven in December 2023. Riven claims his termination was retaliation for investigating gender-based bonus disparities. Separately, after his termination, Riven composed an educational song about Paul Revere, which EchoCraft later adapted and released through its nonprofit educational division. Riven claims this use infringes his copyright. EchoCraft prevailed on summary judgment on both claims. The district court found Riven failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation and that EchoCraft's use of his song constituted fair use.

## Factual Background

Philip Riven worked at EchoCraft from September 2018 until December 2023. He rose quickly through the company, becoming Manager of the country songwriting department in February 2020 after only eighteen months. His department performed well in 2021 and 2022, exceeding quotas and earning him strong reviews. In 2023, however, his department failed to meet production quotas for twelve consecutive months, and he received a formal warning in July 2023 before ultimately being terminated in December for unsatisfactory performance.

During this period, Riven undertook an investigation into bonus disparities at EchoCraft. In December 2022, employees at a holiday party expressed concern that departments with more women received lower bonuses than those with more men despite comparable performance reviews. Riven said he would look into it. In January 2023, he met with his supervisor Daphne Sniff about the concern. Riven later testified he was uncertain whether the disparity was gender-based, while Sniff understood the concern as a departmental issue rather than a gender-discrimination issue. Sniff told Riven he was free to investigate. Between January and May 2023, Riven interviewed approximately 81 employees across 12 departments. In August 2023, he submitted a report finding that in 9 of 12 departments, women received lower average bonuses than men.

CEO Ryan Raine became aware of Riven's investigation in May 2023. In an email to Sniff, Raine called Riven a virus infecting company culture and told Sniff to keep her subordinates in line. However, Raine testified he understood the investigation concerned bonus shortages generally and that references to women did not mean much to him at the time. Shortly after, three songwriters were transferred out of Riven's department, contributing to his inability to meet quotas. However, another department had been able to meet its quota with twelve songwriters over the same period. In July 2023, Sniff issued Riven a formal warning. Another manager, Jackie Moses, whose department also failed to meet quotas for six months, received no warning. However, Moses had over twenty years more experience than Riven, had been a manager twelve years longer, had a proven track record of recovering from performance dips, and her department actually recovered and met its quota by the fourth quarter of 2023. Riven was terminated in December 2023.

After his termination, in December 2023, Riven composed an eight-line educational song called "Revere Paul Revere" to help his daughter study for her AP U.S. History exam. The song portrayed Paul Revere positively as a great man and was designed as a memorization tool. It became popular among students in his daughter's school. In January 2024, Riven registered the copyright. Around this time, the school principal Elle Toobin began negotiating with Riven about licensing his song and potentially commissioning additional educational songs for future school years. She paid him a five-hundred dollar preliminary negotiation fee, though no contract was signed, no per-song price was set, and school budgets were not finalized.

On January 15, 2024, EchoCraft released its own version titled "Revere Paul Revere?" through its nonprofit educational division. EchoCraft's version kept seven of Riven's eight lines verbatim but added seven new lines and changed one line to correct what CEO Raine described as historical inaccuracies in Riven's original. The new version added a question mark to the title, corrected the claim that Revere revealed no secrets (he actually did reveal some secrets when captured), and included lines acknowledging other riders involved in the midnight warning such as William Dawes, Samuel Prescott, and Sybil Ludington. Raine testified that he wanted to make the song more historically accurate and provoke critical discussion about whether Paul Revere should truly be revered. The song was distributed through EchoCraft's nonprofit educational division and licensed to schools at or below cost. Shortly after EchoCraft's version was released, Toobin terminated negotiations with Riven and chose EchoCraft's version for her school. Riven contacted other schools but none expressed interest.

## Issue One: Title VII Retaliation

The question presented is whether the district court erred in finding that no reasonable jury could conclude Riven established a prima facie case of retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). At its core, this case presents a question of statutory interpretation: Does Title VII intend to protect informal, self-directed employee investigations conducted without clear articulation of Title VII concerns?

To establish a prima facie case, plaintiff must prove he participated in protected activity, defendant had knowledge of it, defendant took a materially adverse action, and there was a causal connection. See Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 315-16 (2d Cir. 2015). The parties stipulated the adverse action. EchoCraft's position is that Riven fails the protected activity, knowledge, and causation elements.

The statute protects employees discriminated against because they "opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this title" (Opposition Clause) or "participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this title" (Participation Clause). 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Riven's conduct satisfies neither.

Riven fails to establish protected activity under the Opposition Clause. He never opposed a Title VII violation but rather investigated whether discrimination existed. He admitted he was not certain the bonus disparity was gender-based. His supervisor Sniff understood the concern as departmental, not discriminatory. On its face, Riven simply told his manager that the bonus disparity looked bad without pointing to a Title VII violation. How could he? He had no idea what metrics went into employee bonuses. The first clear articulation of a gender discrimination claim came in August 2023, seven months after he began investigating. An employee who admits uncertainty, frames concerns as departmental, and merely pokes around to see if discrimination exists has not opposed an unlawful employment practice.

Riven likewise fails under the Participation Clause. The statutory language requires participation "in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this title." He never filed an EEOC charge and no EEOC investigation occurred. His entirely self-directed internal investigation had no connection to Title VII's enforcement apparatus. If any internal investigation qualified as participation under this title, the statutory distinction between opposition and participation would be meaningless.

EchoCraft lacked the required knowledge. Sniff reasonably interpreted the January meeting as raising a departmental concern, not a Title VII claim. Raine heard vague references to women but testified it did not mean much to him. The first clear Title VII claim came in August, seven months before termination, which undermines any temporal proximity argument for causation.

On causation, seven months between the August report and December termination is too long to support an inference based on temporal proximity alone. Riven will point to Jackie Moses as a comparator, but she is not similarly situated. She had over twenty years more experience, twelve years longer as manager, a proven track record of recovery, and her department actually met its quota by year's end. These material differences explain the disparate treatment.

EchoCraft's core theory is this: Riven wasted months on an informal wild goose chase instead of managing his underperforming department. His department missed quotas for twelve consecutive months. Title VII does not protect employees who pursue personal investigations under the guise of discrimination concerns while failing to do their jobs. The statute protects employees who oppose known discrimination or participate in formal EEOC processes, not employees who conduct ambiguous personal investigations. Even viewing all facts in his favor, no reasonable jury could find he established a prima facie case. The district court correctly granted summary judgment.

## Issue Two: Copyright Fair Use

The question presented is whether EchoCraft's song "Revere Paul Revere?" constitutes fair use of Riven's copyrighted song "Revere Paul Revere" under 17 U.S.C. § 107. The parties stipulated that Riven's copyright is valid and that the work is not a work for hire. The legal question is whether the four-factor fair use test supports EchoCraft's use as a matter of law.

Fair use is codified at 17 U.S.C. § 107, which sets forth four factors: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is transformative; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994). The central dispute concerns whether EchoCraft's use is transformative criticism protected by fair use or whether it is commercial appropriation that harms Riven's market.

**Factor One: Purpose and Character of Use**

EchoCraft's song is transformative educational criticism. Riven's original celebrated Paul Revere as a great man and was designed purely as a memorization tool for students. EchoCraft's version fundamentally transforms that purpose and message. It adds a question mark to the title, questioning whether Revere should be revered. It corrects historical inaccuracies in Riven's original, including the false claim that Revere revealed no secrets (he actually did when captured). It acknowledges the roles of other riders overlooked in traditional narratives—William Dawes, Samuel Prescott, and Sybil Ludington. The new version provokes critical thinking about how history is constructed and taught rather than simply celebrating one historical figure.

The song was released through EchoCraft's nonprofit educational division and licensed to schools at or below cost. While Riven points to improved press coverage and modest revenue increases for EchoCraft's parent company, the primary purpose was educational. Incidental benefits to a parent company do not transform a nonprofit educational use into a commercial one. This is criticism and commentary—uses that fair use explicitly protects.

**Factor Two: Nature of the Copyrighted Work**

Riven's work is a factual educational song about historical events. It consists largely of basic historical facts, famous phrases like "one if by land, two if by sea," and geographic names. This factual, informational nature weighs in favor of fair use compared to highly creative fictional works. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586.

**Factor Three: Amount and Substantiality Used**

EchoCraft used seven of Riven's eight original lines, which is approximately 87.5% of the original. This is substantial. However, the final work contains fourteen lines total—seven from Riven and seven new lines—making the final work fifty percent new material. The copying was reasonable to accomplish the transformative purpose. To effectively criticize and correct a work's historical inaccuracies, one must present what is being critiqued. Much of what was copied consists of basic historical facts and famous phrases rather than highly creative expression. The extent of copying was reasonable in relation to the critical purpose.

**Factor Four: Effect on the Potential Market**

Riven had no established market for his song. He had preliminary discussions with school principal Elle Toobin, received a five-hundred dollar negotiation fee, but had no signed contract, no agreed-upon per-song price, and no finalized school budgets. Other schools never expressed interest. This speculative potential does not constitute an actual or potential market that fair use must protect.

Moreover, schools chose EchoCraft's version because it was more historically accurate and educationally superior, not because it was a cheap substitute for Riven's work. A work that serves a different and improved educational purpose is not a market substitute in the relevant sense. Copyright does not give creators the right to control the market for criticism and correction of their work. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 591-92 (criticism substitutes in the market for criticism, not for the original).

**EchoCraft's Position**

Riven will argue that copying 87.5% of his work is excessive and that EchoCraft could have written an entirely new song. He will characterize the use as commercial appropriation disguised as criticism and point to his lost deal with Toobin as direct market harm. However, EchoCraft's use was necessary to accomplish its critical purpose, the work was distributed through nonprofit educational channels, and Riven cannot claim harm to a market that never materialized. Fair use exists precisely to allow transformative uses that correct inaccuracies and improve public discourse, even when substantial copying is required. All four factors support fair use. The district court correctly granted summary judgment.

## Conclusion

EchoCraft's position on both issues rests on the same fundamental principle: the law does not protect unfounded claims. On the retaliation claim, Riven's ambiguous, self-directed investigation does not constitute the kind of protected activity Title VII contemplates, and his termination resulted from legitimate performance concerns. On the copyright claim, EchoCraft's song is transformative educational criticism released through nonprofit channels, using portions of Riven's work to correct inaccuracies and provoke critical thinking. The district court correctly granted summary judgment on both claims.
