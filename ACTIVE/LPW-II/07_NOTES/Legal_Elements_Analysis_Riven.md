# Prima Facie Retaliation Case Analysis: Riven v. EchoCraft

## The Four Elements (per Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 315-16 (2d Cir. 2015))

1. Protected activity
2. Employer knowledge of protected activity
3. Adverse employment action (STIPULATED)
4. Causal connection between protected activity and adverse action

---

## ELEMENT 1: PROTECTED ACTIVITY

### Statutory Framework (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a))

Two distinct clauses:

**Opposition Clause:** "because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice"

**Participation Clause:** "because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing **under this title**"

---

### Timeline: What Happened When

| Date | Event | Riven's Characterization | EchoCraft's Characterization |
|------|-------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Dec 21, 2022** | Holiday party conversation | Employees raise gender discrimination concern; Riven promises to investigate | Employees speculate; no clear Title VII claim articulated |
| **Jan 10, 2023** | Meeting with Sniff | **[RIVEN: PROTECTED ACTIVITY BEGINS]** Investigation into gender discrimination in bonuses | Meeting about departmental bonus disparities; gender mentioned ambiguously; "free to poke around" ≠ opposition |
| **Jan-May 2023** | Conducts investigation | Ongoing protected activity—investigating Title VII violation | Self-directed inquiry; not formal complaint; not EEOC proceeding; framed ambiguously throughout |
| **Aug 18, 2023** | Report submitted | **[RIVEN: CLEAREST PROTECTED ACTIVITY]** Formal report documenting gender pay disparities | First clear articulation of gender claim—but 7 months after alleged "protected activity" began |

---

### Riven Will Argue:

**Opposition Clause:** 
- January 10, 2023 meeting = opposed EchoCraft's bonus discrimination practices
- Investigation itself = opposition to Title VII violation
- Reasonable belief discrimination existed based on holiday party conversation
- August report = culmination of opposition

**Participation Clause:**
- Conducted investigation "under Title VII" 
- Interviewed 81 employees about discrimination
- Documented findings in formal report

---

### EchoCraft Will Argue:

#### A. Opposition Clause Fails

**1. No "Opposition" to Title VII Practice**

**What happened:** Riven conducted informal, self-directed investigation without ever filing complaint or clearly articulating Title VII concern

**Legal standard needed:** What constitutes "opposition"?
- Must employee file formal complaint?
- Is informal investigation sufficient?
- Must opposition be explicit and unambiguous?

**Case law gap #1:** **Second Circuit cases defining minimum threshold for "opposition"**
- Need: Cases holding informal investigation ≠ opposition
- Need: Cases requiring clear communication of Title VII concern
- Need: Cases distinguishing "inquiry" from "opposition"

**Our argument:** Opposition requires affirmative challenge to employer practice. Riven merely investigated whether discrimination existed—he never opposed a known discriminatory practice. At January 10 meeting, he expressed curiosity, not opposition.

---

**2. No "Reasonable Belief" of Title VII Violation**

**What happened:** 
- January 10: Riven "wasn't certain it was gender based" (Record p.23)
- Sniff perceived it as "departmental issue, not gender one" (Record p.44)
- Riven was "skeptical" at holiday party (Record p.22)

**Legal standard needed:** What constitutes "reasonable belief"?
- Must employee believe Title VII violation is occurring?
- Is suspecting "something might be wrong" sufficient?
- Can employee have "reasonable belief" while admitting uncertainty?

**Case law gap #2:** **Second Circuit "reasonable belief" standard**
- Need: Cases defining what level of certainty required
- Need: Cases holding suspicion/curiosity insufficient
- Need: Cases requiring belief that INTENTIONAL discrimination occurring (not just disparities)

**Our argument:** Reasonable belief requires employee believes Title VII violation is occurring. Finding statistical disparities ≠ believing intentional gender discrimination. Riven admitted he was "skeptical" and "wasn't certain"—this doesn't meet reasonable belief standard.

---

**3. Ambiguous Communication Negates Opposition**

**What happened:**
- January 10: Framed as "departmental" concern (Sniff testimony)
- Riven mentioned "women" but in context of departments
- Never said "I believe EchoCraft is violating Title VII"
- Only August 18 report clearly articulates gender discrimination claim

**Legal standard needed:** Communication requirements for opposition
- How clearly must employee articulate Title VII concern?
- Does ambiguous framing defeat opposition claim?
- Must employer reasonably understand concern involves Title VII?

**Case law gap #3:** **Second Circuit cases on clarity of communication**
- Need: Cases requiring explicit Title VII framing
- Need: Cases holding ambiguous complaints don't put employer on notice
- Need: Cases on employer's reasonable interpretation of complaint

**Our argument:** Opposition requires clear enough communication that employer understands employee believes Title VII violation occurring. Sniff reasonably interpreted January 10 meeting as departmental concern, not Title VII claim. Ambiguous framing = no opposition.

---

#### B. Participation Clause Fails

**What happened:** Riven never filed EEOC charge; never participated in EEOC investigation; self-directed internal investigation only

**Legal standard needed:** Meaning of "under this title"
- Does it require EEOC involvement?
- Can internal investigation = participation "under" Title VII?
- What makes investigation "under this title" vs. personal project?

**Case law gap #4:** **Second Circuit interpretation of participation clause**
- Need: Cases requiring formal EEOC process for "participation"
- Need: Cases holding self-directed investigation not "under this title"
- Need: Cases on distinction between participation clause and opposition clause

**Our argument:** "Under this title" means under Title VII's enforcement mechanisms = EEOC process. Participation clause covers employees who engage with formal EEOC complaints, investigations, proceedings. Riven's personal investigation was not "under" Title VII—it was a private inquiry. If any investigation qualified as "participation," the statutory distinction between opposition and participation would be meaningless.

---

## ELEMENT 2: EMPLOYER KNOWLEDGE

### Timeline: What EchoCraft Knew When

| Date | EchoCraft Knowledge | Title VII Connection? |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Jan 10, 2023** | Sniff: Riven concerned about departmental bonus disparities | NO—"departmental issue, not gender one" |
| **May 24, 2023** | Raine: Riven investigating "vendetta" about bonuses; heard mention of "departments with a lot of women" | MAYBE—but "didn't mean much to me at the time" |
| **June 2023** | Sniff tells Raine received report about findings; will evaluate | UNKNOWN—content not yet disclosed |
| **Aug 18, 2023** | Sniff receives report clearly articulating gender discrimination | **YES—first clear Title VII claim** |

---

### Riven Will Argue:

- January 10: Sniff knew investigation concerned gender discrimination
- May 24: Raine knew investigation concerned women and bonuses
- EchoCraft cannot claim ignorance when Riven mentioned "women" explicitly
- Knowledge imputed from supervisors to company

---

### EchoCraft Will Argue:

**Knowledge requires employer knew employee believed Title VII violation occurring**

**What happened:**
- January 10: Sniff reasonably interpreted as departmental concern
- May 24: Raine heard about "vendetta" and "women" but "didn't mean much to me"
- August 18: First clear Title VII claim—but 7 months before termination

**Legal standard needed:** Specificity of knowledge required
- Must employer know specifically about Title VII claim?
- Is knowledge of "general complaint" sufficient?
- Does employer's reasonable interpretation matter?
- Can ambiguous communication defeat knowledge element?

**Case law gap #5:** **Second Circuit cases on employer knowledge standard**
- Need: Cases requiring specific knowledge of Title VII nature
- Need: Cases on whether employer's reasonable interpretation controls
- Need: Cases on when ambiguous complaints insufficient for knowledge

**Our argument:** Knowledge requires employer knew employee believed Title VII violation occurring. Sniff reasonably interpreted January meeting as departmental concern—no Title VII knowledge. Raine heard vague reference to women but didn't understand Title VII claim—no knowledge. First clear Title VII claim was August 18—seven months before termination, undermining causal connection.

---

## ELEMENT 3: ADVERSE ACTION

**STIPULATED** - Termination is adverse action.

---

## ELEMENT 4: CAUSAL CONNECTION

### Legal Framework (per Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000))

Three ways to show causation:
1. Close temporal proximity
2. Disparate treatment compared to similarly situated employee
3. Retaliatory animus

---

### Timeline: Causation Analysis

| Protected Activity (per Riven) | Adverse Action | Time Gap |
|-------------------------------|----------------|----------|
| Jan 10, 2023 (investigation begins) | Dec 21, 2023 (termination) | **11 months** |
| Aug 18, 2023 (report submitted) | Dec 21, 2023 (termination) | **7 months** |
| Aug 18, 2023 (report submitted) | Nov 2023 (termination decision) | **~3-4 months** |

---

### Method 1: Temporal Proximity

**Riven will argue:**
- 7 months (report to termination) shows causal connection
- Performance issues existed before investigation but warning only came after
- Suspicious timing of July warning (2 months after Raine "virus" email)

**EchoCraft will argue:**
- 7 months too long for temporal proximity inference
- Performance issues predated any "protected activity"
- January-June 2023: Failing quotas (concurrent with investigation)
- July warning: Legitimate response to 6 months poor performance
- Decision made in legitimate business cycle (year-end review)

**Legal standard needed:** Temporal proximity threshold
- How close is "close"?
- Is 7 months too long?
- Does intervening legitimate business cycle break causation?

**Case law gap #6:** **Second Circuit cases on temporal proximity**
- Need: Cases establishing timeframe for "close" proximity
- Need: Cases holding 7+ months too long
- Need: Cases on intervening legitimate business reasons

---

### Method 2: Disparate Treatment (Comparator: Jackie Moses)

**Riven will argue:**
- Moses had identical performance issues (failed quotas 6 months)
- Moses received NO warning; Riven received formal warning
- Moses not terminated; Riven terminated
- Only difference: Riven investigated discrimination; Moses declined to participate
- Direct evidence of retaliation

**EchoCraft will argue:**

**Moses NOT similarly situated in all material respects**

| Factor | Riven | Moses |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Hire date** | Sept 2018 | March 2000 (20 years earlier) |
| **Manager since** | Feb 2020 | 2008 (12 years longer) |
| **Track record** | 3 years (2 good, 1 bad) | 15+ years; history of dips & recovery |
| **Institutional status** | Recent promotion | "I started this department. I'm an institution." |
| **Dept founder** | No | Yes |
| **Q4 2023 recovery** | No—continued failing | Yes—met quota |
| **Employer perception** | Underperformer w/o proven ability to recover | Proven ability to recover from dips |

**Legal standard needed:** "Similarly situated" requirements
- What factors matter for comparator analysis?
- How much difference in experience/tenure disqualifies comparator?
- Does track record of recovery matter?
- Must comparator be identically situated or merely similar?

**Case law gap #7:** **Second Circuit "similarly situated employee" standard**
- Need: Cases defining "similarly situated in all material respects"
- Need: Cases on significance of experience/tenure differential
- Need: Cases on track record as relevant factor
- Need: Cases holding 20-year experience gap disqualifies comparator

**Our argument:** Moses not valid comparator. She had 20+ years more experience, 12+ years longer as manager, proven track record of recovery, and actually recovered in Q4 2023. These are material differences. Sniff's different treatment of Moses was based on legitimate factors—not retaliation for investigation. Riven cannot establish causation through disparate treatment when comparator is materially different.

---

### Method 3: Retaliatory Animus

**Riven will argue:**
- Raine's May 24 email: "virus infecting company culture"; "vendetta"
- Sniff's Aug 19 response: questioning if investigation "best use of your time"
- Transfer of 3 songwriters (July 2023) after Raine email
- Sniff admission: Riven "was getting on my nerves"
- Sniff's unusual decision not to meet with Riven personally at termination

**EchoCraft will argue:**

**No animus toward Title VII activity—only toward poor performance and productivity disruption**

**What the evidence shows:**
- Raine email: frustrated by "vendetta" and productivity disruption—NOT by Title VII claim
- Raine didn't know investigation concerned Title VII (testimony: "didn't mean much to me")
- Sniff response: concerned about time management, not Title VII activity
- Songwriter transfer: legitimate business need (Pop dept growth)
- "Getting on my nerves": frustrated by poor performance, not investigation
- All termination communications cite only performance reasons

**Legal standard needed:** What constitutes retaliatory animus?
- Can frustration with productivity disruption = retaliatory animus?
- Must animus be directed at Title VII activity specifically?
- How to distinguish legitimate frustration from retaliatory animus?
- Does employer's lack of knowledge about Title VII nature negate animus?

**Case law gap #8:** **Second Circuit cases on retaliatory animus**
- Need: Cases distinguishing retaliation from legitimate frustration
- Need: Cases requiring animus toward Title VII activity (not just employee)
- Need: Cases on relevance of employer's knowledge to animus analysis

**Our argument:** No retaliatory animus toward Title VII activity. Raine was frustrated by productivity disruption and "vendetta"—he didn't know investigation concerned Title VII. Sniff was concerned about time management and poor performance—not the investigation's subject matter. All termination decisions based on legitimate performance concerns. Frustration with underperforming employee ≠ retaliatory animus.

---

## SUMMARY: CASE LAW GAPS TO FILL

### Element 1: Protected Activity

1. **Opposition threshold**: Cases defining minimum conduct for "opposition" (informal investigation insufficient)
2. **Reasonable belief standard**: Cases requiring belief (not suspicion) that Title VII violation occurring
3. **Communication clarity**: Cases requiring explicit Title VII framing; ambiguous complaints insufficient
4. **Participation clause**: Cases requiring EEOC involvement; "under this title" = formal process

### Element 2: Knowledge

5. **Knowledge specificity**: Cases requiring employer know specifically about Title VII claim (not general complaint)

### Element 4: Causation

6. **Temporal proximity**: Cases establishing 7+ months too long for proximity inference
7. **Similarly situated**: Cases defining material respects for comparator; experience/tenure differential disqualifies
8. **Retaliatory animus**: Cases distinguishing legitimate frustration from retaliation; requiring animus toward Title VII activity specifically

---

## LITIGATION POSTURE

**Key strategic point:** Accept ALL of Riven's facts. This is purely a legal question: Does his conduct meet the legal standards for each element?

**Our burden:** Show no reasonable jury could find prima facie case established—even viewing facts in light most favorable to Riven.

**Our approach:** Don't fight the facts—fight the law. Establish high bars for each element through Second Circuit precedent, then show Riven's conduct falls short of those bars.
