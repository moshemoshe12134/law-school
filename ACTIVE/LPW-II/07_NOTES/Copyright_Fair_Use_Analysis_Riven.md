# Riven v. EchoCraft Productions: Copyright Fair Use Analysis

**Issue 2:** Did the district court err in granting summary judgment for EchoCraft and determining that EchoCraft's use of portions of Riven's song constituted fair use?

---

## I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### Riven's Song: "Revere Paul Revere"

**December 2023:** Riven composed "Revere Paul Revere" to help his daughter study for AP U.S. History exam. Eight-line song about Paul Revere's midnight ride, portraying Revere positively as "great man." Based on tour guide information and Wikipedia. (Record p.27-28)

**Song characteristics:**
- 8 lines total
- Rhyming couplets
- Educational purpose (high school history)
- Final line: "He revealed no secrets, the man was not skittish" (Riven admits may not be historically accurate) (Record p.30)

**Popularity:** Song shared within daughter's class at Columbia Grammar, spread to other classes and schools. Students performed well on exams. (Record p.34-35)

**January 2, 2024:** Riven registered copyright. (Complaint ¶21)

**January-February 2024:** Principal Elle Toobin negotiated with Riven for use of song and future educational songs. Offered $500 "preliminary negotiation fee," discussed 5-10 songs for 2024-25 school year, potential bonus if 75%+ students scored 4+ on AP exam. Toobin wrote "Sounds good. We'll talk more soon." No contract signed, no per-song price set, budget not finalized until August. (Record p.28-29, 80-86, Exhibit I)

### EchoCraft's Song: "Revere Paul Revere?"

**January 3, 2024:** CEO Ryan Raine discovered Riven's original song. (Complaint ¶22)

**January 15, 2024:** EchoCraft released "Revere Paul Revere?" through nonprofit educational division (EchoCraft Ed). (Record p.70, 72-73)

**Song characteristics:**
- 14 lines total (7 lines identical to Riven's, 7 new lines)
- Educational purpose (high school history)
- Adds questioning tone: title ends with "?"
- Corrections: "He revealed some secrets, the man was skittish"
- New lines acknowledge: other riders (Dawes, Prescott, Ludington), incomplete traditional story, complications in Revere's legacy
- Licensed to schools at/below cost ($200 to Columbia Grammar) (Record p.74-75)

**Raine's testimony about purpose:**
- Recently attended NY Historical Society exhibit on Revere emphasizing complications in his legacy
- Wanted to make song "more historically accurate"
- "Deep rumination on the problematic character" of celebrated figure
- Emphasize others involved in midnight ride
- Provoke critical discussion: "Should Paul Revere be revered?" (Record p.76-77, 86-87)

**Business context:**
- EchoCraft facing bad press for wasteful recycling and hazing; sales stagnating
- Released song to boost nonprofit education division's image
- Generated positive press (NY Times, New Yorker, WSJ, Village Voice)
- Revenue improved from -5% to +2% after release (Record p.72-73)

**February 14, 2024:** Toobin terminated negotiations with Riven, chose EchoCraft's version. (Exhibit I)

## II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK: THE FOUR-FACTOR FAIR USE TEST

### Statutory Provision (17 U.S.C. § 107)

Fair use determination considers:

1. **Purpose and character** of use, including whether commercial or nonprofit educational
2. **Nature** of copyrighted work
3. **Amount and substantiality** of portion used in relation to whole
4. **Effect** on potential market or value of copyrighted work

"The fair use of a copyrighted work... for purposes such as **criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching** (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."

### Controlling Precedent

**Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994):** Central question for Factor 1 is "whether and to what extent the new work is **transformative**."

**Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith, 598 U.S. 508 (2023):** Transformativeness inquiry focuses on purpose and character; commercial nature matters even when some educational purpose exists.

---

## III. THE CORE DISPUTE

**At its core, this case asks: Does copying 7 out of 8 lines from an educational song constitute fair use when the purpose is to create a more historically accurate version that critiques the original's inaccuracies?**

### Riven's Position

Riven will argue EchoCraft copied 87.5% of his creative work (7/8 lines verbatim). He will characterize:
- Purpose as commercial (boosted company image, improved revenue)
- Copying as excessive—only added 7 lines to 7 copied lines
- Market harm as direct—lost deal with Toobin, lost other school opportunities
- Use as substitute, not transformative criticism

Riven will argue EchoCraft could have written entirely new song with accurate historical facts. Copying was lazy appropriation, not necessary criticism.

### EchoCraft's Position

**EchoCraft's core theory: The song is transformative criticism and educational commentary. It uses Riven's historically inaccurate lines specifically to correct them and provoke critical discussion about historical narratives. This is precisely what fair use protects—criticism, commentary, and teaching that challenges and improves upon prior works.**

The song's purpose is fundamentally different from Riven's: not to celebrate Revere, but to question whether he should be revered. The copying was reasonable to accomplish this critical purpose. The work was distributed through nonprofit educational channels without profit. And Riven had no established market to harm—only speculative potential sales.

---

## IV. FOUR-FACTOR ANALYSIS

### FACTOR 1: Purpose and Character of Use

**Legal Standard:** Whether use is transformative—adds new expression, meaning, or message. Commercial nature relevant but not dispositive.

#### A. Transformative Purpose: Criticism and Commentary

**The argument:** EchoCraft's song fundamentally transforms Riven's purpose and message.

**Riven's purpose:** Celebrate Paul Revere as "great man"; help students memorize facts for test

**EchoCraft's purpose:** Question whether Revere should be revered; provoke critical thinking about historical narratives; correct inaccuracies; acknowledge complexity

**Key transformative elements:**
1. **Title transformation:** "Revere Paul Revere" → "Revere Paul Revere?" (questioning, not celebrating)
2. **Tone transformation:** Celebratory → Critical inquiry
3. **Content transformation:** Adds 7 lines acknowledging other riders, Revere's capture/secrets, incomplete traditional story
4. **Pedagogical transformation:** Memorization tool → Critical thinking prompt
5. **Historical transformation:** Inaccurate ("revealed no secrets") → Accurate ("revealed some secrets")

**Raine testimony:** Song is "deep rumination on the problematic character" of celebrated figure; provokes discussion about whether Revere should be revered; emphasizes role of others (Dawes, Prescott, Ludington). (Record p.70, 76-77, 86-87)

**Toobin testimony:** Added lines "solicit a critical discussion about Revere's legacy" in way original doesn't. Asked if additions significant given they "solicit a critical discussion," she agreed: "assuming EchoCraft's song is accurate, I think there are educational benefits to asking questions about Paul Revere's legacy." (Record p.86-87)

**Case law needed:**
1. Second Circuit cases on transformative use for educational criticism/commentary
2. Cases holding correction of factual inaccuracies = transformative
3. Cases on transformative purpose when both works serve educational market
4. Post-Warhol analysis of transformativeness in same-purpose contexts

**Connection to facts:** The song doesn't merely reproduce Riven's work for same purpose—it uses Riven's inaccurate, celebratory lines as springboard for critical historical inquiry. This is classic transformative criticism.

#### B. Nonprofit Educational Purpose

**The weak point for Riven:** Song distributed through nonprofit division at/below cost.

**Key facts:**
- Released through EchoCraft Ed (nonprofit educational division)
- Licensed to Columbia Grammar for $200—below production/distribution cost
- Raine testimony: "We distributed it at below cost... we did not make a profit" (Record p.77)
- Educational division "donates profits to charity" (Record p.83)

**Riven's counter:** Commercial benefit to parent company—improved press, boosted revenue from -5% to +2%

**EchoCraft's response:** Primary purpose was educational, not commercial. Incidental benefits to parent company don't transform nonprofit educational use into commercial use.

**Legal argument:** Commercial benefits incidental to primary nonprofit educational purpose should not defeat fair use. Courts consider primary purpose, not every possible benefit.

**Case law needed:**
1. Second Circuit cases on when incidental commercial benefits defeat nonprofit educational purpose
2. Cases on nonprofit subsidiary releasing educational materials
3. Cases distinguishing primary purpose from secondary effects

**Connection to facts:** Song released through nonprofit channel, licensed at/below cost to schools for educational use. That parent company received incidental PR benefit doesn't change primary educational purpose.

#### C. The "Criticism" and "Teaching" Statutory Categories

**The argument:** Section 107 explicitly protects "criticism, comment... teaching."

**What EchoCraft's song does:**
- **Criticizes** Riven's historical inaccuracies ("revealed no secrets" vs. "revealed some secrets")
- **Comments** on incomplete traditional narrative
- **Teaches** more accurate, nuanced history
- **Provokes** critical thinking about historical figures

**Why copying was necessary:** To criticize specific inaccurate claims, must quote them. Can't effectively criticize "revealed no secrets" claim without showing audience what you're correcting.

**Case law needed:**
1. Second Circuit cases on scope of "criticism" and "teaching" in Section 107
2. Cases on amount of copying permissible for criticism
3. Cases on whether correcting factual errors = protected criticism

**Connection to facts:** Song uses Riven's lines specifically to correct and critique them—this is core fair use purpose.

---

### FACTOR 2: Nature of Copyrighted Work

**Legal Standard:** "Scope of fair use is greater for factual than creative works." Creative works get more protection. (Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 348-51 (1991))

#### Understanding Factor 2

This factor evaluates whether copyrighted work is:
- **Factual vs. creative:** Facts get less protection; creative expression gets more
- **Published vs. unpublished:** Published works more susceptible to fair use
- **Informational vs. artistic:** Informational works get less protection

**The problem for EchoCraft:** Riven's song is creative work (original rhymes, phrasing, arrangement). This factor cuts against fair use.

**But:** This factor alone not dispositive. Campbell: Factor 2 "not likely to help much" in fair use analysis when dealing with creative works. Factor 2's weight varies depending on other factors—particularly whether use is transformative. (Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578-79)

**EchoCraft's argument:** 
- While song contains creative elements (rhymes), it's fundamentally **informational/educational**
- Purpose is conveying historical facts, not artistic expression
- Riven himself testified process was taking "facts that my daughter needed to know for her test and arranged them in a creative way" (Record p.28)
- To extent Riven's work is factual (dates, events, names), those facts not protectable

**Riven's counter:** Rhyming couplets, specific word choices, phrasing all creative expression deserving full protection

**Likely outcome:** This factor favors Riven but is not dispositive given transformative nature of use.

**Case law needed:**
1. Second Circuit cases on Factor 2 weight when copying educational/informational works
2. Cases on Factor 2 in context of strongly transformative uses (Campbell principle)

---

### FACTOR 3: Amount and Substantiality of Portion Used

**Legal Standard:** "Whether quantity and value of materials used are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying." (Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586)

**The key question:** Was extent of copying reasonable to accomplish transformative critical purpose?

#### A. Quantitative Analysis

**What was copied:**
- 7 out of 8 lines (87.5%) from Riven's song
- Verbatim copying of those 7 lines

**What was added:**
- 7 new lines (50% of final work is new)
- Question mark in title
- Changed 1 line (secrets line) to correct inaccuracy

**Riven's argument:** 87.5% verbatim copying is excessive—could have written entirely new song with accurate facts.

#### B. Qualitative Analysis: Which Lines Were Copied and Why?

**EchoCraft's argument:** Need to examine what was copied and whether copying was reasonable for critical purpose.

**Lines copied (analyzing their nature):**

1. "It was the night of April 18, 1775" - **Basic historical fact**, not particularly creative
2. "A night made famous by Paul's historic ride" - **Historical fact with minimal creative expression**
3. "One if by land, two if by sea" - **Famous historical phrase, widely known**
4. "Such was Revere's signal to warn of the enemy" - **Historical explanation**
5. "Through Somerville, Arlington, and Medford he rode" - **Geographic facts**
6. "The British are coming, the great man bellowed" - **Famous historical phrase**
7. "Captured at gunpoint by the soldiers of the British" - **Historical fact**

**Analysis of creativity levels:**
- Several lines are essentially factual recitation
- "One if by land, two if by sea" is famous historical phrase, not Riven's original expression
- Geographic names are facts
- Most creativity is in rhyme scheme and arrangement, less in individual line content

**Why this amount of copying was reasonable:**
- To establish historical context being critiqued
- To show students what traditional narrative says before questioning it
- To effectively criticize inaccuracies, must present what you're criticizing
- Seven new lines transform work—50% of final song is new critical content

**Campbell principle:** "Parody has an obvious claim to transformative value... For the purposes of copyright law, the heart is also what most readily conjures up the work parodied, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim." (Campbell, 510 U.S. at 588)

**Application:** EchoCraft needed to copy core narrative to effectively question and criticize it.

**Case law needed:**
1. Second Circuit cases on amount permissible for educational criticism
2. Cases on copying factual/historical content vs. creative expression
3. Post-Warhol analysis of amount in same-market transformative uses
4. Cases on whether copying "heart" permissible when purpose is criticism

**Connection to facts:** While percentage high, copying was reasonable to establish historical narrative being critiqued. Final work is 50% new material that transforms purpose.

---

### FACTOR 4: Effect on Potential Market or Value

**Legal Standard:** "Fair use is limited to copying which does not materially impair the marketability of the work which is copied." (Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566-67)

**The key question:** Does EchoCraft's use harm Riven's market or potential market?

#### A. The Summary Judgment Context

**Critical point:** This is summary judgment. Facts aren't disputed—legal standard is.

**What happened (undisputed):**
- Toobin negotiated with Riven, paid $500 advance
- After EchoCraft released song, Toobin terminated negotiations
- Riven tried contacting other schools, none interested
- Riven claims commercial interest in his song "effectively vanished"

**The fight is about LAW, not facts:** What constitutes "potential market" for Factor 4 purposes?

#### B. EchoCraft's Argument: No Established Market Existed

**The weak point for Riven:** He had no established market—only preliminary negotiations.

**Key facts:**
- **No contract signed** - Toobin and Riven never signed agreement (Record p.85-86)
- **No price set** - No per-song fee agreed for 2024-25 school year; Toobin speculated "$200 per song? I don't know. I really don't" (Record p.81-82)
- **No budget finalized** - School budgets not set until August before academic year; Toobin admitted "It's possible" there would be no room in budget (Record p.86)
- **Preliminary only** - Toobin's "Sounds good. We'll talk more soon" ≠ final agreement; she confirmed they would need to "talk again" (Record p.86)
- **Only one potential customer** - No other schools expressed interest; Riven just sent copies, no responses (Record p.31, 37)
- **Speculative future** - Whole deal contingent on future developments (budget, student performance, further negotiations)

**Legal argument:** "Potential market" must be something more concrete than preliminary discussions with one potential customer. Otherwise, every fair use would be blocked because original creator might someday, possibly, sell to someone.

**Distinguish between:**
- **Established market** - Actual sales, contracted deals, proven demand
- **Potential market** - Realistic future opportunities based on current demand
- **Speculative interest** - Preliminary discussions, maybe-someday possibilities

Riven had only speculative interest, not established or potential market.

**Case law needed:**
1. Second Circuit cases defining "potential market" for Factor 4
2. Cases on whether preliminary negotiations = potential market
3. Cases on level of concreteness required
4. Cases on burden: Must defendant show no market harm, or must plaintiff show established market?

#### C. The "Market Substitution" Question

**Riven's argument:** EchoCraft's song is direct market substitute—schools using it instead of his.

**EchoCraft's counter: Not a substitute when works serve different purposes**

**Different purposes:**
- **Riven's song:** Memorization tool for facts; celebrates Revere
- **EchoCraft's song:** Critical thinking tool; questions Revere; more historically accurate

**Toobin testimony on why schools chose EchoCraft:**
- "Historically accurate" - preferred accurate version over inaccurate (Record p.83, 87)
- "Solicit a critical discussion" - educational value in questioning (Record p.86-87)
- "More information" - added lines provide fuller picture (Record p.86)
- Big company resources - "They have lots of songwriters" vs. Riven working alone (Record p.83)

**Legal argument:** Schools chose EchoCraft's version because it serves different, superior educational purpose—not because it's cheap substitute. Work that transforms original and adds educational value is not mere market substitute.

**Campbell/Google Books principle:** Transformative works that serve different purpose from original don't harm market because they're not substitutes. (Campbell, 510 U.S. at 591; Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202, 223 (2d Cir. 2015))

**Case law needed:**
1. Second Circuit cases on market substitution vs. transformative use
2. Cases on whether improved/corrected version substitutes for inaccurate original
3. Post-Warhol analysis of market harm when both serve educational purposes

#### D. Derivative Market for Criticism

**Final point:** Riven has no legitimate right to control market for criticism of his work.

**Legal principle:** Copyright holders don't control derivative market for parodies, critiques, and commentary about their works. That's the whole point of fair use.

**EchoCraft's argument:** If Riven could block critical, more accurate versions of his song, it would frustrate fair use's purpose. Copyright doesn't give creator monopoly over corrections of their factual errors.

**Case law needed:**
1. Cases on copyright holder's rights to control critical derivative works
2. Campbell's parody principles applied to educational criticism

---

## V. DISTRICT COURT'S REASONING

The district court held EchoCraft's use was fair use because:

1. **Factor 1 (Transformative):** "Highly transformative because it presented a fresh perspective on Revere's legacy." Not "sufficient evidence" tying song to revenue growth, so "nonprofit nature." (Record p.110)

2. **Factor 2 (Nature):** Creative work, cuts against fair use, but "not sufficient to disentitle EchoCraft to fair use defense" when joined with other factors. (Record p.110)

3. **Factor 3 (Amount):** Borrowing "not so excessive as to outweigh finding of transformation." Qualitative transformation outweighs quantitative borrowing. (Record p.110)

4. **Factor 4 (Market):** Highly transformative use "did not harm the market." Because "more historically accurate and suitable for classroom use," not "direct substitute." (Record p.110-111)

**Conclusion:** "Under these factors, taken together, EchoCraft's use constituted a fair use."

---

## VI. ECHOCRAFT'S POSITION SUMMARY

**The purpose of EchoCraft's song was education—specifically, to correct historical inaccuracies and provoke critical thinking about historical narratives. This is transformative fair use.**

**The song serves a fundamentally different purpose than Riven's:**
- Questions instead of celebrates
- Corrects inaccuracies instead of perpetuating them  
- Provokes critical thinking instead of mere memorization
- Presents nuanced history instead of simplified narrative

**The copying was reasonable for this critical purpose:**
- Needed to establish narrative being questioned
- 50% of final work is new critical content
- Can't effectively criticize claims without quoting them

**It was distributed noncommercially:**
- Nonprofit educational division
- At/below cost to schools
- Incidental parent company benefits don't defeat primary educational purpose

**It didn't harm any established market:**
- Riven had no contracts, no set prices, no budget approval
- Only preliminary discussions with one potential customer
- Schools chose EchoCraft's version because it's more accurate and educationally superior—not because it's cheap substitute
- Riven has no right to control market for criticism of his work

**This is exactly what fair use protects:** using portions of original work to create transformative criticism and commentary that educates and improves public discourse.

---

## VII. RIVEN'S LIKELY ARGUMENTS

### Factor 1: Not Transformative, Just Commercial Appropriation

**Riven will argue:**
- Both songs serve same educational market (high school history)
- Same format (rhyming couplets)
- Same subject matter (Paul Revere)
- Adding few lines doesn't transform purpose—just makes longer version
- Real purpose was commercial—boost company image, improve revenue
- "Criticism" pretextual—could have written entirely new song

**Post-Warhol concern:** When both works serve same market, transformativeness harder to show

### Factor 3: Excessive Copying

**Riven will argue:**
- 87.5% verbatim copying (7/8 lines)
- Didn't need to copy this much to make critical points
- Could have written new song with accurate facts
- Took "heart" of work—the core creative expression

### Factor 4: Direct Market Harm

**Riven will argue:**
- Lost Toobin deal directly because of EchoCraft
- Lost other potential school customers
- Market for educational songs about Revere destroyed
- $500 advance plus projected earnings from 5-10 songs
- Schools using EchoCraft's instead of his—that's market substitution

---

## VIII. OUTSTANDING RESEARCH NEEDS

To fully develop fair use defense, need Second Circuit precedent on:

### Factor 1: Transformative Purpose
1. **Educational criticism/commentary:** Cases on transformative use when correcting factual inaccuracies in educational works
2. **Same-purpose transformativeness:** Post-Warhol analysis when both works serve educational purposes
3. **Parody/criticism scope:** What qualifies as protected criticism vs. mere use
4. **Commercial vs. nonprofit:** When incidental commercial benefits defeat nonprofit educational purpose

### Factor 2: Nature of Work
5. **Weight of Factor 2:** How much Factor 2 matters when use is highly transformative (Campbell principle)

### Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality
6. **Reasonable amount for criticism:** How much copying permissible for educational critique
7. **Factual vs. creative content:** Whether copying mostly factual/historical content analyzed differently
8. **"Heart" of work:** When copying "heart" permissible for criticism

### Factor 4: Market Effect
9. **"Potential market" definition:** What level of concreteness required (established market vs. preliminary negotiations)
10. **Market substitution test:** Whether improved/corrected version substitutes for inaccurate original
11. **Transformative use and market:** How transformativeness affects market harm analysis (Campbell/Google Books)
12. **Derivative market for criticism:** Extent of copyright holder's rights over critical derivative works

---

## IX. THE STATUTORY INTERPRETATION BATTLE

**The fundamental question: Does copyright law permit using substantial portions of an educational work to create more accurate, critical version?**

### Riven's Interpretation

Copyright protects creative expression regardless of factual accuracy. Creator has right to control all uses, including improved versions. 87.5% copying is excessive regardless of educational purpose.

### EchoCraft's Interpretation  

**Fair use exists precisely to allow transformative criticism that improves public discourse—even when that requires substantial copying. Section 107 explicitly protects "criticism, comment... teaching."**

**Copyright doesn't give creators monopoly over:**
- Corrections of their factual errors
- Critical commentary on their work
- Educational improvements on their content

**Policy concerns supporting fair use:**
- Encouraging historically accurate education
- Enabling critical inquiry into received narratives
- Preventing creators from blocking criticism through copyright
- Promoting transformative works that add value to public discourse

**If Riven's view prevailed:**
- Creators could use copyright to suppress criticism
- Factual inaccuracies in educational materials couldn't be corrected
- Students taught false history because copyright blocks accurate versions
- Fair use doctrine meaningless for educational criticism

**The statute's purpose:** "Fair use of copyrighted work... for purposes such as criticism, comment... teaching... is not an infringement." This is that case.

---

## X. CONCLUSION

EchoCraft's song is transformative educational criticism distributed through nonprofit channels for teaching purposes. It corrects historical inaccuracies, provokes critical thinking, and adds substantial new content. The copying was reasonable for the critical purpose. It harmed no established market—only speculative potential sales. This is precisely what fair use protects. The district court correctly granted summary judgment.
